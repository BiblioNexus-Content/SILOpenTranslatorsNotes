## Revelation 1:1 (id: 522640)

### Section 1:1–3: John introduced his book

In this section, John indicated that the contents of the revelation were given to Jesus by God. Then Jesus gave it to an angel, and the angel gave it to John. John wrote it in this book for all believers to read.

These verses explain the purpose of the book, give information about the author, and offer a blessing to those who read the book.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> Introduction

> Introduction to the book

> Opening remarks/words of the book

Some translations do not start a book with a section heading. Consider whether or not you should use one.

#### 1:1a

**This is the revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him**

* ¶ This revelation is from Jesus Christ that God showed/told to him
* ¶ This book has secret/hidden knowledge/things that Jesus, the Messiah, revealed/showed. God had caused it/them to be known to him.

**This is the revelation of Jesus Christ:** In Greek this phase is more literally “The revelation of Jesus Christ.” This phrase introduces the book. In some languages it is more natural to translate this phrase as a complete clause or sentence, as the BSB and some other English versions have done. For example:

> This is the revelation of Jesus Christ. (BSB, GW)

> This book/letter/writing is the revelation of Jesus Christ,

This phrase indicates that Jesus Christ revealed the things in this book to John. Other ways to translate this are:

> This is a revelation from Jesus Christ, (NLT)

> The revelation from Jesus Christ (NIV11\)

> This book is the record of the events that Jesus Christ revealed. (GNT)

**revelation of Jesus Christ:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *revelation* refers to something unknown that someone shows/reveals to someone else. In some languages it is more natural to translate this phrase using a verb. For example:

> things revealed by Jesus Christ

> hidden things/knowledge that Jesus Christ told

> hidden/secret knowledge that Jesus Christ revealed

**Christ:** The word *Christ* is a title for Jesus. It means “the anointed one.” The Hebrew word *mashiah* (English: “Messiah”) has the same meaning. The Jews used it to refer to the person whom God promised would save/free his people and rule them. Here the word *Christ* describes Jesus as the *Christ*.

Some ways to translate *Christ* are:

* Use a title or a descriptive phrase in your language that has the same meaning as *Christ*. For example:

    > God’s Anointed/Chosen One

    > Promised Deliverer

    > the Rescuer\-King

* Use the major language word, spell it as people in your language would say it, and include a phrase that explains the meaning. For example:

    > Karisiti, the appointed one

    > Cristo, the Savior whom God promised to send

* Use the major language word, spell it as people in your language would say it, and indicate in some way that it is a title. For example:

    > the Kirisita

* Use the word Messiah, if it is more clearly a title used only for Jesus. Spell it as people in your language would say it and indicate in some way that it is a title. For example:

    > the MesaaiaThe spelling *Mesaaia* is based on the usage in the Nalik NT, in progress, Papua New Guinea.

If you have translated other New Testament books, see how you translated this word there. Also, if you have a footnote explaining this word in Matthew 1:1, Mark 1:1, Luke 2:11, or John 1:17, you may want to repeat it here.

**which God gave Him:** This clause tells the reader more about the revelation. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that Jesus had other revelations but God only gave this one to him. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about this revelation. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> It was given to him by God.

> God gave it to him.

**gave:** The word *gave* indicates that God showed these revelations to Jesus. In some languages a word other than *gave* is more natural. For example:

> showed (CEV)

> told

#### 1:1b

**to show His servants what must soon come to pass.**

* in order to show to his servants/slaves the things that are required to happen soon.
* God showed/told him these things so that his servants/workers might know the events that will certainly occur/happen soon.

**His servants:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *servants* refers to believers. It indicates that believers must obey the things God tells them to do.

The Greek word can also be translated as “slaves.” However, it is important not to indicate or imply that it is a position of shame or humiliation. A servant of God has a position of honor. Other ways to translate this word are:

> his workers

> the people who serve him

> his people, they work for him

> his people, they do his will

**His:** The pronoun *His* probably refers here to God.Compare the similar wording in Revelation 22:6\.

**must soon come to pass:** Here the phrase *must soon come to pass* indicates that the events in the revelation will certainly happen soon. God has decided that all these events will happen, so they will certainly happen. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> must soon happen (NCV)

> will soon necessarily/indeed occur

> has been determined by God to happen soon

> will definitely/certainly occur soon

#### 1:1c

**He made it known by sending His angel to His servant John,**

* Jesus Christ showed it to his servant/slave John by sending his angel to him.
* Jesus sent his angel/messenger to reveal these things to me, John, his servant/worker.

**He made…known:** The person that the pronoun *He* refers to is unclear. It is probably Jesus. In some languages it is more natural to say to whom this pronoun refers. For example:

> Christ made these things known (GNT)

**made…known:** This phrase refers to revealing something through signs. Here, the signs are things and events that have symbolic meanings. There are many things that are symbolic in Revelation, for example: the dragon (12:3\) and the woman on the scarlet beast (17:3\).

Jesus communicated this revelation to believers by sending his angel with the revelation to John. The angel showed the revelation to John. John wrote this revelation and sent it to the believers. Other ways to translate these words are:

> revealed through signs

> communicated (NASB)

> sent this revelation (GW)

> show (NCV)

**it:** The pronoun *it* refers to the revelation, namely, the things that Jesus revealed (1:1a).

**His angel:** The pronoun *His* probably refers here to Jesus.

**angel:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *angel* means “messenger.” It refers here to a spirit being who serves Christ. Some ways to translate this word are:

* Use a descriptive word or phrase. For example:

    > messenger

    > good/holy spirit\-being

* Use a local word that fits the biblical meaning.
* In some languages the churches may already be using the major language word for “angel.” Be sure that this word fits the biblical meaning. If some people do not know the right meaning from this word, you may want to indicate the meaning in some way. For example:

    > angel messenger

    > sacred angel spirit

Be sure that your word for “angel” is different from your words or phrases for “prophet” and “apostle.”

**to His servant John:** The name *John* refers to the author himself. John wrote about himself in the third person. This was good Greek style. In some languages it is more natural to use the first person. For example:

> to his servant John, me

> to me John, his servant

**His:** This pronoun refers here to Jesus.

**servant:** This word has the same meaning as it does in 1:1b.

**John:** The traditional view is that John the Apostle wrote this Revelation.Swete and others. But a second century Christian, Dionysius, thought is was someone named “John the Elder” and not John the Apostle.Aune and others. Many scholars refuse to choose which is most likely. It is best not to name this John as “the Apostle” or “the Elder.”

##### **General Comment on 1:1a–c**

In some languages it is more natural to follow the chronological order of communicating the message. For example:

> 1a This book is the revelation of Jesus Christ. God gave it to him. 1cHe made it known by sending his angel to his servant John,1bHe/God gave it to him to show his/God’s servants what must soon take place. 2aJohn testifies…

## Revelation 1:2 (id: 522641)

### Section 1:1–3: John introduced his book

In this section, John indicated that the contents of the revelation were given to Jesus by God. Then Jesus gave it to an angel, and the angel gave it to John. John wrote it in this book for all believers to read.

These verses explain the purpose of the book, give information about the author, and offer a blessing to those who read the book.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> Introduction

> Introduction to the book

> Opening remarks/words of the book

Some translations do not start a book with a section heading. Consider whether or not you should use one.

#### 1:2a–b

**who testifies to everything he saw. This is the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ:** The Greek words are literally “who testifies to the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ(,) whatever he saw.” The phrase “everything he saw” explains the phrase “This is the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.” In other words, both phrases refer to the messages, visions, and prophecies in this book. For example:

> who faithfully reported everything he saw. This is his report of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. (NLT)

> John testified about what he saw: God’s word and the testimony about Jesus Christ. (GW)

> who has told everything he has seen. It is the word of God; it is the message from Jesus Christ. (NCV)

#### 1:2a

**who testifies to everything he saw.**

* John tells here about everything he saw.
* And I am faithfully reporting in this book everything that I saw and heard.

**who testifies:** This clause tells the reader more about John (1:1c). In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there were other people named John who received this message and only this John *testifies*. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about John. For example:

> John testifies

> and I testify

**testifies:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *testifies* means “to tell/report what one saw, heard, or knows.” The word is often used when the person speaking is expected to be truthful and accurate. Other ways to translate this word are:

> faithfully reported (NLT)

> told…about (CEV)

> has borne witness (NJB)

The Greek grammar is usually translated with the English past tense. Many English versions use the past tense here, as in the NLT example above. But since John will tell his readers the revelation after this, the BSB uses the present tense. The present tense in English here refers generally to what he wrote in this book. Use the tense that is natural in your language. For example:

> is testifying

> testified

**everything he saw:** John implies everything that he heard as well. In some languages a literal translation would not imply that. If that is true in your language, include the implied meaning in your translation. For example:

> everything he saw and heard

#### 1:2b

**This is the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.**

* Indeed, he tells here the word of/from God and the witness of/from Jesus Christ.
* It is exactly what God said to me and the truth that Jesus Christ revealed.

**This is:** In the Greek the phrase “everything he saw” explains the phrase “the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.” The BSB adds the words *This is* to indicate the connection between the two phrases. See the note on 1:2a–b for other ways to translate the connection between these phrases.

**the word of God:** The phrase *the word of God* here indicates that *the word* was from *God*. It is not one word but a message. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the message from God (GNT)

> this word from/of God

> the true words of God

> the things that God said to me

**the testimony of Jesus Christ:** The word *of* here allows two meanings: the testimony that Jesus Christ spoke, and the testimony about Jesus.

The first meaning refers to what he said in chapters 2 and 3, his words in 22:7 to obey the words of this book, and in 22:16 he said that this book was a testimony that he sent to the churches.

The second meaning refers to what this book says about Jesus, for example 1:10–18 and 19:11–16\.

Both meanings are true here. In many languages the word *of* allows both meanings. If that is true in your language, use *of* here. But some languages must choose one meaning or the other. If that is true in your language, translate the first meaning.Aune (page 19\) says, “‘the witness borne by Jesus’…seems more likely (and) suggests that the phrase…means ‘the contents of this book.’” Osbourne (page 56\) says, “In 1:1–2…Jesus functions as the revealer of divine truth, and so the subjective sense is strongly favored by the context….” Some ways to translate this phrase with that meaning are:

> the truth revealed by Jesus Christ (GNT)

> the message from Jesus Christ (NCV)

**testimony:** The word *testimony* means “the words spoken about what one knows.” It implies that the spoken words are truthful and accurate. Other ways to translate this word are:

> witness (NJB)

> true message

##### **General Comment on 1:2a–b**

In the Greek, the phrase “to everything he saw” occurs at the end of the verse. In some languages it is more natural to follow this order. For example:

> John testifies to the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ, namely, everything he saw and heard.

> who testifies to the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. With/By this talk, he means everything he saw and heard.

## Revelation 1:3 (id: 522645)

### Section 1:1–3: John introduced his book

In this section, John indicated that the contents of the revelation were given to Jesus by God. Then Jesus gave it to an angel, and the angel gave it to John. John wrote it in this book for all believers to read.

These verses explain the purpose of the book, give information about the author, and offer a blessing to those who read the book.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> Introduction

> Introduction to the book

> Opening remarks/words of the book

Some translations do not start a book with a section heading. Consider whether or not you should use one.

#### 1:3a

**Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy,**

* ¶ The person who reads the words of this prophecy is favored,
* ¶ God gives goodness/blessing to the people who read the words of this message that he has revealed,
* ¶ God blesses the people who read this prophecy

**Blessed:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Blessed* describes a person who is in a good situation. In the Bible, the good situation results from God showing favor/kindness to the person.

This word does not primarily refer to a feeling. However, a person in this good situation will frequently have good feelings like happiness and joy. Do not use a word that only refers to material prosperity or physical health.

Other ways to translate this word are:

> Favored

> How good it is

> In a good/desirable position in God’s eyes

> Shown kindness by God

This is the same word used in Matthew 5:3–11 in the Beatitudes.

**reads aloud:** In Greek, the word that the BSB translates as *reads aloud* is more literally “reading.” The BSB supplies the word *aloud* because at that time the word “reading” normally referred to reading aloud, either to oneself or to others. People did not normally read silently. The context here implies reading aloud to a group (1:3b). However, if possible, translate this word so that it can refer to any kind of reading (See the ESV translation in the Display).

**prophecy:** The word *prophecy* refers to a message that God gives to someone. The message may include a vision, as in Ezekiel 1 and Daniel 8\. A *prophecy* may reveal something about past events, current events, or future events. The prophet speaks the *prophecy* to the people or writes it down for their use.

Many scholars believe that Revelation 2:1 through 3:22 are prophecies about things that were happening at the time John received this revelation. Many also believe that 4:1 through 22:17 are prophecies about future events.

Some languages do not have a word for *prophecy*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > direct message from God

    > God’s new message

    > a message that God has revealed

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > The word “prophecy” refers to a message that God gives to someone. The message may include a vision. A prophecy may reveal something about past events, current events, or future events.

#### 1:3b

**and blessed are those who hear and obey what is written in it,**

* and favored are those who hear it and obey the things that are written in it,
* and the people who listen carefully to it and follow it are also in a good place in God’s eyes,

**those who hear and obey what is written in it:** John referred here to the people who were listening to someone reading this prophecy aloud (1:3a). He was indicating that people who *hear* the words of this prophecy also have to *obey what is written* before they are blessed.

**obey:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *obey* is literally “keep” (as in the RSV). Here the word “keep” refers to following what was said and valuing it. Other ways to translate the Greek word are:

> live according to it

> do what is written in it (NCV)

#### 1:3c

**because the time is near.**

* because the time for these things to occur is near/soon.
* for these events/prophecies will happen soon.

**the time is near:** This clause indicates that the events in this prophecy will happen soon. Some languages may need to say explicitly what time is near. For example:

> the time is near when all these things will happen (GNT)

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:3

## Revelation 1:4 (id: 522646)

### Section 1:4–8: John greeted the churches and praised Jesus

In this section, John identified himself and indicated to whom the letter was addressed. He greeted them in the usual way that was done in letters at that time. He then praised Jesus and told the readers of this letter what its theme was.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> Greetings to the Seven Churches (GNT)

> John introduced himself and greeted the seven churches

> Greeting and introduction from John

#### 1:4a–b

**John, To the seven churches in the province of Asia:** After John introduced the content and purpose of this letter and announced a blessing (1:1–3\), here he identified himself and those to whom he was writing. Other languages may use another order or other introduction words. For example:

> From John to the seven churches in the province of Asia (GNT)

> This letter is from John to the seven churches in the province of Asia (NLT)

> To the seven churches in the province of Asia. This letter is from me, John

#### 1:4a

**John,**

* ¶ From John,
* ¶ I John am writing this letter

**John:** John is the name of the person who wrote the letter. In some languages it is more natural to make this clear by using the first\-person pronoun, “I.” For example:

> I am John. I write to the seven churches in Asia

> I, John, am writing this letter to the seven churches in the province of Asia

#### 1:4b

**To the seven churches in the province of Asia:**

* to the seven churches in the province of Asia.
* to the seven gatherings of believers which are in the province of Asia.
* to the communities of God’s people in the province of Asia.

**To the seven churches in the province of Asia:** The phrase *the seven churches in the province of Asia* refers to seven groups of believers in Asia. The phrase does not imply that only seven groups of believers existed in Asia.

**seven churches:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *churches* refers generally to a gathering of people. Someone summoned the people for a particular purpose. Here, as almost always in the NT, it refers to groups of believers.

In the Bible this word never refers to church buildings. You also should not use a phrase that refers to separate groupings of churches where each group has its own name. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> seven congregations

> the believers who live in seven cities

> the seven gatherings of believers

**the province of Asia:** The BSB adds the phrase *the province of*. At that time the name “Asia” referred only to a small region in what is now the western part of the country of Turkey. But in English the name now refers to a large region of the world that includes the country of China. So the BSB and some English versions add the phrase the province of to indicate the old meaning.

You may also want to explain its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

> At that time, the name Asia referred to a province under Roman rule that was across the Aegean Sea east of Greece. It was in the western part of what is now the country of Turkey.

#### 1:4c

**Grace and peace to you**

* Grace and peace be yours (GNT)
* I pray that you(plur) may experience/enjoy grace and peace
* May you receive kindness/favor and well\-being/harmonious\-living

**Grace and peace to you:** The saying *Grace and peace to you* was a common greeting among believers at that time. So authors of the books in the New Testament usually began their books that way.

This greeting has no verb. In some languages it is more natural to add a verb. For example:

> May grace and peace be given to you

> May you receive grace and peace

> Grace and peace be yours (GNT)

**Grace:** The word *Grace* here refers to God being kind to those who do not deserve it. God does things for people because he wants to and not because they earned it. Other ways to translate this are:

> kindness (CEV)

> help

> favor

In some languages, it is necessary to translate *Grace* using a verb. For example:

> voluntarily/graciously be kind

> help as a gift/favor

If you need to translate *Grace* using a verb, you may need to reorder the sentence. This is discussed in the General Comment on 1:4c–5c.

**peace:** In Jewish culture the word *peace* describes a situation of well\-being that can include safety, wholeness, and health. It often describes harmony and friendship between God and people, or between individuals or groups of people. Other ways to translate *peace* here are:

> harmony

> wellness

In some languages, it is necessary to translate *peace* using a verb. For example:

> live whole/well/peacefully

> be calm/peaceful

Again, you may need to refer to the General Comment on 1:4c–5c for ways to reorder the sentence.

#### 1:4d

**from Him who is and was and is to come,**

* from the one who is and was and is coming,
* from God who exists now, and who has always existed, and who is to come,
* from God. He is the one who exists, who existed, and who is coming.

**from Him who is and was and is to come:** These words refer to God. John described God here in the middle of his request for grace and peace.

John described God using three phrases. In your translation, make sure that it is clear that the one *who is*, the one who *was*, and the one who *is to come* all refer to God. Other ways to translate this saying are:

> from the One who is and was and is coming (NCV)

> from him who exists, who always existed and who is coming

> from God, who is, who was, and who is to come (GNT)

**is to come:** The clause *is to come* uses a different Greek verb that the verb used in the previous two clauses. Those clauses use the verb meaning “be/exist.” The verb in this clause probably refers to God coming to do the things written in this book. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> who is still to come (NLT)

> who is coming (GW)

The clause *is to come* does not refer to Jesus returning. So you should not translate this as “who is to return.”

#### 1:4e

**and from the seven Spirits before His throne,**

* from the seven spirits in front of his throne,
* and from the sevenfold Spirit who is in his presence before his ruling place/seat,
* May you also receive kindness/favor and well\-being/calm from the seven spirits serving God in front of his throne.

**from the seven Spirits:** This phrase is connected to “Grace and peace to you” (1:4c). It indicates that John also asked the seven spirits to give grace and peace.

**the seven Spirits:** Many scholars believe that the phrase *the seven Spirits* is a symbolic reference to the Holy Spirit.Beale, Swete, Smalley, Osbourne, Lenski, Kistemaker, Johnson, Beckwith, and Hughes. The number *seven* then represents completion or perfection. Other scholars believe that the phrase refers to seven angels.Aune and Charles. These angels could be either seven archangels, or seven other spirits who serve God. Since the meaning of this phrase is not clear, you may want to:

* Translate literally. You may also want to explain the various opinions about its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Scholars have several opinions about the words “the seven spirits.” Some think the words refer symbolically to the Holy Spirit. Others think the words refer to seven angels of highest rank. Others think that the words refer to seven spirits of a special kind that only serve God at the throne.

* Indicate that the phrase refers symbolically to the Holy Spirit. For example:

    > the Spirit symbolized by the word/number seven *If you do that, then you may want to include a footnote to indicate the literal words. An example footnote is:*

    > Literally: “the seven spirits.” John may have used this phrase to refer to the Holy Spirit, seven angels of highest rank, or seven spirits of a special kind who serve God at the throne.

**before His throne:** Here the phrase *before His throne* indicates that the seven spirits are always in God’s presence. It is implied that God is seated on his throne. It is more clear in some languages to indicate the implied information. For example:

> before the throne where God is seated

**throne:** This word refers to the official chair of a king. When the king is seated on his *throne*, he rules over his people and his country. Therefore, the word *throne* is a symbol for authority to rule. Another way to translate this word is:

> leader’s place to rule

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:4

## Revelation 1:5 (id: 522647)

### Section 1:4–8: John greeted the churches and praised Jesus

In this section, John identified himself and indicated to whom the letter was addressed. He greeted them in the usual way that was done in letters at that time. He then praised Jesus and told the readers of this letter what its theme was.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> Greetings to the Seven Churches (GNT)

> John introduced himself and greeted the seven churches

> Greeting and introduction from John

#### 1:5a–c

**from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth:** The three phrases *the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth* all describe Jesus.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other people named Jesus Christ and only this one is *the faithful witness*, and so forth. If that is true in your language, translate these words so that they tell more about Jesus Christ. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> Jesus Christ. He is the faithful witness. He is the firstborn from the dead, and he rules the kings of the earth.

> Jesus Christ. Jesus is the faithful witness, the first among those raised from the dead. He is the ruler of the kings of the earth. (NCV)

#### 1:5a

**and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness,**

* and from Jesus Christ, the trustworthy witness,
* and from Jesus Christ, who reliably and accurately reports/explains all things.
* May you(plur) also receive kindness/favor and well\-being/calm from Jesus Christ. He faithfully confirms all that God has said.

**and from Jesus Christ:** The word *from* refers back to the greeting of “Grace and peace to you” (1:4c). It indicates that John also asked Jesus to give grace and peace.

In some languages it is necessary or more natural to repeat the greeting phrase here. For example:

> and grace and peace to you from Jesus Christ

> May Jesus Christ also give you grace and peace

See other examples in the General Comment on 1:4c–5c.

**faithful:** Here the Greek word that the BSB translates as *faithful* refers to being worthy of trust.BDAG (page 820\). People can depend on that person. Here the word indicates that Jesus was completely reliable, dependable, and truthful in what he said. Other ways to translate this word are:

> dependable

> trustworthy (GW)

> truthful

**witness:** This word refers to a person who tells what he has seen, heard, or come to know. The Greek word that means *witness* is closely related to “testifies” (1:2a) and “testimony” (1:2b). Other ways to translate this word are:

> testifier

> one who speaks about what he knows

> one who reports/explains

#### 1:5b

**the firstborn from the dead,**

* the firstborn raised from the dead,
* He is the first person/one who arose from death,

**the firstborn from the dead:** This phrase also describes Jesus. This phrase uses the word *firstborn* in a figurative way. It indicates that God resurrected Jesus first, before other people.

This phrase also implies that God will resurrect other people later. Jesus has authority over all believers, just like a Jewish *firstborn* son had the position of authority over his brothers and sisters.

In some languages, a literal translation would not clearly indicate the figurative meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the figure of speech in your translation. For example:

    > the firstborn in place/position and time from the dead

    > the first person to return from the dead permanently/forever and he also has the authority/position of a firstborn

* Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:

    > the first to be raised from death (GNT)

    > was the first to conquer death (CEV)

    > the first to rise forever from the dead

    > the first one that God raised from death *You may then want to explain the literal word in a footnote. An example footnote is:*

    > Literally: “firstborn.” This word indicates that God resurrected Jesus first, before other people. The word also implies that Jesus has authority over all believers, just like a Jewish firstborn son had the position of authority over his brothers and sisters.

#### 1:5c

**and the ruler of the kings of the earth.**

* and the ruler over the rulers of the world.
* and he rules all the kings/rulers on earth.
* (reordered) May he who is, and who was, and who is to come, and the seven spirits before his throne, and Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth, give grace and peace to you.

**the ruler of the kings of the earth:** This phrase also describes Jesus. It indicates that Jesus rules kings, chiefs, and all other rulers on earth. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the commander of all the rulers of the world (NLT96\)

> Jesus rules all the rulers on earth

##### **General Comment on 1:4c–5c**

This greeting is complicated. John asked God, the seven spirits, and Jesus to give grace and peace to the believers. He also described God, the seven spirits, and Jesus. In some languages it is more natural to:

* First translate the three descriptions, and then translate what John wanted each one to do. For example:

    > 4dMay he who is, and who was, and who is to come, 4ethe seven spirits before his throne, 5aand Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, 5bthe firstborn from the dead, 5cand the ruler of the kings of the earth 4cgive grace and peace to you. *You then would need to combine the verse marking for these verses as “4–5\.”*

* Translate the first two descriptions as well as “Jesus Christ,” followed by what John wanted each one to do. Then translate the description of Jesus Christ. For example:

    > 4dMay he who is, and who was, and who is to come, 4ethe seven spirits before his throne, 5aand Jesus Christ, 4cgive grace and peace to you. 5aJesus Christ is the faithful witness, 5bthe firstborn from the dead, 5cand the ruler of the kings of the earth *You then would need to combine the verse marking for these verses as “4–5\.”*

* Repeat the grace and peace blessing for each person/subject. For example:

    > 4cGrace and peace to you 4dfrom him who is, and who was, and who is to come. 4eGrace and peace to you from the seven spirits before his throne. 5aGrace and peace to you from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, 5bthe firstborn from the dead, 5cand the ruler of the kings of the earth.

    > 4c–dMay he who is, and who was, and who is to come give grace and peace to you. 4eMay the seven spirits before his throne give grace and peace to you. 5aAnd may Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, 5bthe firstborn from the dead, 5cand the ruler of the kings of the earth give grace and peace to you.

    > 4cI pray that you will be blessed with kindness and peace 4dfrom God, who is and was and is coming. 4eMay you receive kindness and peace from the seven spirits before the throne of God. 5aMay kindness and peace be yours from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness. 5bJesus was the first to conquer death, 5cand he is the ruler of all earthly kings. (CEV) *You may need to combine the verse marking for these verses as “4–5\.”*

#### 1:5d–6b

1:5d–1:6b is one long sentence. It includes a long description of Jesus (1:5d–1:6a). At the end of the sentence (1:6b), John described glory and power as belonging to Jesus. In some languages it is more natural to use two or more shorter sentences. For example:

> 5d Jesus Christ loves us 5eand has freed us from our sins by his own blood. 6aHe has made us to be a kingdom, priests to serve his God and Father. 6bTo him be glory and power forever and ever! Amen.

For an example of how to reorder the information in these clauses, see the General Comment at the end of the notes on 1:6b.

#### 1:5d

**To Him who loves us**

* ¶ To the one who loves us(incl)
* ¶ Jesus Christ loves us,

**To Him:** The pronoun *Him* refers to Jesus as is made clear in 1:5e–6a.

**loves:** The word *loves* refers to a strong feeling of affection and concern for a person. It also refers to an attitude of actively seeking the good of another. Your language may have a word or idiom for saying this.

#### 1:5e

**and has released us from our sins by His blood,**

* and has freed/released us(incl) from our sins by shedding/giving his blood,
* and by dying as a sacrifice, he has freed us from the punishment of our sins.

**has released us from our sins by His blood:** There is a textual issue here about the Greek word that the BSB translates as *released*:

1. Some Greek manuscripts have freed. For example:

    > released us from our sins by His blood (BSB, NASB) *(BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NASB, NABRE, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, REB, ESV, NCV)*

2. Some Greek manuscripts have washed. For example:

    > washed us from our sins in his own blood (KJV) *(KJV, NJB)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\). The earliest Greek manuscripts support “freed/released.”

**has released us from our sins:** This phrase indicates that Jesus has released believers from their sins. They are no longer guilty in God’s eyes and no longer have to suffer God’s anger.

Some commentators suggest that the phrase also refers to believers no longer being under the power of sin. If possible, translate in a way that allows both meanings. For example:

> has freed us from our sins and their power

> released us from our sins (NASB)

**by His blood:** Here the word *blood* refers figuratively to Jesus’ death. The phrase *by His blood* indicates that Jesus’ death was the way to free believers from their sins. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> by shedding his blood (NLT)

> by his sacrificial death (GNT)

> through his life/shed blood

* **Associated Passages:** REV 1:5

## Revelation 1:6 (id: 522649)

### Section 1:4–8: John greeted the churches and praised Jesus

In this section, John identified himself and indicated to whom the letter was addressed. He greeted them in the usual way that was done in letters at that time. He then praised Jesus and told the readers of this letter what its theme was.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> Greetings to the Seven Churches (GNT)

> John introduced himself and greeted the seven churches

> Greeting and introduction from John

#### 1:6a

**who has made us to be a kingdom, priests to His God and Father—**

* and has made us into a kingdom; we are priests serving God his Father—
* He caused us to live under God’s rule, where we are like priests, doing the will of his Father God.

**has made us to be a kingdom, priests:** There are two issues here.

Issue 1—The Greek text

There is a textual issue here:

1. The earliest Greek manuscripts have the word “kingdom.” *(BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV)*
2. Some later Greek manuscripts have the word “kings. *(KJV, CEV)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\).

Issue 2—Meaning

The Greek words are literally “has made us to be a kingdom, priests” (as in the BSB). There are several ways to interpret the Greek phrase:

1. It indicates that the words *priests* and *kingdom* describe the same thing, as in the RSV. *(BSB, RSV, NASB, NABRE, GW, NET, REB, ESV)*
2. It indicates that the *kingdom* consists of *priests*. For example:

    > made us a kingdom of priests (GNT) *(GNT, NJB, NLT, NCV)*

3. It indicates two things unconnected or only loosely connected with each other. He made his people to be *a kingdom*, and he also made them *priests*. For example:

    > He has made us his kingdom and his priests (NLT96\) *(NIV, NLT96\)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because the Greek words do not have “and” here, nor the grammar indicating “of.” Hughes, Aune, Swete, and Lenski support interpretation (1\). Swete (page 8\) says that adding *and* or *of* “are needless attempts to save the grammar.” Other ways to translate these words according to interpretation (1\) are:

> made us a kingdom, that is, priests

> made us a kingdom. He also made us priests

**made us to be a kingdom:** These words mean “has caused us to become a united group under one king/leader.” God is the king. Some other ways to translate this phrase are:

> has caused us to become a nation/tribe/people\-group

> has appointed us as a kingdom (NET)

**priests to His God and Father:** The Greek words are literally “priests to his God and Father” (as in the BSB). This is a metaphor. Believers are like priests.

They are like priests because they serve God as a way of life. They devote themselves to doing what God wants them to do. There are several ways to translate this figure of speech:

* Keep the figure of speech. For example:

    > priests for God his Father (GW)

* Change the metaphor to a simile. For example:

    > to become like priests of his Father God

* Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:

    > those who serve/worship God his Father

* Keep the metaphor or simile *priests* and explain the meaning. For example:

    > priests serving his God and Father (NET)

Translate this figure of speech in a way that makes the meaning clear in your language. Whether you are able to keep the figure of *priests* will depend partly on the role and function of priests in your culture. See the following note.

**priests:** A Jewish priest was a religious leader who:

1. offered sacrifices to God for the people,
2. led the people in worship, and
3. taught the people about God.

Here the word *priests* refers figuratively to people who serve God as a way of life. They worship God and help others to worship him also. Since Jesus died on the cross as our sacrifice, Christians do not offer sacrifices. If your usual word or phrase for *priests* focuses on sacrificing animals and food, you should translate the figurative meaning of *priests* here. For example:

> those who always serve God his Father

> people doing his Father God’s will/desire as a way of life

**His God and Father:** The pronoun *His* refers to Jesus. The word *Father* refers to *God*. In your translation, make sure that it is clear that the phrases *His God* and *Father* both refer to the one true God. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> God his Father (CEV)

> his God and Father

#### 1:6b

**to Him be the glory and power forever and ever! Amen.**

* to him goes glory and power for all time! Amen.
* He is great and he has power eternally! It is true.
* He has praise and rules mightily/powerfully throughout all ages! It is so.

**to Him be the glory and power:** The Greek words are literally “to him glory and power.” There is no verb in the Greek. The BSB and many other English versions add the verb *be*. This phrase indicates that John agreed that Jesus had glory and power. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> to him is glory and power

> he is the one who is great and who has power forever

> glory and power belong to him

**to Him:** The pronoun *Him* refers to Jesus.

**glory:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *glory* here refers to the recognition of God having great status. He is greater than anything a person could think of.See also Luke 2:14, Romans 11:36, Ephesians 3:21, or Philippians 4:20 for the same use of the word *glory*.

**power:** This word refers to the ability and authority to cause things to happen. It does not refer to physical strength here. The RSV translates it as:

> dominion

**forever and ever:** The Greek words are “into the ages of the ages.” It means “always” or “eternally.” Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> for evermore

> for all ages to come

**Amen:** The word *Amen* is a Hebrew word that means “even so” or “it is true.” It is used to agree with what was said. The Greek borrowed the Hebrew word. English borrowed this word as well.

In some languages people are not familiar with this word. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

##### **General Comment on 1:5d–6b**

* Translate the meaning. For example:

    > It is so.

    > True!

* Borrow this word and spell it as people in your language would say it. You may then want to explain its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > The word “amen” means “even so” or “it is true.”

These clauses contain a description of Jesus Christ and what he has done (1:5d–6a), followed by a call to praise him (1:6b). In some languages it is more natural to translate 1:6b first, and then tell about who Jesus is and what he did (1:5d–6a). For example:

> 6bGlory and power be to him! 5dHe has loved us 5eand shed his blood to free us from our sins! 6aAnd he has made us into a kingdom, priests to serve his God and Father!

If you do this, you will need to combine the verses as “5–6\.”

#### 1:5d–6b

**(reordered) He who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and Father has glory and power for ever and ever! Amen.**

* (reordered) He loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood, and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and Father. Glory and power for ever and ever belong to him! Amen.

In this section, John identified himself and indicated to whom the letter was addressed. He greeted them in the usual way that was done in letters at that time. He then praised Jesus and told the readers of this letter what its theme was.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> Greeting and introduction from John

#### 1:7a

**Behold, He is coming with the clouds,**

* See/Hey, he is coming with the clouds,
* Listen/Wow! He will come soon with the clouds around him.

**Behold:** The word emphasizes or calls attention to the words that follow. The word is also used here in a somewhat literal sense, because when Jesus does come, people will indeed see him. Translate this in a way that is natural in your language for talking about a wonderful or amazing event that people will see. Other ways to translate this word are:

> Hey/Wow

> Remember/Consider this:

**He is coming with the clouds:** The pronoun *He* refers to Jesus Christ here. John named him in 1:5a. In some languages it is more natural to translate the pronoun *He* using his name because of the many words used following the mention of his name in 1:5a. For example:

> Jesus is coming with the clouds (NCV)

This clause is similar to prophecies in the Gospels, including Matthew 24:30\. This clause is also similar to Daniel 7:13\. You may want a footnote to explain the connection to those prophecies. An example footnote is:

> This clause is like the prophecy in Matthew 24:30\. It is also similar to Daniel 7:13\.

**He is coming:** This phrase uses the present tense. John used the present tense to emphasize that Jesus is definitely coming soon. However, the rest of the verse uses the future tense. In some languages it is more natural to use the future tense here also. For example:

> He will definitely come soon

**with the clouds:** This phrase indicates that clouds will be near Jesus as he returns. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> on the clouds (GNT)

> in company with the clouds

#### 1:7b

**and every eye will see Him—**

* and the eyes of everyone will see him,
* All people will see him,

**every eye will see Him:** The phrase *every eye* is an idiom that means “everyone.” For example:

> everyone will see him (NCV)

#### 1:7c

**even those who pierced Him.**

* including those who pierced him,
* including those who stabbed him,

**even:** Here the word *even* means “including” (as in the GNT).

**those who pierced Him:** This phrase comes from Zechariah 12:10\. Here it refers to the soldiers who pierced Jesus with nails and to the soldier who pierced him with a spear. But the phrase also refers to the leaders who ordered the soldiers to pierce him. More generally, it includes all people who are enemies of Jesus (John 19:34, 37\).

In some languages it is more natural to say how people *pierced* Jesus. But the important point is that these people caused Jesus to die. For example:

> those who pierced his skin with nails and spear

> those who nailed him to a cross so that he would die

> the people who caused him to die by nailing him to a cross

#### 1:7d

**And all the tribes of the earth will mourn because of Him.**

* and all the people\-groups of the world will grieve regarding him.
* and all the tribes/nations on earth will sorrow greatly on account of seeing him.

**all the tribes of the earth:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *tribes* refers to people grouped by language or culture. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> all peoples of the earth (NIV)

> all the people\-groups of the world

**mourn:** This word refers to being very sad or grieving. Other ways to translate this word are:

> grieve

> have great sorrow

**because of Him:** There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as *because of*:

1. It indicates that he is the reason they mourn, but it leaves unclear the question of why he is the reason they mourn. For example, it may be that he is coming to judge them, or it may be that they are sad that he suffered. For example:

    > on account of him (RSV) *(BSB, RSV, NIV, GW, CEV, NET,A footnote in the NET says “they will mourn because he comes as judge.” NCV, NLT96, ESV, KJV)*

2. It indicates here that the people mourn because they are sad that Jesus suffered. For example:

    > over him (GNT) *(GNT, NASB, NJB, NLT)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because the Greek allows for several reasons for the people to mourn.Kistemaker, Barnett, Osbourne, Smalley, and Beckwith support interpretation (1\). Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> on account of seeing him

> regarding him

> because they rejected him

#### 1:7e

**So shall it be! Amen.**

* Yes indeed! Amen.
* Yes! Even so!

**So shall it be! Amen:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *So shall it be!* is literally “Yes!” Like the word *Amen*, the word “yes” is used to express agreement that something is true. The two words are used together to emphasize that John strongly agreed. Other ways to translate these words are:

> Yes! Amen! (NLT)

> Even so. Amen. (RSV)

> Indeed! True!

#### 1:8a

**“I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God,**

* ¶ The Lord God says, “I am the Alpha and Omega.”
* ¶ The Lord God now/then said, “I am the First and the Last over all things.”

**I am the Alpha and the Omega:** There is a textual issue in 1:8a: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the phrase the Alpha and the Omega (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the phrases the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT recommends it. The NLT follows option (1\) but explains the idiom in the text: “the Alpha and the Omega—the beginning and the end,” as the footnote in the NLT shows. *Alpha* is the name of the first letter of the Greek alphabet. *Omega* is the name of the last letter of that alphabet. Here the phrase *the Alpha and the Omega* is used as a title. It is also a figure of speech. So this saying indicates that:

1. God is eternal.
2. He has authority over the beginning and the end of all things. This implies that everything in between the beginning and the end is also under his authority. He has control over all things and events.

In some languages a literal translation would not have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:

    > I am the One with authority over the first things and the last things

    > I am the One with all authority from start to finish

    > I am the start and the finish *You may then want to indicate the literal words and its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:*

    > Literally: “the Alpha and the Omega.” Alpha and Omega are the names of the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet. This phrase is an idiom. It indicates that God exists eternally and has authority over all things.

* Substitute the first and the last letters of your own alphabet. For example:

    > I am the A and the Z (GW) *You may then want to indicate the literal words and its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:*

    > Literally: “the Alpha and the Omega.” Alpha and Omega are the names of the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet. This phrase is an idiom. It indicates that God exists eternally and controls all things.

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in your translation. For example:

    > I am the Alpha and the Omega—the beginning and the end (NLT)

    > I am the Alpha and the Omega, which means I am the One with authority over the first things and the last things

    > I am the Alpha and the Omega, that is, the One who is in control from start to finish

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Alpha and Omega are the names of the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet. This phrase is an idiom. It indicates that God exists eternally and controls all things.

This title is similar in meaning to the titles “The First and the Last” (1:17, 2:8, 22:13\) and “The Beginning and End” (21:6, 22:13\). If possible, you should translate the three titles in similar but different ways. This is helpful, since all three titles occur in 22:13\.

**I:** The pronoun *I* is emphasized in the Greek. If you have a natural way to emphasize the pronoun *I* here, you may want to do so.

**says the Lord God:** The BSB places the phrase *says the Lord God* after what *God* said. The BSB also places the verb *says* before the phrase *the Lord God*. That order is a poetic English style. The BSB word order follows the Greek word order literally. You should place this phrase where it is most natural in your language.

**says:** John probably used the present tense to indicate that God always describes himself as the Alpha and the Omega.

**the Lord God:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Lord* means “the one in authority over (others),” or “owner.” Here the word is used to indicate that God has authority over all things. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> God the Lord

> Sovereign God

#### 1:8b

**who is and was and is to come—the Almighty.**

* He is the one who is and was and is coming, God All\-Powerful.
* God exists now, and has always existed, and will come. He is the Almighty God.

**who is and was and is to come—the Almighty:** There are two ways to interpret who spoke these words:

1. Here John spoke about God. Versions that follow this interpretation do not put quotation marks around these words. For example:

    > the one who is, and who was, and who is still to come—the All\-Powerful! (NET) *(BSB, RSV, GNT, NJB, GW, NET, REB)*

2. Here God continued speaking about himself. Versions that follow this interpretation put quotation marks around these words. For example:

    > “who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.” (NASB) *(NIV, NASB, NABRE, NLT, CEV, ESV, NCV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because 1:8a uses “I” but 1:8b uses a word ending that means “he.”Mounce (page 73\) says “The latter portion of the verse is not spoken by God but about him. The use of the threefold title in 1:4 and the third person in ‘and \[he] was’ supports this position.”

**who is and was and is to come:** Translate this saying as you did in 1:4\.

**the Almighty:** The word *Almighty* means “the one with the power to do anything.” This is a title for God. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the God of all power

> the one who has all power

To translate naturally in your language, you may need to put this title in a separate sentence. For example:

> He is the Almighty.

## Revelation 1:9 (id: 522655)

### Section 1:9–20: John introduced the revelation

In this section, John told the seven churches that he was exiled on the island of Patmos because he had preached about Jesus. The people in the seven churches had also suffered for the sake of Jesus. So John indicated that they all shared in that suffering. He explained where he was and why he was there. He then began to tell his vision of Jesus and what Jesus revealed to him.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> Preliminary vision (NJB)

> John told/described his first vision

> Introduction to what God revealed to John

#### 1:9a–e

**(reordered) I, John,** **proclaimed** **the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. Therefore I was** **put/exiled** **on the island of Patmos. I am your brother and companion in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are ours in Jesus.**

* (reordered) I, John, preached the word from God and testified/witnessed about Jesus. Therefore some people sent me to the island of Patmos. I am a fellow believer with you and share with you in suffering hardship, in doing the King’s work and in enduring/persevering, since we(incl) all follow Jesus together.

This verse is one long sentence. In some languages it is more natural to use shorter sentences. For example:

> I, John, am your brother and companion in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are ours in Jesus. One day, I was on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.

#### 1:9a

**I, John, your brother and partner**

* ¶ I, John, your(plur) brother and your partner
* ¶ I, John, am a fellow believer with you and share with you

**I, John:** John included his name here to clearly say who was speaking, because in the previous verse God referred to himself with the pronoun “I.” Reintroduce John in a way that is natural in your language. For example:

> I, John, speak/write to you. I,…

> I am John,…

**your brother:** Here the word *brother* indicates that John was also a believer, like believers in the churches. Using the word *brother* indicates that he had a close relationship with his readers.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate a literal brother. If that is true in your language, you may need to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > your brother in Christ

* Use a different word or phrase. For example:

    > your fellow believer

    > a follower together with all of you (CEV)

**partner:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *partner* refers to someone who shares something with someone else. Here John and the believers shared faith in Jesus. They also shared in suffering for Jesus’ sake, and in being part of God’s kingdom, and in enduring (1:9b). Other ways to translate the Greek word are:

> companion (NIV)

> one who shares with

#### 1:9b

**in the tribulation and kingdom and perseverance**

* in persecution, in the kingdom, and in patience to endure
* in suffering hardship, in doing the King’s work and in enduring/persevering,

**in the tribulation and kingdom and perseverance:** This phrase indicates that John and his readers shared in three things. They shared in *tribulation*, they shared in the *kingdom*, and they shared in *perseverance*. The three abstract nouns *tribulation*, *kingdom*, and *perseverance* can all be translated as verbs, since they refer to something that John and his readers did together. They all suffered, they all lived in God’s kingdom, and they all endured patiently.

In the Greek, these three things are closely connected in the grammar.All three are datives under one Greek article. So some English versions interpret the grammar to indicate that the terms modify each other rather than refer to three separate actions. For example:

> in patiently enduring the suffering that comes to those who belong to his Kingdom (GNT)

However, in some languages it is more natural to translate them as three separate actions. See examples in the Display.

**tribulation:** The word *tribulation* refers to the trouble and pain that people endure. Other ways to translate this word are:

> suffering (NIV)

> hardships (NJB)

> we(incl) all suffer troubles

**kingdom:** The word *kingdom* refers to God ruling over his people. John and his readers were companions in the *kingdom* because they all belonged to God’s kingdom. They all acknowledged God as their king, and they all lived under God’s rule. John and his readers shared in the blessings of the kingdom and its work.

In some languages it is necessary or more natural to add a verb here. For example:

> we (incl) all belong to God’s kingdom

> together we follow God as king

> all of us live under God’s rule

**perseverance:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *perseverance* refers to continuing to follow God even though facing hardships or opposition. Other ways to translate the Greek word are:

> patient endurance (NIV)

> patience to continue (NCV)

> we(incl) all patiently endure

> how we patiently endure difficulties/suffering/persecution

#### 1:9c

**that are in Jesus,**

* in Jesus,
* since we(incl) all follow Jesus together.

**that are in Jesus:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *that are in Jesus* probably applies to the whole phrase “your brother and partner in the tribulation and kingdom and perseverance” (1:9a–b). All those things are true or occur in a relationship with Jesus. John and his readers had a relationship with Jesus, so they suffered for the same reasons, shared in the kingdom of God, and patiently endured troubles for the same reasons.

Your translation of this phrase should refer to those shared experiences. Other ways to translate it are:

> as we (incl) are all in Jesus

> as we follow Jesus together

##### **General Comment on 1:9a–c**

In some languages it is more natural to put the phrase “in Jesus” in a different place. For example:

> 9aI John, your brother, who share with you 9cin Jesus 9bthe tribulation and the kingdom and the patient endurance (RSV)

> 9aI am John, your brother, and 9cas a follower of Jesus 9aI am your partner 9bin patiently enduring the suffering that comes to those who belong to his Kingdom (GNT)

#### 1:9d

**was on the island of Patmos**

* was put/exiled on the island called Patmos
* I was sent to Patmos Island

**was on the island of Patmos:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *was* can also be translated as “came to be.” John did not plan to be on Patmos. It happened because God planned it. The Greek grammar does not indicate whether or not John was still on Patmos when he wrote Revelation after receiving these visions.

1:9e probably implies that the Roman authorities exiled John to Patmos. So some English versions use a passive clause. The passive clause in English implies that John did not go to the island voluntarily. For example:

> I was sent to Patmos Island (CEV)

> I was put on the island of Patmos (GNT)

But the verb *was* probably indicates that, for this letter, it was not important to John whether or not he was exiled.

**the island of Patmos:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *of* is literally “being called.” It indicates that *Patmos* was the name of the island. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the island called Patmos (RSV)

> Patmos Island (CEV)

**island:** An *island* is land that is completely surrounded by water. Patmos is in the Aegean Sea. It is about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the mainland, which was the Roman province of Asia. Patmos is about 12 kilometers (8 miles) long from the northern end to the southern end. It is about 3 kilometers (2 miles) wide at its widest place.

#### 1:9e

**because of the word of God and my testimony about Jesus.**

* because of the word from God and the witness of/about Jesus.
* because I proclaimed the word from God and testified/witnessed about Jesus.

**because of the word of God and my testimony about Jesus:** This clause indicates that someone, probably Roman authorities, put John on Patmos (as punishment) *because* he preached *the word of God and my testimony about Jesus*. The Roman emperor insisted that everyone worship him as a god. Those who believed in Jesus refused to do that. The Roman authorities probably exiled John to Patmos because he was preaching about believing in Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord.Osborne (page 82\) says, “The context with Patmos here makes it more likely, however, that the two phrases speak of the reason John was exiled. Still, the meaning is similar to that of 1:2\. The two phrases mean that John was banished because of his preaching ‘the word of God’ and ‘witnessing for Jesus.’” Aune, Beale, Lenski, and Smalley also support this interpretation.

There is no subject or verb in this phrase. John was probably talking about himself and what he did. In some languages it is more natural to make the subject and verb/verbs explicit. For example:

> because I proclaimed the word of God and the testimony of Jesus

> because I had preached God’s word and the message about Jesus (NCV)

> because I had declared God’s word and told/testified about Jesus

**of the word of God and my testimony about Jesus:** Here the phrase refers to an earlier time when John was still in the province of Asia. John used the same phrase in 1:2 to connect to that verse, but he implies a connected\-but\-different meaning. Here it refers more generally to the Scriptures and the gospel about Jesus. John preached the gospel in Asia. Other ways to translate it are:

> of the Word of God and of witness to Jesus (NJB)

> for preaching the word of God and for my testimony about Jesus (NLT)

> of God’s word and the testimony about Jesus (GW)

**my testimony about Jesus:** In Greek this phrase is literally “the testimony of Jesus” (as in the ESV). The word “of” has several meanings. There are two ways to interpret this phrase:

1. The *testimony* is about Jesus. For example:

    > the testimony about Jesus (GW) *(BSB, NJB, NABRE, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, REB, NCV)*

2. Jesus gave the *testimony*. For example:

    > the truth that Jesus revealed (GNT) *(GNT)*

Many English versions translate this literally as “of.” It is not possible to tell which interpretation they follow. You may also translate this phrase so that it allows both interpretations. But some languages must choose one of the interpretations. If that is true in your language, follow interpretation (1\). Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> I…had told about Jesus (CEV)

> I had…borne witness to Jesus (JBP)

**testimony:** The word *testimony* means “the words spoken about what one saw or heard.” The word *testimony* is often used when the person speaking is expected to be truthful and accurate (as in a court of law). Other ways to translate this word are:

> witness (NJB)

> message of what they saw and heard

In this section, John told the seven churches that he was exiled on the island of Patmos because he had preached about Jesus. The people in the seven churches had also suffered for the sake of Jesus. So John indicated that they all shared in that suffering. He explained where he was and why he was there. He then began to tell his vision of Jesus and what Jesus revealed to him.

#### 1:10a

**On the Lord’s day I was in the Spirit,**

* I became inspired by the Spirit on the Lord’s day,
* On Sunday, the Lord’s day, I came under the Spirit’s power.
* On the day that we(incl) worship the Lord, I was well connected to the Holy Spirit.

**On the Lord’s day:** This phrase refers to the first day of the week, the day of worship for believers. Believers met on Sundays to worship because that was the day on which Jesus rose from the dead.

In some languages a literal translation would not refer to the weekly day of worship. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > On a Sunday the day for worshiping the Lord

    > On the day of the week that we worship the Lord

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. For example:

    > “The Lord’s Day” refers to the weekly worship day.

**I was in the Spirit:** In English Bibles, the titles and names of God begin with an uppercase (capital) letter. But ancient Greek writers used only one style of letters. So the Greek word that the BSB translates as *Spirit* can refer to either the human spirit or God’s Spirit. There are several ways to interpret it. The main interpretations are:

1. It indicates that John was connected to the Holy Spirit in some way that was different from the usual experience of the Holy Spirit. For example:

    > the Spirit came upon me (REB) *(BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NASB, GW, CEV, NET, REB, NCV, ESV, KJV)*

2. It indicates that John entered a trance\-like state and experienced things in his own spirit. For example:

    > I was in ecstasy (NJB) *(NJB, NRSV, NABRE)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).Beale (page 203\) says the text “uses the language of the prophet Ezekiel’s repeated rapture in the Spirit.” Kistemaker, Hughes, Mounce, Smalley, and Osbourne translate it as “in the Spirit.” Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> I came to be in the Spirit

> I came under the Spirit’s power (GW)

> I was in strong relationship with the Spirit

**I was:** The verb here is the same Greek verb as in 1:9d. In 1:9d John physically “came to be” on the island of Patmos. Here in 1:10a, he spiritually “came to be” in the Spirit. John did not plan to be in the Spirit. It happened because God made it happen.

The verb does not indicate or imply being forced. But the phrase “in the Spirit” implies that the Holy Spirit began a closer connection to John’s spirit. See examples above.

**in the Spirit:** As interpretation (1\) above indicates, John was connected to the Holy Spirit in a way that was different from the usual experience of the Holy Spirit. It does not say what circumstance John was in. It is not known if he was worshiping with others or worshiping on his own or praying or if he was in some other situation when John experienced the Holy Spirit in this way.

#### 1:10b

**and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet,**

* and I heard a loud voice speaking like a trumpet behind me,
* I heard a loud voice speaking behind me that sounded like a trumpet.

**a loud voice like a trumpet:** This phrase does not explain how the *loud voice* was *like a trumpet*. It may have been that it was loud and clear, like a trumpet call. If you need to say how it was *like a trumpet*, you may want to make that explicit. For example:

> a loud voice that sounded like a trumpet (CEV)

**a trumpet:** The word *trumpet* refers to a musical instrument that was often used to alert people to danger. It was also used to announce important messages. At that time trumpets were made from metal or from animal horns. A metal *trumpet* was a narrow tube probably about half a meter (18 inches) long. It had a mouthpiece at one end and a wide opening at the other end. People blew into it to produce a loud sound.

The particular kind of *trumpet* is not important here. In some languages people use trumpets made of animal horns, shells, bamboo, or other materials. If that is true in your language, you may want to use the word for that kind of trumpet here.

Some languages do not have a word for trumpet. If that is true in your language, you can:

* Use a word for another loud instrument, preferably one that someone blows into.
* Use a method of announcing in your area.
* Use the major language word.

#### 1:11a

**saying, “Write on a scroll what you see**

* and it said, “Write what you(sing) see on a scroll
* The voice said, “Write in a document/book what you see.

**saying:** There is a textual issue in 1:11a: (1\) The earliest Greek manuscripts have the word saying (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) One early Greek manuscript has the phrase saying, I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, and (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. This word introduces what the loud voice said. Translate it in a way that introduces what the voice said. For example:

> and it said

> It said

> The voice said

**Write on a scroll:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *scroll* refers to any kind of document. John probably wrote on a scroll. A *scroll* is a long piece of writing material.At that time people used parchment or papyrus rather than paper such as we use now. People made parchment from sheep or goat skins. People made papyrus paper from the stalks of the papyrus plant. After writing on it, it is rolled into a cylinder shape. To reach somewhere in the middle of the scroll, the loose end is also rolled, as in the drawing below. A scroll of perhaps five meters (sixteen feet) in length would be needed to write the Revelation.

Whether John used a scroll or a book is not important here. Some languages do not have a word for *scroll*. If that is true in your language, you may want to use the more general word “book” in this verse.

#### 1:11b

**and send it to the seven churches:**

* and send it to the seven churches
* Send it to the seven gatherings of believers

**send it to the seven churches:** The voice told John to send what he wrote to *the seven churches*.

**to the seven churches:** The word *churches* refers to groups of believers in different towns. See how you translated this phrase in 1:4\.

#### 1:11c

**to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.”**

* in Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.”
* that are in the cities/towns of Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.”

**Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea:** Each of these names is the name of a city. At that time there was probably only one gathering of believers in each of these cities.

#### 1:12a

**Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me.**

* ¶ I turned around to see who was speaking to me.
* ¶ I turned around to see whose voice it was,

**to see the voice that was speaking:** The phrase *the voice* represents the person who spoke to John. In some languages it is more natural to refer to that person here. For example:

> to see who was speaking (NJB)

> to see the person who spoke with that voice

#### 1:12b–13c

In these verses the lampstands, the long robe, and the sash may imply a situation similar to that of a Jewish priest leading worship at the temple. A priest wore a long robe and sash, and a lampstand stood in the temple. These things may also imply high status for Jesus. Your translation should allow for one or both implied meanings.

#### 1:12b

**And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands,**

* When I turned around, I saw seven gold lampstands.
* and then I saw seven lampstands made of gold,

**And having turned:** John already referred to the action of turning in 1:12a. So referring to it a second time here emphasizes that action and what John saw. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> And immediately upon turning

> And when I turned (NIV)

> and so/indeed

**golden:** The word *golden* indicates that the lampstands were made of gold. Gold is a rare metal of a somewhat yellow color. It was the most expensive metal at that time. It is naturally shiny and beautiful. Below is a picture of a gold coin made in the Roman era of Caesar Augustus (who was the Roman emperor when Jesus was born).

Some languages do not have a word for “gold.” If that is true in your language, you should use the word from the major language in your area. The people in your language may not be familiar with gold. If that is true in your language, you may want to include a footnote. For example:

> Gold is a rare metal of a somewhat yellow color. It was the most expensive metal at that time. It is naturally shiny and beautiful.

**lampstands:** A lampstand is a 1–2 meter (3–6 feet) tall rack or pillar for holding a lamp. It has a place for a lamp on its top. This context implies that there were lamps on the lampstands. There were many kinds and styles of lampstand. John did not say what kind of lampstand he saw. The drawing here only shows generally what lampstands look like.

A lamp in John’s time was a small clay or metal container in which people burned oil. The lamp was shaped to hold a wick on one side. The exact kind of lamp is not important here. So if you translate the term *lampstand* with a phrase that means “a holder for a lamp,” in that phrase you should use a word that refers generally to a lamp or light\-producing device. Some of the styles of lamps used in John’s time are shown below.

### Section 1:9–20: John introduced the revelation

So John indicated that they all shared in that suffering. He explained where he was and why he was there. He then began to tell his vision of Jesus and what Jesus revealed to him.

#### 1:13a

**and among the lampstands was One like the Son of Man,**

* In the midst of the lampstands was someone like a son of man,
* and a being like a man stood among them.

**among:** This word indicates that the lampstands were positioned on either side of Jesus. Some lampstands may have been in front of Jesus and some may have been behind him. It is implied that Jesus was standing. For example:

> standing in the middle/midst of

**One like the Son of Man:** The phrase *the Son of Man* is based on the Hebrew idiom that refers to someone who has the characteristics of a man. So here it means “a human being.” John probably implies a connection to Daniel 7:13\. There, Daniel saw someone who looked like a person (rather than an angel or other kind of being) coming on the clouds. Daniel said he was “like a son of man.” This phrase probably implies three things:

1. This person was the Christ. This whole phrase is similar to the phrase in Daniel 7:13. Many Jews in Jesus’ time understood that Daniel 7:13–14 described the Christ. John probably wanted to remind his readers of those verses in Daniel.Beale, page 210, Osbourne, page 87\.
2. This person was Jesus. The phrase *the Son of Man* is similar to the phrase “the Son of Man” that Jesus often used for himself.Swete, page 15, Lenski, page 64\.
3. This person looked like a human being. In Hebrew the phrase *Son of* means “someone having the characteristics of.” John saw a being who looked like a person, but with the differences described in 1:14–16.Translator’s Handbooks (on TW) mentions this option and the other two as well.

Some ways to translate this phrase are:

* Translate literally. You may want to translate literally if you translated “the Son of Man” literally in the Gospels. You may then want to explain the meaning of the phrase in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > The saying “someone like a son of man” would remind believers of those words in Daniel 7:13–14\. This saying would also remind them of Jesus’ title for himself: “the Son of Man.” *Keep the word Man general rather than referring to an unknown man; that is, do not say or imply “a son of* *a* *man” or “a son of* *the* *man.”*

**Note:** Some languages do not have the word “the” or “a,” but the meaning is understood from context. But without a “the” or “a,” there is no clear way to translate the difference between “the Son of Man” and “a son of man.” If that is true in your language, you should translate as indicated below.

* Translate according to meaning (c) above. Some examples are:

    > there was what looked like a human being (GNT)

    > a figure like a man (REB) *You may want to include a footnote to explain the literal words. An example footnote is:*

    > Literally: “someone like a son of man.” This saying would remind believers of those words in Daniel 7:13–14\. This saying would also remind them of Jesus’ title for himself: “the Son of Man.” But here John is only indicating that he saw someone who looked somewhat like a human being, and this person’s appearance in 1:13–16 and his words in 1:17–20 indicate that he is Jesus. *If you do not have “the” and “a” in your language, you may want a different footnote. For example:*

    > Literally: “someone like son of man.” This saying is a Hebrew idiom that means “someone who looks like a human being.” It would remind believers of those words in Daniel 7:13–14\. Jesus used these words as a title for himself: “the Son of Man.” But here John is only indicating that he saw someone who looked somewhat like a human being, and this person’s appearance in 1:13–16 and his words in 1:17–20 indicate that he is Jesus.

**Note:** You should not translate this phrase as “someone like the Son of Man.” Translating that way indicates that the person whom John saw was not Jesus but someone like him. But 1:18 shows that this phrase does refer to Jesus.

**like the Son of Man:** This phrase is a quote from Daniel 7:13\. If you usually footnote the location of quotes from the Old Testament, you may want to do so here.

#### 1:13b

**dressed in a long robe,**

* who wore a robe that went to his feet
* He was clothed in a full\-length robe

**dressed in:** This phrase indicates that Jesus was wearing the robe. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> clothed with (RSV)

> wearing (GNT)

**a long robe:** This phrase refers to a long loose garment which covers the body from the shoulders down to the feet. A robe also has loose sleeves covering the arms.

In some languages people are not familiar with robes. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > long flowing clothes

    > one\-piece full\-length clothes

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, you may want to explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > A robe is a long, loose garment which covers the body from the shoulders down to the feet. A robe also has loose sleeves covering the arms.

#### 1:13c

**with a golden sash around His chest.**

* and a gold cloth band around his chest.
* with a wide sash made of gold across his upper body.

**a golden sash around His chest:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *sash* refers to a wrapping that was usually worn around the waist. But the phrase *His chest* indicates that the *sash* went around Jesus’ body at chest height.

The sash was made of gold. It was probably a cloth made of gold thread. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> he wore a wide golden belt around his chest (NET)

> a gold band around his chest (GNT)

> a gold cloth was wrapped around his chest (CEV)

* The hair on his head was white like wool, indeed as white as snow,
* His hair was as white as wool, or as snow. (GNT)
* His hair was very, very white.

**white like wool, as white as snow:** Both of these phrases indicate that Jesus’ hair was very white. Both *wool* and *snow* are examples of very white things. The two phrases together emphasize the whiteness. For example:

> were as white as wool, even as white as snow (NET)

In some languages people are not familiar with either *wool* or *snow*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Translate the meaning without the similes. For example:

    > very, very white

* Use a substitute for the words *wool* and *snow*. Use something considered very white in your culture. For example:

    > white as bright clouds

    > The whiteness of his hair was like a broken waveTagbanwa Back Translation on TW. *You may then want to explain the literal words in a footnote. An example footnote is:*

    > Literally: “white like wool, as white as snow.” Wool and snow are examples of very white things.

* Use the major language words, if people are familiar with them. You may want to explain their use in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Wool and snow are examples of very white things.

**wool:** The word *wool* refers to the hair of sheep and some kinds of goats. Other ways to translate this word are:

> sheep hair

> very white animal hair

**snow:** The word *snow* refers to frozen ice crystals that fall from the clouds. Snow falls instead of rain when it is very cold. That is, it may precipitate in the form of snow when the air temperature is below freezing. Snow is white and fluffy; it is not clear like rain.

#### 1:14b

**and His eyes were like a blazing fire.**

* and his eyes were like a fiery flame. (NET)
* His eyes were as bright as flames.

**His eyes were like a blazing fire:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *blazing fire* is literally “a flame of fire” (as in the RSV). This simile probably refers to the brightness of his eyes. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> his eyes were like a fiery flame (NET)

> his eyes looked like flames of fire (CEV)

> his eyes were bright as flames

Translate in a way that does not imply that Jesus was angry or that he showed any other specific emotion.

**His feet were like polished bronze refined in a furnace,**

* His feet were like bronze that was refined in a furnace/oven,
* His feet were like purified bronze/copper/brass.

**His feet were like polished bronze refined in a furnace:** There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as *refined*:

1. The bronze, a kind of metal, was no longer hot, so the Greek word means “refined.” It indicates that the bronze was heated until melted. The impurities then floated to the top and were removed. The bronze was allowed to cool, and it returned to solid form again. The bronze was then pure and shiny. It was without impurities. For example:

    > His feet were like polished bronze refined in a furnace (BSB, NLT) *(BSB, RSV, GNT, NJB, NABRE, NLT, NET, REB, ESV)*

2. The bronze was still hot, so the word means “glowing.” Metals glow red when they are very hot. For example:

    > His feet were glowing like bronze being heated in a furnace (CEV) *(NIV, NASB, GW, CEV, NCV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because if the metal glowed red\-hot, John could not have seen what kind of metal it was.Beckwith (page 439\) says. “*as when refined*.” Hughes (on TW) says, “burnished brass.” Other ways to translate this word following interpretation (1\) are:

> His feet were like bronze purified in a furnace

> His feet were like bronze made pure in a furnace

**His feet were like polished bronze:** This clause indicates that *His feet* were similar in color to *polished bronze*. The clause may also imply strength or moral purity. The clause does not indicate that his feet were hard or unbending like metal.

**bronze:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *bronze* refers to a metal that is a mixture of copper and another metal, either tin (which makes *bronze*) or zinc (which makes brass). Bronze, as pictured below, is a brown metal color.

In some languages people are not familiar with *bronze* or brass. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the word in your translation. For example:

    > shiny brown/tan metal called bronze

* Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > shiny brown/tan metal

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, you may want to explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Bronze is a metal that is a mixture of copper and tin. It is a brown metal color.

**furnace:** This word refers to a kind of oven that can be heated so hot that it melts metal. Other ways to translate this word are:

> oven

> metal\- refinery

#### 1:15b

**and His voice was like the roar of many waters.**

* and his voice was like the roar of many waters. (NET)
* His voice sounded like a roaring/raging waterfall/cascade.

**His voice was like the roar of many waters:** This clause probably indicates that his voice was loud and powerful. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> his voice was like the roar of many waters (NET)

> his voice thundered like mighty ocean waves (NLT)

**the roar of many waters:** Here this phrase refers to a lot of water and to the sound that water makes when it is moving fast. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> raging waters (GW)

> the roar of many waterfalls

> flooding water (NCV)

**He held in His right hand seven stars,**

* He held seven stars in his right hand, (GNT)
* He had in his right hand seven stars. (KJV)

**He held in His right hand seven stars:** Here the phrase *He held in His right hand* implies that Jesus had authority or care over something.

**He held:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *held* also means “had.” Here the word indicates that Jesus in some way possessed or controlled the seven spirits and the seven stars. Translate using a word with that meaning. For example, the KJV says:

> He had

**stars:** This word is symbolic of the churches (1:20\). But you should use the normal word for *stars* here.

In some languages a literal translation would not communicate the meaning of these images. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain in a footnote. For example:

> This implies that Jesus had authority or care over the stars. The stars are symbolic of the churches.

**a sharp double\-edged sword came from His mouth:** Here the word *came* indicates that the handle of the sword was in his mouth and the blade of the sword extended forward from his mouth. The word here does not indicate that the sword was leaving his mouth. The NET translates this as:

> a sharp double\-edged sword extended out of his mouth

**double\-edged:** This word indicates that both edges of the blade of the sword were sharpened.

**sword:** A *sword* is a hand\-held weapon that is used to cut or stab. The swords of that time were 60–120 centimeters (2–4 feet) long and made of metal. The picture shows some of the various kinds of swords used at that time.

In some languages people are not familiar with swords. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Translate the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > long knife

    > cutting/sharp weapon

    > war machete/bush\-knife

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, you may want to explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > A sword is a hand\-held weapon that is used to cut or stab. The swords of that time were 60–120 centimeters long and made of metal.

#### 1:16c

**His face was like the sun shining at its brightest.**

* and his face was like the sun shining in full strength. (RSV)
* His face was shining brightly, like the sun shining with all its force/power.

**His face was like the sun shining at its brightest:** This clause indicates that his face was shining very brightly, just as the sun shines. Another way to translate is:

> His face was shining brightly like the sun shines in all its brilliance

**at its brightest:** The Greek phrase is literally “in its power.” This phrase refers to the sun shining very brightly, and it implies that no clouds block the sun’s light. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> in full strength (RSV)

> at its brightest time (NCV)

## Revelation 1:17 (id: 522671)

### Section 1:9–20: John introduced the revelation

In this section, John told the seven churches that he was exiled on the island of Patmos because he had preached about Jesus. The people in the seven churches had also suffered for the sake of Jesus. So John indicated that they all shared in that suffering. He explained where he was and why he was there. He then began to tell his vision of Jesus and what Jesus revealed to him.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> Preliminary vision (NJB)

> John told/described his first vision

> Introduction to what God revealed to John

#### 1:17a

**When I saw Him, I fell at His feet like a dead man.**

* ¶ When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though I had died.
* ¶ Immediately after seeing him, I collapsed at his feet like a dead man.

**When I saw Him:** The pronoun *Him* refers to Jesus here. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> Seeing him standing there

> Immediately upon seeing him

**I fell at His feet like a dead man:** This clause indicates that John fell immediately, like a person would fall if he died suddenly. He was overwhelmed by what he saw. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> I fell at his feet as if I were dead (NLT)

> I fell at his feet as though I were dead (REB)

#### 1:17b

**But He placed His right hand on me and said,**

* But he put his right hand on me and said,
* But he laid his right hand on me and said,

**But:** The Greek conjunction here is usually translated “and” (as in the NASB). But there is some contrast between John throwing himself down and Jesus having compassion. The BSB therefore translates this as: *But*.

You should connect 1:17a–b in the way that is most natural in your language.

**He placed His right hand on me:** This action shows compassion and reassures John. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> he laid his right hand upon me (RSV)

> he put his right hand on me (CEV)

#### 1:17c

**“Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last,**

* “Do not be afraid! I am the First and Last,
* “Do not be afraid! It is I, who was the First Being and Last Being.

**I am the First and the Last:** The title *the First and the Last* indicates that Jesus existed before all things and will exist after everything in this world ends. This title implies that he is therefore greater than anything and has authority over everything. This title is similar in meaning to the title “the Alpha and the Omega” (1:8a).

In some languages a literal translation would not have that meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. For example:

    > The title “the First and the Last” indicates that Jesus existed before history began and will exist after it ends. He is therefore in authority over human history.

* Explain the title in your translation. For example:

    > I am the First and the Last existing eternally

    > I am the One who is from the very beginning until the very end of time/history

Translate this title in a different way from the title “the Alpha and the Omega,” because both titles appear in 22:13\.

**the Living One.**

* and the Living One.
* I am the One who lives!

**the Living One:** The phrase *the Living One* is a second title. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> and the Living One

> and I am the One Who Lives

The title *the Living One* means “the one who lives.” Jesus used it as a title for himself.

#### 1:18b

**I was dead, and behold, now I am alive forever and ever!**

* I was dead, but look/listen, I am alive for all ages/time to come.
* Previously I was dead, but hey/wow, now I am alive for eternity!

**I was dead:** Here the past tense indicates that Jesus was dead in the past, but God caused him to live again. He was alive at the time he spoke to John.

In some languages it is more natural to include the implied information that Jesus was dead but now is no longer dead. For example:

> Previously I was dead

> I was dead before

**behold:** This word emphasizes or calls attention to the words that follow. Here it indicates that what Jesus was about to say is important. Sometimes *behold* is translated as “look.” However, here it is not a command to look at something.

If you have a word that emphasizes the words that follow, you may want to use it here. Some examples are:

> see (NRSV)

> indeed/hey

> look (NJB)

> listen

**forever and ever:** The Greek phrase is literally “into/unto the ages of the ages.” The phrase means “always” or “eternally.” Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> for evermore (RSV)

> for all ages to come

You should translate this phrase as you did in 1:6\.

#### 1:18c

**And I hold the keys of Death and of Hades.**

* I have the keys for/over death and Hades the place of the dead.
* I have authority over death and the world of the dead. (GNT)

**I hold the keys of:** The symbol of the *keys* indicates that Jesus had power and authority over death and Hades. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> I have the keys of (ESV)

> I have authority over (GNT)

**Hades:** The word *Hades* refers to the place where the spirits of dead people live before God judges everyone.

Some ways to translate *Hades* are:

* Use the name in your language for the place of the spirits of dead people.

Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

> the place of the dead (NCV)

> the land/world of the dead

* Use the Greek word and explain it in your translation. For example:

    > Hades, the place of the dead

* Use the Greek word and explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Hades is the place where the spirits of dead people live until God judges everyone.

Or see Hades in the KBT.

#### 1:19a–b

**write down the things you have seen, and the things that are, and the things that will happen after this:** There are two ways to interpret the connection between the phrase *the things you have seen*, the phrase *the things that are*, and the phrase *the things that will happen after this*:

1. The three phrases express three things that Jesus wanted John to write about. The three phrases poetically describe the whole revelation. For example:

    > what you have seen and what is and what will happen after these things (CEV) *(BSB, NIV, NRSV, NASB, NABRE, GW, CEV, NET, REB)*

2. The first phrase express the things that Jesus wanted John to write about. The last two phrases explain the first phrase. The first phrase refers generally to the whole revelation. For example:

    > the things you see, both the things that are now and the things that will happen afterward (GNT)

    > all that you see of present happenings and what is still to come (NJB) *(GNT, NJB, NLT, NCV, ESV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because a plain “and” occurs before the second phrase and before the third phrase.The Greek word *kai* “and” can also mean “even” (as in “that is”). But John has already seen things (1:10–18\), Jesus will tell him about seven churches as they were at that time (chapters 2–3\), and Jesus will tell him about future events (chapters 4–22\). So it seems best to understand *kai* as “and.” Beale (page 216\) calls it “The threefold object clause.” But if the major language version follows interpretation (2\), you may want to follow that.

#### 1:19a

**Therefore write down the things you have seen,**

* ¶ So write about the things/events that you(sing) have seen,
* ¶ Therefore write in a book all I show to you: what you have seen so far,

**the things you have seen:** This phrase refers to what John has already seen (1:10–18\). The phrase implies the things John has heard as well. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> whatever you saw

> the things you saw

> all that you have seen here

#### 1:19b

**and the things that are, and the things that will happen after this.**

* the things/events that are now, and the things/events that will happen after that.
* and what is happening now, and what will happen afterward.

**the things that are:** This phrase refers to the events currently happening and the prophecies to the churches (chapters 2 and 3\). Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the things that are now (GNT)

> present happenings (NJB)

**the things that will happen after this:** This phrase refers to the prophecies about the future (chapters 4 to 22\). Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the things that will happen afterward (GNT)

> what will happen after

#### 1:20a–d

**This is the mystery…: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches:** The word *This* and the colon (:) at the end of 1:20b indicate that 1:20c–d describes the mystery in 1:20a–b. Some other ways to indicate this connection are:

> 20a–bThis is the secret meaning of the seven stars you saw in my right hand, and of the seven gold lamps: 20c–dthe seven stars are the angels of the seven churches… (REB)

> 20a–b I will explain the mystery of the seven stars that you saw at my right side and the seven gold lampstands. 20c–d The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches… (CEV)

> 20a–b Here is the secret of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and the seven golden lampstands: 20c–d The seven lampstands are the seven churches… (NCV)

#### 1:20a

**This is the mystery of the seven stars you saw in My right hand**

* The hidden meaning of the seven stars that you(sing) saw in my right hand
* Here are the secret meanings about the seven stars that you see in my right hand

**mystery:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *mystery* refers to truth or knowledge that people have not discovered on their own. Someone else reveals it to them. John did not know the symbolic meaning of the seven stars and the seven lampstands, but Jesus told him in 1:20c–d. Other ways to translate this word are:

> the secret meaning (GNT)

> The hidden meaning (GW)

**of the seven stars:** Here the word *of* means “about” or “concerning.”

#### 1:20b

**and of the seven golden lampstands:**

* and the hidden meaning of the seven gold lampstands is this:
* and the seven lampstands made of gold:

**of the seven golden lampstands:** Here the word *of* means “about” or “concerning.”

#### 1:20c

**The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches,**

* The seven stars are the angels associated with the seven churches,
* The seven stars represent the seven angels/messengers, one for each of the seven gatherings of believers.

**The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches:** This clause indicates that each star represented an angel. There was one angel for each church. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> The seven stars represent the angels of the seven churches

> The seven stars represent seven angels, one for each of the seven churches

**the angels of the seven churches:** Each angel has some kind of relationship with a church.Some scholars see the Greek word that the BSB translates as *angel* as representing the spiritual dimension of the church or its spiritual life. But Johnson (page 430\) says this interpretation “lacks any supporting evidence in the NT…, especially…in Revelation.” It seems best to understand this word as an actual angel, like it is used in the rest of Revelation. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the angels belonging to the seven churchesA translation of this example must not imply that the church somehow “owns” the angel.

> the angels associated with the seven churches

**angels:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *angels* can also be translated as “messengers.” It refers here to spirit beings who serve God. The English versions usually translate the Greek word as *angels*. See how you translated this word in 1:1\.

#### 1:20d

**and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.**

* and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.
* The seven lampstands represent the seven gatherings of believers.

**and the seven lampstands are the seven churches:** This clause indicates that each lampstand represents a church. In some languages a literal translation will not have that meaning. If that is true in your language, translate the correct meaning. For example:

> the seven lampstands are symbolic of the seven churches

In this division, Jesus gave messages to John for seven churches. The churches were located in a province of the Roman empire that was called Asia. That region is now the southwest corner of the country of Turkey.

Each of these seven messages has an introduction, a main part, and a closing. The introductions describe Jesus with words similar to those found in chapter 1\. The main parts describe what the churches were doing right and what they were doing wrong. The closings encourage the believers to repent of their sins and persevere in following Jesus. The verses for each part are:

|  | Introduction | Main part | Closing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (1\) | 2:1a–c | 2:2a–6c | 2:7a–e |
| (2\) | 2:8a–c | 2:9a–10e | 2:11a–b |
| (3\) | 2:12a–b | 2:13a–16c | 2:17 |
| (4\) | 2:18a–d | 2:19a–25 | 2:26a–29 |
| (5\) | 3:1a–c | 3:1d–4b | 3:5a–6 |
| (6\) | 3:7a–d | 3:8a–11c | 3:12a–13 |
| (7\) | 3:14a–d | 3:15a–20c | 3:21a–22 |

In each message, Jesus spoke to the angel of the church. So he used singular verbs and pronouns. However, the angel represents the believers, and Jesus’ words refer to the deeds of the believers, not the deeds of the angel. So you may want to use plural verbs and pronouns in chapters 2–3 to refer to the believers.

## Revelation 2:1 (id: 522679)

### Section 2:1–7: Jesus spoke to the church at Ephesus

In this section, Jesus spoke to the people at Ephesus who believed in him. He said that they were doing some good things, but they were also doing a bad thing. He then encouraged them and warned them to repent. Lastly, he gave a promise to any believer who persevered in his faith.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

#### 2:1a

**“To the angel of the church in Ephesus write:**

* ¶ “Write to the angel of the church/congregation in Ephesus:
* ¶ “To the angel associated with the gathering of believers in Ephesus, write this:
* ¶ Jesus continued, “Write this message to the angel representing God’s people who are in the city of Ephesus:

Jesus continued the speech he began in 1:17\. Since people sometimes begin reading at the start of chapters, you may want to indicate who was speaking. For example:

> Jesus continued and said,

**To the angel of the church in Ephesus write:** Jesus told John to write *To the angel of the church in Ephesus*, but the message was for the believers in Ephesus. The angel had a relationship with those believers in some way (as the Notes in 1:20 talk about).

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that the message was only for the angel. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning of the word “of” in your translation. For example:

    > To the angel identified/associated with the church in Ephesus write:

    > To the angel representing the church in Ephesus write:

* Include a footnote to explain the relationship between the angel and the church. An example footnote is:

    > Jesus told John to write “to the angel of the church in Ephesus,” but the message was for the believers in Ephesus. The angel represented the believers in Ephesus. The deeds that Jesus spoke of in 2:2 are the deeds of the believers. The same is true for the messages to the other six churches.

**angel:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *angel* means “messenger.” It refers here to a spirit being who serves God. The English versions usually translate the Greek word as *angel*. See how you translated this word in 1:1 or 1:20\.

**church:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *church* refers generally to a gathering of people. Someone summoned the people for a particular purpose. Here, as almost always in the NT, it refers to groups of believers.

In the Bible this word never refers to church buildings. You also should not use a phrase that refers to separate groupings of churches where each group has its own name. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> congregation

> the believers who live

> the gathering of believers

See how you translated this word in 1:4\.

**Ephesus:** Ephesus was an important city, a center for trade and the pagan worship of the goddess Artemis. In some languages it is helpful to explain what Ephesus was. For example:

> the city of/called Ephesus

#### 2:1b–c

Some English versions use quotation marks at the beginning of 2:1b because it begins telling what John was told to write. For example:

> ‘The words of him… (RSV)

> “This is the message… (GNT)

Introduce what John was told to write in a natural way in your language.

**These are the words of Him who holds the seven stars in His right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands:** The Greek words are literally “The one holding seven stars in his right hand and walking among the seven golden lampstands says these things.” The Greek word for “these” refers to the words in 2:2–7\. The whole clause here is an introduction to 2:2–7\. Other ways to translate it are:

> This is the message from the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand and who walks among the seven gold lampstands (GNT)

> The message of him who is holding the seven stars in his right hand and walking among the seven golden lampstands is this:

Jesus spoke these words about himself. He continues to speak in 2:2, using the pronoun “I.” In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that Jesus was talking about someone else here. If that is true in your language, indicate that Jesus spoke about himself. For example:

> These are my words, and I hold the seven stars in my right hand and walk among the seven golden lampstands

#### 2:1b

**These are the words of Him who holds the seven stars in His right hand**

* This message is from the one holding the seven stars in his right hand
* Here is the message from me, the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand

**Him…His:** Jesus referred to himself here. In some languages it is more natural to use the pronouns “I” and “my.” For example:

> These are my words. I hold the seven stars in my right hand…

> I am the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand. I am the one who walks among the seven golden lampstands. My message is this:

#### 2:1c

**and walks among the seven golden lampstands.**

* and walking in the midst of the seven gold lampstands:
* and walks among the seven lampstands made of gold.

**walks among:** This phrase indicates that the lampstands were on either side of Jesus. Some of the lampstands may have been in front of Jesus, and some may have been behind him as well. See how you translated *among* in 1:13\.

**the seven golden lampstands:** A lampstand is a stand with a place/platform for a lamp on top. This context implies that there are lamps on the lampstands. See how you translated *the seven golden lampstands* in 1:12\.

##### **General Comment on 2:1b–c**

In some languages it is more natural to identify the speaker before introducing the message. If that is true in your language, you may want to reorder the information in 2:1b–c. For example:

> 1b–c I am the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands. My message is this:

#### 2:2a

**I know your deeds, your labor, and your perseverance.**

* I know your(sing/plur) activities/accomplishments, that is, your toil and your patience to endure.
* I know everything that you have done—the things that you have worked hard at and the way you have persevered in your faith.
* I know what you have done, namely, how hard you have worked and how you have endured suffering.

**I know your deeds, your labor, and your perseverance:** Jesus indicated here that he knew what the believers had been doing. He was aware of all that they had done.

**your deeds, your labor, and your perseverance:** Here the *deeds*, *labor*, and *perseverance* are all things that the believers in Ephesus did because they believed in Jesus. There are two ways to interpret the connection of *deeds* to *labor* and *perseverance*:

1. The words *labor* and *perseverance* indicate the kinds of *deeds*. For example:

    > what you have done—how hard you have worked and how you have endured (GW) *(RSV, GNT, GW, CEV, REB, ESV, NCV)*

2. The *deeds*, *labor*, and *perseverance* are three separate things in a list. For example:

    > your deeds and your toil and perseverance (NASB) *(BSB, NIV, NJB, NASB, NABRE, NET, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because *labor* and *perseverance* can be included in the more general word *deeds*.Also, the Greek text only has “your” twice, once for “deeds” and once for “hard work and perseverance.”

**your…your…your:** The pronouns are singular. They refer to the angel of the church as the representative of all the believers there. But it was the believers who had been working hard and persevering. So in many languages it is more natural to use plural pronouns here.

**deeds:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *deeds* means “actions” or “accomplishments.” Other ways to translate this word are:

> activities (NJB)

> the things that you have done

In some languages it is more natural to translate the word *deeds* with a verb. For example:

> I know what you have been doing

**labor:** This phrase refers to the great efforts that the Ephesian believers had made to follow Christ. It was difficult for them to live as believers, and they worked hard at doing what God wanted them to do. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> toil (RSV)

> the things that you have worked hard at

**perseverance:** This word refers to continuing to follow God even though there are hardships or people who oppose them. It is the same Greek word that the BSB translates as “perseverance” in 1:9b. Other ways to translate this word are:

> steadfast endurance (NET)

> how you…endure (REB)

> how patient you have been (GNT)

> how you have endured (CEV)

See how you translated the Greek word “perseverance” in 1:9\.

#### 2:2b

**I know that you cannot tolerate those who are evil,**

* I know that you cannot endure wicked people,
* I know that you do not accept evil people,
* I know that you reject/oppose evildoers,

**you cannot tolerate those who are evil:** This clause indicates that the believers at Ephesus did not accept those who are evil as fellow believers. They did not permit unbelievers to teach or have influence in the church. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> you cannot accept wicked men

> you reject wicked men

> you oppose wicked men

**those who are evil:** The word *evil* indicates that these people did bad things. For example:

> evil people (GNT)

#### 2:2c

**and you have tested and exposed as liars those who falsely claim to be apostles.**

* and that you(sing/plur) carefully questioned and observed those people who call themselves apostles even though they are not, and you saw/discovered that they are liars.
* and that you have checked the beliefs of people who falsely/wrongly claim to be special messengers from Jesus. You realized/understood that they were lying about being apostles.

**you have tested:** Here the word *tested* may indicate that:

1. The believers questioned these evil people who claimed to be apostles about their beliefs.
2. The believers observed them and compared their teachings and behavior to the teachings and behavior of Jesus.

The believers probably did both (a) and (b). Translate this in a way that allows for both meanings. For example:

> You have examined (NLT)

> you carefully questioned and observed

**exposed as liars:** This phrase refers to what the believers in Ephesus determined after testing the false teachers. The believers saw that these false teachers were not apostles. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> have discovered that they are liars (GW)

> saw/realized that they had lied

**those who falsely claim to be apostles:** These evil people came to the believers in Ephesus and lied to them saying, “We are apostles.” Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> those who call themselves apostles, and they are not (NASB)

> those who falsely say that they are apostles

**apostles:** In general, the Greek word that the BSB translates as *apostles* refers to those sent with a message. They are representatives or messengers of a higher authority. Here it refers to those sent to other cities with the gospel of Jesus (such as Barnabas and Saul in Acts 13:1–3\).

The false apostles to whom Jesus referred here also claimed to have authority from him for their false teachings.

Some ways to translate this word are:

* Translate the meaning. For example:

    > representatives

    > special messengers

    > sent\-people *If this word is too general, you may want to add the phrase “of Jesus Christ.” That phrase tells from whom they claimed to receive their authority. An example is:*

    > representatives of Jesus Christ

* Use the major language word if people are familiar with this word. You may want to explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > The word “apostles” refers to those sent to other places with the gospel of Jesus Christ. False apostles also claimed to have authority from Jesus for their false teachings, but they were lying.

This verse tells more of what Jesus Christ knew about the believers in Ephesus. You may want to use the same word or phrase here that you used at the beginning of 2:2a. For example:

> I know you are… (RSV)

**Without growing weary:** Here the phrase *Without growing weary* indicates that the believers did not become discouraged and stop doing what God wanted them to do. They did not stop believing in Jesus. They continued to follow him. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> did not tire of following me

> you have not given up (GNT)

#### 2:3b

**you have persevered and endured many things for the sake of My name.**

* you have persevered and endured troubles for my sake.
* you have continued to trust/follow me and patiently lived with difficulties because you trusted/followed me.,

**you have persevered:** The word *persevered* has the same meaning as the noun “perseverance” in 2:2a. It refers to continuing to follow Christ even though there are hardships or opposition. See how you translated the similar word “perseverance” in 2:2\.

**endured many things:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *endured many things* refers to experiencing troubles and difficulties. It is implied here that the believers in Ephesus have *endured many things* with a good attitude. Other ways to translate the Greek word are:

> have faced/experienced difficulties with a good attitude

> carried/endured troubles well

**for the sake of My name:** The *name* of Jesus is a figure of speech. It stands for who Jesus is. This phrase indicates that the believers in Ephesus persevered and endured because they followed Jesus. Doing this honored Jesus. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> for my sake (GNT)

> in my cause (REB)

> because you follow me

### Section 2:1–7: Jesus spoke to the church at Ephesus

In this section, Jesus spoke to the people at Ephesus who believed in him. He said that they were doing some good things, but they were also doing a bad thing. He then encouraged them and warned them to repent. Lastly, he gave a promise to any believer who persevered in his faith.

#### 2:4a

**But I have this against you:**

* ¶ But I have one complaint against you.
* ¶ But there is something I dislike/criticize about your way of life, namely,

**But I have this against you:** This clause indicates that Jesus was displeased with the believers about something. He explained what he was displeased about in 2:4b. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> But I have this complaint against you. (NLT)

> However, I find fault with you in this way:

> But I do have this one criticism of you.

#### 2:4b

**You have abandoned your first love.**

* You have left/abandoned your early/previous/former love.
* that you love much less now than you did at first.
* that you do not love me and each other at all like you did when you began to follow me.

**You have abandoned your first love:** The word *abandoned* means “left” or “forsook.” It indicates that the believers love much less now than they did earlier. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> you have abandoned the love you had at first (RSV)

> you love little compared to how you loved at first

> you have less love now than formerly (NJB)

John did not explicitly say whom the Ephesian believers now loved less. He was probably referring to their love in general, including love for God, for Jesus, and for fellow believers. If possible, do not say explicitly whom they loved less. However, some languages must say who was loved. If this is true in your language, you should add a general word or phrase. For example:

> you love everyone less

> You don’t love me or each other as you did at first! (NLT)

**first:** This word refers to the first time that the Ephesian believers began to follow Jesus. At that time they loved Jesus and one another very much, and they acted in ways that showed it.

**love:** The word *love* refers to a strong feeling of affection and concern for someone.

#### 2:5a

**Therefore, keep in mind how far you have fallen.**

* Remember from where you(sing/plur) have fallen,
* So remember how strongly/well you used to love. It was not like your weak love today/now.
* So remember that before/earlier you loved much, but today you love little.

**Therefore:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *Therefore* introduces the desired result of hearing the rebuke in 2:4\. The believers should remember and repent. Other ways to translate this word are:

> then (RSV)

> So (AB)

You should begin this verse in the way that is natural in your language.

**keep in mind:** This phrase refers to thinking again about something that is already known. Other ways to translate this word are:

> Think again about

> Do not forget

**how far you have fallen:** This is a figure of speech. The phrase *how far you have fallen* indicates that the believers no longer loved as much.

In some languages a literal translation would not have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Translate the correct meaning in your translation. For example:

    > how great the love was that you used to have

    > how greatly/warmly you used to love!

* Use a different idiom. For example:

    > how close you once were to God/me *You may then want to explain the literal words in a footnote. An example footnote is:*

    > Literally: “the height from which you have fallen.” This saying refers figuratively to the believers’ great love as a long distance above them. Earlier they loved more or “higher,” but now they love less or “lower.”

#### 2:5b

**Repent and perform the deeds you did at first.**

* repent, and do those things you first did.
* Stop doing that thing, change your thinking and act as you did when you first followed me!

2:5b tells another thing that the believers must do.

**Repent:** This word is a command to change one’s mind, heart, and actions. Jesus commanded the believers to change the way they thought and behaved. This command indicates that they were to repent of the falling away of which Jesus spoke in 2:5a. Other ways to translate this word are:

> Turn back to me (NLT)

> change your hearts and lives

> leave the ways of sin and follow the ways of God

**perform the deeds you did at first:** This clause refers to the things the believers did because of their great love when they first believed. Your translation should indicate or imply a connection from this clause to the phrase “first love” in 2:4b. In some languages it is more natural to include the implied information. For example:

> act as you used to when you first loved me

#### 2:5c

**But if you do not repent,**

* If you do not change/repent,
* If you do not stop sinning and follow the ways of God,

#### 2:5c–d

In 2:5c–d Jesus told them the consequences of not repenting. It is a threat to punish them if they do not repent. See also the General Comment at 2:5d.

#### 2:5d

**I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.**

* I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place before me.
* I will come to you, scatter you, and remove your lampstand from its place.

**I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place:** There is a textual issue in 2:5d: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the word come (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the words come quickly (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. Using the symbol of the lampstand, these words indicate that if the Ephesian believers do not repent, Jesus will cause their church to no longer exist. The believers would scatter, and none would meet in Ephesus.

In some languages people will not understand these words to have that meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

##### **General Comment on 2:5c–d**

* Translate literally and explain or suggest its meaning in your translation. For example:

    > I will come and remove your lampstand from its place among the churches (NLT)

    > I will come and end the church there by removing your lampstand from its place.

    > I will remove your lampstand. That is, I will remove your church.

* Translate literally and explain its symbolic meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > This saying indicates that Jesus will cause that church to no longer exist, either by scattering the believers or some other means.

The RSV follows the order of the Greek phrases quite literally here. It says:

> If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent. (RSV)

The phrase “If not” can also be translated as “If you do not do that.” The BSB combines the Greek phrases “if not” and “unless you repent.” The BSB also places them together at the beginning of the sentence. For example:

> But if you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.

Another way to order the phrases is to reverse 2:5d and 2:5c:

> 5dI will come to you and take your lamp stand from its place 5cif you don’t change. (GW)

#### 2:6a

**But you have this to your credit:**

* But you do have this,
* Yet a good thing you do to your credit is this:

**But you have this to your credit:** The Greek clause is literally “But you have this.” Here it introduces something good that the believers in Ephesus were doing. So the BSB and some English versions add the phrase *to your credit* or a similar phrase. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> Yet this you do have (NASB)

> But you have this in your favor: (NIV)

> But a good thing you have/do is this:

#### 2:6b

**You hate the works of the Nicolaitans,**

* you detest the ways of the Nicolaitans,
* You hate the evil/immoral deeds of the Nicolaitan group.

**hate:** The word *hate* indicates that the believers in Ephesus strongly disliked and avoided the practices of the Nicolaitans. Other ways to translate this word are:

> detest (REB)

> are angry with

**works of the Nicolaitans:** The word *works* refers to deeds that the *Nicolaitans* did because of the beliefs of their group. Very little is known about *the Nicolaitans* and what wrong beliefs they had. Perhaps they claimed to follow Jesus but also followed pagan practices and sexual immorality. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the deeds of the Nicolaitans (NASB)

> what the Nicolaitans do (GNT)

> the evil/immoral ways of the Nicolaitans

**the Nicolaitans:** The name *Nicolaitans* probably means “followers of Nicolaus.” However, it is not certain who this Nicolaus was. The English ending “–ans” means “the people of.” You should spell the name of the group as your language allows. For example:

> the people/followers of Nicolaus

> the Nicolait group

#### 2:6c

**which I also hate.**

* which I detest also.
* I also hate what they’re doing. (GW)

**which I also hate:** This clause indicates that Jesus also hated the practices of the Nicolaitans. Other ways to translate these words are:

> the way I do too

> as I hate what they do

This clause tells the reader more about the Nicolaitans. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other groups called Nicolaitans and Jesus only hated this group. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about the Nicolaitans. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> I also hate what they’re doing. (GW)

### Section 2:1–7: Jesus spoke to the church at Ephesus

In this section, Jesus spoke to the people at Ephesus who believed in him. He said that they were doing some good things, but they were also doing a bad thing. He then encouraged them and warned them to repent. Lastly, he gave a promise to any believer who persevered in his faith.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

#### 2:7a–b

**He who has an ear, let him hear:** This was probably a common saying or proverb in NT times. Similar sayings occur in Matthew 11:15, Mark 4:9, and Luke 8:8\. Here Jesus used this saying to urge or warn the believers to think carefully about what he had just said.

In some languages there is a similar saying/proverb urging people to listen carefully to what someone says. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use it here. For example:

    > Everyone must give their ears to me

* Explain this saying in a footnote using your saying. An example footnote is:

    > This means “give your ears to me.”

#### 2:7a

**He who has an ear,**

* If/since you(plur) have ears,
* Everyone who has ears that can hear
* Whoever is able to hear

**He who has an ear:** The phrase *He who has an ear* figuratively means “Anyone who can hear.” The word *ear* is a figure of speech representing the ability to hear. It also can refer to the ability to receive information any other way. Jesus was speaking to everyone who hears or receives what he just said in 2:1–6\. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> If you have ears (GNT)

> Every person who has ears (NCV)

> Anyone with ears to hear (NLT)

> Since you have received what I just said

> Can you hear?

#### 2:7b

**let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.**

* then hear the things that the Spirit is saying to the churches.
* should give careful attention to what the Holy Spirit says to the gatherings of believers.
* should understand and heed/obey what God’s Spirit says to the communities of God’s people.

**let him hear:** This command is addressed to everyone who hears or receives what he just said in 2:1–6\. It indicates that everyone should pay attention to his message. Other ways to translate it are:

> then listen

> do not ignore what you hear

> then you should pay attention to

**what the Spirit says to the churches:** This refers to everything Jesus said in 2:1–3:22\. It probably also refers to all of Revelation.

**the Spirit:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *the Spirit* refers to the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is God together with God the Father and God the Son. The Holy Spirit is *Spirit* in the sense that he is a living being who does not have a physical body. He is Holy in the sense that he is God. He is perfect in every way and is completely pure and sinless.

In some languages a literal translation would not clearly refer to the Holy Spirit. If this is true in your language, you may want to include the implied information in your translation. For example:

> Spirit/Breath of/from God

> Holy/Pure/Sacred Spirit

Do not imply that *the Spirit* is like the ghost of a dead person or that God has died.

**churches:** This word is plural. It indicates that believers everywhere are to understand and use the teachings in chapters 2–3\. See how you translated this word in 1:4\.

##### **General Comment on 2:7a–b**

2:7a–b is addressed to everyone who can hear. So in some languages it is more natural to use a pronoun other than the third person singular (“he”). These words may be the second person plural or singular (“you”), or the third person plural (“everyone”). For example:

> All you(plur) who have ears, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches!

> Everyone who has ears should listen to the things the Holy Spirit says to the churches!

> If you(sing) have ears, listen to what the Spirit says to these churches!

> Since everyone has ears, they must use them to listen and obey what the Spirit says to these churches!

> Do you(sing) have ears? Then listen to the words that the Holy Spirit says to the churches!

#### 2:7c

**To the one who overcomes,**

* To anyone who gains victory,
* To you(plur) who defeat/conquer everything that causes a believer to stumble,

**To the one who overcomes:** The phrase *To the one who overcomes* is emphasized by being first in the clause. If you have a natural way in your language to emphasize this phrase, you may want to do so. For example:

> To him who conquers, I will grant (RSV)

> To those who win the victory I will give (NCV)

In some languages it is not natural to have the phrase *To the one who overcomes* first in the clause. For example:

> I will give to him who overcomes

**To the one:** Here the word *one* refers generally to any believer who overcomes evil. Use a pronoun or grammar that is similar to what you used in the statement “He who has an ear” in 2:7a.

**overcomes:** This word means “triumphs” or “obtains/wins victory.” Here it refers to having success over sin, evil, and pressure to turn away from Jesus. Even though a believer is killed, he wins the victory over evil if he remains faithful to Jesus. He *overcomes* the power of sin and evil. Other ways to translate this word are:

> conquers (RSV)

> is victorious (NLT)

Some languages must say what a believer *overcomes*. If that is true in your language, you should refer generally to “evil” or “sin.” For example:

> defeat evil

> has victory over sin

#### 2:7d

**I will grant the right to eat from the tree of life**

* I will give permission to eat from the tree of life,
* I will give the privilege of eating the fruit of the tree that gives life.

**I will grant the right to eat:** The Greek clause is literally “I will give to eat.” The BSB translates “give” as *grant* and adds the phrase *the right* as one way to indicate the correct meaning of the Greek clause in English. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> I will give permission to eat (NRSV)

> I will let…eat (CEV)

**from the tree of life:** This phrase indicates that believers will eat the fruit of *the tree of life*. For example:

> the fruit of the tree of life (GNT)

**the tree of life:** This phrase indicates that *the tree* is the source of *life*. Those who eat the fruit will have eternal life. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the tree that gives life

> the life\-giving tree (CEV)

If you have translated Genesis 2:9, see how you translated this phrase there.

#### 2:7e

**in the Paradise of God.**

* which is in the good place of God.
* That tree is located in God’s perfect land/garden.

**in the Paradise of God:** This clause tells the reader more about the tree of life. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other trees of life and only this one is located *in the Paradise of God*. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about the tree of life. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> It is in the paradise of God.

**Paradise of God:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Paradise* can refer to an enclosed garden or park. It was also used to refer to a place where there are only good things, as in heaven (as in 2 Corinthians 12:2–3\). Here this word refers to the New Jerusalem, where there will be only good and perfect things. This paradise is *of God* because it belongs to God and he rules over it.

Some languages do not have a word to express this meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

##### **General Comment on 2:7c–e**

* Translate the meaning of *Paradise*. For example:

    > God’s good place

    > God’s land that is perfect

    > the garden of God (REB)

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, you may want to explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > The word “paradise” refers to a place where there are only good things. Here this word refers to the New Jerusalem (21:10, 22:2\).

In some languages it is more natural to tell what Jesus will give before telling to whom he will give it. For example:

> 7dI will give the privilege of eating from the tree of life, 7ewhich stands in the paradise of God, 7cto everyone who wins the victory. (GW)

#### 2:7c–e

**(reordered) I will give permission to eat from the tree of life, which is in the good place of God, to anyone who gains victory.**

* (reordered) I will give permission to eat the fruit of the tree that gives life to any of you(plur) who defeat/conquer everything that causes a believer to stumble. That tree is in God’s perfect land/garden.

### Section 2:8–11: Jesus spoke to the church at Smyrna

In this section, Jesus spoke to the people who believed in him at Smyrna. He saw that they were suffering and poor but strong in their faith. He saw that they were persecuted, and he encouraged them to continue following him. Lastly, he gave a promise for any believer who persevered in his faith.

#### 2:8a

**To the angel of the church in Smyrna write:**

* ¶ “Write to the angel of the church/congregation in Smyrna:
* ¶ “To the angel associated with the gathering of believers in Smyrna, write this:
* ¶ Jesus continued, “Write this message to the angel representing God’s people who are in the city of Smyrna:

**To the angel of the church in Smyrna write:** You should translate this introduction the same way you did in 2:1\. You only need to change the name to *Smyrna*. You probably will not need to repeat the footnote of 2:1a here.

#### 2:8b

**These are the words of the First and the Last,**

* This message is from the one who is the First and Last,
* Here is the message from me, who was the First Being and Last Being.

#### 2:8b–c

**These are the words of the First and the Last, who died and returned to life:** These words are an introduction to the words in 2:9–11\. You should translate the phrase *These are the words of* in a similar way to 2:1\. Some of those ways here are:

> This is the message from the one who is the first and the last, who died and lived again (GNT)

> The message of him who is the First and the Last, who died and came to life again, is this:

Jesus spoke these words about himself. He continues to speak in 2:9 with “I.” In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that Jesus was talking about someone else here. If that is true in your language, indicate that Jesus spoke about himself. For example:

> These are my words, and I am the First and the Last. I died and came to life again.

**the First and the Last:** The title *the First and the Last* indicates that Jesus existed before all things and will exist after everything in this world ends. This title implies that he is therefore greater than anyone or anything and has authority over everything. See how you translated this title in 1:17\.

#### 2:8c

**who died and returned to life.**

* who died and became alive again.
* I was previously dead but am now alive. I say this:

**who died and returned to life:** This clause further describes Jesus. He died on the cross and rose from the dead three days later. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> the one who died and lived again

> who died and lived again (GNT)

> who was dead but is now alive (NLT)

There are similar words at 1:18 (“I was dead, and behold, now I am alive”).

#### 2:9a

**I know your affliction and your poverty—**

* I know your(sing/plur) sufferings/troubles and that you are very poor,
* I know how much you suffer and I know how poor you are.

**I know your affliction:** There is a textual issue in 2:9a: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the phrase your afflictions (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the phrase your deeds and afflictions (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. The Greek word that the BSB translates as *affliction* means “oppression” or more generally “troubles.” Here the word probably refers to the fact that some people in Smyrna were persecuting the believers there. Other ways to translate this word are:

> I know your hardships (NJB)

> I know about your suffering (NLT)

> I know your troubles (NCV)

**your:** The pronoun *your* is singular in the Greek. It refers to the angel of the church as the representative of all the believers there. In many languages it is more natural to use plural pronouns here. See how you translated the pronoun “your” in 2:2\.

**your poverty:** The word *poverty* indicates that the believers in Smyrna were very poor. They had very little money or goods. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> you are poor (GNT)

> you are extremely/very poor

#### 2:9b

**though you are rich!**

* but you are wealthy!
* Yet you are spiritually rich because of your great faith!

**though you are rich:** Here the word *rich* refers to having many spiritual blessings. The believers could look forward to these rewards in heaven. In the Gospels these rewards are often called “treasure.”

The word *rich* here does not refer to earthly riches. Jesus used the word *rich* without explanation to contrast it with the word “poverty” in 2:9a.

In some languages a literal translation would only refer to earthly riches. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > yet you are rich in heaven/spirit

    > yet you are spiritually rich

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. For example:

    > This saying indicates that the believers were rich in heavenly treasures/blessings. They were rich in heaven because of their great faith in God.

#### 2:9c

**And I am aware of the slander of those who falsely claim to be Jews,**

* I know the lies told about you by those who falsely claim to be Jews
* I know the hurtful/damaging lies that some people have said about you.(sing/plur) They say that they are Jews following God,

**slander:** This word refers to lies told for the purpose of hurting someone’s reputation, name, or status. Some people in Smyrna were telling lies to cause others to think that the believers were bad people. In some languages it is necessary or more natural to translate this word using a verb or verb phrase. For example:

> lies being told about you

> the evil things said against you (GNT)

> the bad things some people say about you (NCV)

> some people are slandering you

> you are slandered (REB)

#### 2:9c–d

**those who falsely claim to be Jews, but are in fact a synagogue of Satan:** The people referred to here were probably Jews by birth, but they did not believe in Jesus. Satan had influenced them so that they persecuted the believers at Smyrna. So in that way they were not Jews spiritually, because true Jews followed God’s commands. Jesus said that they were *a synagogue of Satan*.

Jesus used this strong language to emphasize that these people were very wrong to follow Satan. Other ways to translate these words are:

> people who falsely claim to be Jews but are really members of the synagogue of Satan (NJB)

> those who claim to be Jews but are not; they are a group that belongs to Satan (GNT)

> They say they are Jews, but they are not true Jews. They are a synagogue that belongs to Satan. (NCV)

#### 2:9d

**but are in fact a synagogue of Satan.**

* but are really a group/synagogue that follows Satan.
* but they are actually a group that belongs to Satan.

**synagogue:** Here the word *synagogue* refers to the group of misled Jews in Smyrna. The word does not refer to the building where they met. The GNT therefore translates this as:

> group

**Satan:** The word *Satan* is the Hebrew word used for the leader of all evil spirits. In Hebrew the word means “one who opposes others.” It is similar in meaning to “enemy” but does not necessarily imply hostility or hatred. It is used as a title in the New Testament. So you should spell this word in your language like the Greek or the major language word. If this word is not already known in your area, you may also want to add a descriptive phrase. For example:

> Satan, the one who opposes,

> Satan, the one who stands against God

If you have translated the Gospels, see how you translated this word in Matthew 4:10, Mark 1:13, Luke 10:18, or John 13:27\.

**Do not fear what you are about to suffer.**

* Do not be afraid of the sufferings that you(sing/plur) are about to experience/endure.
* You are about to suffer, but you should not be afraid.

**Do not fear what you are about to suffer:** This clause functions in two ways:

1. as a prophecy that the believers at Smyrna will soon suffer for the sake of Jesus,
2. as an encouragement to not be afraid of that suffering.

Other ways to translate this clause are:

> Do not be afraid of the sufferings that are coming to you (NJB)

> You are about to suffer, but do not be afraid of that.

#### 2:10b

**Look, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison to test you,**

* Look, the Devil/Slanderer will put some of you(plur) in jail to test your faith,
* Listen/Hey! The Demon Chief will cause unbelievers to put some of you in prison to see whether you truly believe in me or not.

**Look:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Look*. The word emphasizes or calls attention to the words that follow.

If you have a word with that meaning, you may want to use it here. Some examples are:

> Behold, (NASB)

> Beware, (NRSV)

> Listen/Hey!

**the devil:** The Greek word that that the BSB translates as *devil* means “slanderer.” A slanderer is someone who says false things about someone to try to ruin that person’s reputation, name, or status. This word is used like a title for the leader of demons, Satan. Make it clear that this word is used like a title:

> Devil (GNT)

Some ways to translate this word are:

* Use a local name or idiom that refers to the chief of all demons. *You may want to explain the meaning of the Greek word in a footnote. An example footnote is:*

    > Literally:“slanderer.” In Greek this was used as a title for the chief of all demons.

* Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > leader of the evil spirits

    > spirit enemy of God *You may want to explain the meaning of the Greek word in a footnote. An example footnote is:*

    > Literally: “slanderer.” In Greek this was used as a title for the chief of all demons.

* Translate its meaning. For example:

    > Slanderer *You may then want to explain this title in a footnote. An example footnote is:*

    > The title “Slanderer” refers to the chief of demons.

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, you may want to explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > The word “Devil” means “slanderer” in Greek.

**is about to throw some of you into prison:** This clause indicates that Satan would influence others to put some believers in prison. Satan would not physically put the believers in prison himself.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that Satan would physically put them there himself. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain the correct meaning in your translation. For example:

> will cause others to put some of you in prison

**prison:** This word refers to a place where people are locked inside so they cannot leave. Another way to translate this word is:

> jail (CEV)

**to test you:** Here the word *test* refers to examining someone’s faith to see if it is strong. The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *to test you* is literally “that you may be tested.” It is a passive clause. It does not say who would *test* the believers. In one sense, Satan would test the believers by tempting them to give up their faith. But in another sense, God was testing them to see if they believed strongly in him. Many English versions leave the subject ambiguous. For example:

> and you will be tested (CEV)

> so that you will experience/undergo testing

> where your faith will be tested (JBP)

> so that it will become clear if you believe well/truly or not

#### 2:10c

**and you will suffer tribulation for ten days.**

* and you will suffer hardship for ten days.
* For ten days you will experience trouble/oppression.

**suffer tribulation:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *suffer* is literally “have.” The Greek word that the BSB translates as *tribulation* refers to “oppression” or more generally “troubles.” Here it probably refers to the suffering and testing of 2:10a–b. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> have tribulation (RSV)

> face hardship (NJB)

> experience suffering (NET)

> suffer (NCV)

#### 2:10d

**Be faithful even unto death,**

* Be faithful, even if you must die because of that,
* Continue to obey and trust me, even if others kill you for believing in me,

**Be faithful:** This is a command to continue to follow Jesus Christ and to do what he says to do. In some languages it is more natural to say to whom the believers in Smyrna should be loyal. For example:

> Be faithful to me (GNT)

**even unto death:** This phrase indicates that the believers must continue to follow Jesus even if others kill them because of it. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> Even if you have to die (NJB)

> even though that might cause your death

> even if others kill you for believing/following me

#### 2:10e

**and I will give you the crown of life.**

* and I will give to you the crown that is life itself.
* and I will give you the wreath of victory, which represents eternal life.

**the crown of life:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *crown* is literally “wreath.” Here it means “reward.” This metaphor indicates that God will reward believers with eternal life. They will live forever with him.

In ancient times, athletes who won a contest received a wreath of leaves to wear on their heads as a sign of victory. This was a great honor, and it was their reward for winning the contest.

In a similar way, God will honor those who are victorious by giving them eternal life. The BSB has translated the word meaning “wreath” as *crown* because in English a *crown* is more easily understood to be a symbol for victory.

Some ways to translate this phrase are:

* Translate literally and explain it in your translation. For example:

    > the crown that is life itself (NET)

    > the wreath of victory, which represents eternal life

* Use a metaphor which uses an object that is a sign of victory in your culture. For example:

    > badge/trophy of life *You may then want to explain the Greek phrase in a footnote. For example:*

    > Literally:“crown/wreath of life.”

* Translate the meaning without the metaphor. For example:

    > the reward of eternal life for your victory

    > life as your prize of victory (GNT)

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. For example:

    > “The crown/wreath of life” indicates that the believer who remains faithful to Jesus will be rewarded with eternal life. The crown/wreath is a symbol of that victory for remaining faithful.

### Section 2:8–11: Jesus spoke to the church at Smyrna

In this section, Jesus spoke to the people who believed in him at Smyrna. He saw that they were suffering and poor but strong in their faith. He saw that they were persecuted, and he encouraged them to continue following him. Lastly, he gave a promise for any believer who persevered in his faith.

#### 2:11a

**He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.**

* ¶ If/since you(plur) have ears, then hear the things that the Spirit is saying to the churches.
* ¶ Everyone who has ears that can hear should give careful attention to what the Holy Spirit says to the gatherings of believers.
* ¶ Whoever is able to hear should understand and heed/obey what God’s Spirit says to the communities of God’s people.

**He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches:** Translate this saying as you did in 2:7\.

#### 2:11b

**The one who overcomes will not be harmed by the second death.**

* Anyone who gains victory will not be harmed in any way by the second death.
* You(plur) who defeat/conquer everything that causes a believer to stumble will not die the second time.

**The one who overcomes will not be harmed by the second death:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> the second death will not be able to hurt/harm those who overcome

**The one who overcomes:** The phrase *The one who overcomes* is emphasized in the Greek by being first in the clause. If you have a natural way in your language to emphasize this phrase, you may want to do so. For example:

> As for he who conquers, he

> Regarding those who win the victory, they

**overcomes:** The word *overcomes* means “triumphs” or “obtains/wins victory.” Here the word refers to having success over sin, evil, and pressure to turn away from Jesus. He continues believing and following Jesus even though he might be killed for it. See how you translated a similar phrase (“To the one who overcomes”) in 2:7\.

**not be harmed by the second death:** This is a figure of speech that indicates that believers will not die the second death. In some languages it is not natural to say that death can *harm* or hurt someone. Instead, it is more natural to:

* Use a different word. For example:

    > not be touched by the second death

    > not be affected by the second death

* Translate the noun *death* as a verb. For example:

    > not die the second time

**the second death:** This phrase refers to God punishing people forever after they have died physically. The first death is physical death. The second death is being thrown into the lake of fire (20:10, 14–15\).

In some languages people will not understand the figurative meaning of the phrase *the second death*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain its meaning in your translation. For example:

    > the second death, namely, eternal punishment

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > “The second death” refers to being thrown into the lake of fire (20:10,14–15\).

**second:** The word *second* refers to an item in a list that is counted as two, which is after the item counted as one. Some languages use a phrase for the meaning of the word *second*. Other ways to translate this word are:

> the one after the first

> the other

> the next one

### Section 2:12–17: Jesus spoke to the church at Pergamum

In this section, Jesus spoke to the people who believed in him at Pergamum. He saw that they had remained faithful to him despite opposition and persecution. But he warned them not to allow people believing in false teachings to remain in the church. He warned them to repent. Lastly, he gave a promise for any believer who persevered in his faith.

**To the angel of the church in Pergamum write:**

* ¶ “Write to the angel of the church/congregation in Pergamum:
* ¶ “To the angel associated with the gathering of believers in Pergamum, write this:
* ¶ Jesus continued, “Write this message to the angel representing God’s people who are in the city of Pergamum:

**To the angel of the church in Pergamum write:** You should translate this introduction the same way you did in 2:8\. You only need to change the name to *Pergamum*.

#### 2:12b

**These are the words of the One who holds the sharp, double\-edged sword.**

* This message is from the one who has the sharp, two\-edged war machete.
* Here is the message from me, the one with the sharp, double\-edged fighting knife.

**These are the words of the One who holds the sharp, double\-edged sword:** This clause is an introduction to the words in 2:13–17\. Translate the phrase *These are the words* in a way that is similar to 2:1\. Some of those ways are:

> This is the message from the one who has the sharp, two\-edged sword (GNT)

> The message of him who has the sharp, double\-edged sword is this:

Jesus spoke these words about himself. He continues to speak in 2:13a with “I.” In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that Jesus was talking about someone else here. If that is true in your language, indicate that Jesus spoke about himself. For example:

> These are my words, and I have the sharp, double\-edged sword.

**the One:** See how you translated the similar phrase “He who holds” in 2:1\.

**who holds the sharp, double\-edged sword:** The clause here uses the verb *holds* instead of the verb that means “extend out of” used in 1:16b. The rest of the clause is similar to the clause in 1:16b. Translate it in a similar way so that your readers will know that this clause refers to the same person.

#### 2:13a

**I know where you live, where the throne of Satan sits.**

* I know where you(sing/plur) live, namely, a place where Satan has his throne.
* I know that you live in a city where Satan rules the people,
* I know the kind of place you live in, and how Satan has great power/control over the people there.

**I know where you live:** There is a textual issue in 2:13a: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the phrase know where you live (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the words know your deeds and where you live (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. Jesus indicated here that he knew the sort of place that Pergamum was. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> I know that you live in the city where… (NLT)

> I know where you live. It is where… (NCV)

> I realize/understand where you live, namely, where…

**you:** The pronoun *you* refers to the angel of this church as the representative of the believers there. In some languages it is more natural to use plural pronouns here. See how you translated the pronoun “your” in 2:2 or 2:9\.

**where the throne of Satan sits:** This clause figuratively indicates that Satan ruled in Pergamum. The people of Pergamum did not directly follow Satan but followed other religions. They worshiped pagan gods and also the Roman emperor, Caesar. In that way they were in fact worshiping Satan and letting Satan rule their lives. Other ways to translate this are:

> where Satan is enthroned (NJB)

> where the throne of Satan is

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that Satan physically sat in Pergamum. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > where Satan rules the people

    > where the people are under the control of Satan *You may then want to include a footnote to indicate what the literal words say. An example footnote is:*

    > Literally:“where Satan has his throne.”

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. For example:

    > This saying represents the idea that Satan ruled over the people in that area.

**throne:** A *throne* is the official chair of a king. It is a symbol of his power to rule. See how you translated *throne* in 1:4\.

#### 2:13b

**Yet you have held fast to My name**

* Yet you continue to hold fast/tightly to my name/cause.
* yet you have remained loyal to me. (NLT)
* In spite of this, you have stayed faithful to me.

**Yet:** The Greek conjunction here is usually translated as “and” (as in the NJB). The GNT has no conjunction here. But there is some contrast between Satan having much authority in Pergamum and the believers continuing to be faithful to Jesus. So the NCV translates this conjunction as:

> But

You should connect 2:13a and 2:13b in the way that is most natural in your language.

**you have held fast to My name:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *held fast* literally refers to holding something. This clause indicates that the believers in Pergamum continued to be faithful to Jesus. They did not stop following him. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> you continue to cling to my name (NET)

> you have remained loyal to me (NLT)

#### 2:13c

**and have not denied your faith in Me,**

* You did not deny/disavow your faith in me,
* You did not say to anyone that you would no longer believe in me,

**and have not denied your faith in Me:** The word *denied* refers to disowning something or refusing to have anything to do with it. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> You did not renounce your faith in me (NIV)

> you did not abandon your faith in me (GNT)

> You did not say that you would no longer believe in me

**your faith in Me:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *your faith in Me* is literally “the faith of me.” Here it refers to the believers’ faith in Jesus Christ. They believed him, trusted him, and were committed to following him. Another way to translate this phrase is:

> you believe in me

#### 2:13d

**even in the day when My faithful witness Antipas**

* even during the time of my faithful witness Antipas,
* even in those earlier days when Antipas faithfully proclaimed my message.

**even in the day when My faithful witness Antipas:** Here the word *even* implies that persecution of believers during the life of Antipas was worse than at other times. At that time people persecuted the believers very much. However, the believers did not stop believing in Jesus.

**in the day when:** This phrase refers to the general time that Antipas was killed. It could refer to weeks or months before or after that time. For example:

> during the time (GNT)

**My faithful witness:** The Greek words here are literally “my witness, my faithful one” (as in the RSV). Antipas told others about Jesus as the Christ. He was faithful to Jesus when people persecuted him. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> who proclaimed my message and was faithful to me

> who told others about me and remained loyal to me

**Antipas:** Nothing else is known about this man named *Antipas*. He is mentioned only in this verse. He was not the same person as the *Antipas* mentioned in the Gospels.

#### 2:13e

**was killed among you, where Satan dwells.**

* who was killed in your city, namely, where Satan lives.
* They/People killed him in your city where Satan influences many people.

**was killed among you:** The phrase *was killed* is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. These verses do not say who killed Antipas, so you should use a general word. For example:

> whom they killed

> whom people killed

This clause tells the reader more about Antipas. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that John was thinking of several men named Antipas and only this one *was killed among you*. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about Antipas. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> He was killed.

**where Satan dwells:** This clause has a similar meaning to “where the throne of Satan sits” in 2:13a. It indicates that Satan had much influence in Pergamum.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that Satan physically dwelt in Pergamum. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:

    > where Satan influences/controls the people

    > where Satan has many people on his side *You may then want to include a footnote to indicate what the literal words say. An example footnote is:*

    > Literally: “where Satan lives.”

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. For example:

    > This saying is symbolic. It indicates that Satan influenced the people in that area.

#### 2:14a

**But I have a few things against you,**

* ¶ But I find fault with some things that you do.
* ¶ However, you do some things that I dislike,

**But:** Here the word *But* introduces Jesus’ criticisms of the believers in Pergamum:

> Nevertheless (NIV)

**I have a few things against you:** This statement indicates that Jesus did not like some things that the believers in Pergamum did. Other ways to translate this are:

> I have a few complaints against you. (NLT)

> You do some things that I do not condone.

> I find fault with some things that you do.

#### 2:14b

**because some of you hold to the teaching of Balaam,**

* For instance, some people among you follow the teaching of Balaam,
* namely, that some of you believe the teaching of the false/evil prophet Balaam.

**because some of you hold to the teaching of Balaam:** This indicates that some of the people in the church in Pergamum *hold to the teaching of Balaam*, as explained in 2:14c–e. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> there are some among you who follow the teaching of Balaam (GNT)

> some of you are followers of Balaam (NJB)

**the teaching of Balaam:** The phrase *the teaching of Balaam* means “what Balaam taught.”

**Balaam:** *Balaam* was a prophet mentioned in the Old Testament (Numbers 22–24; 31:8\). He was not an Israelite. He tried to curse the Israelites in order to get money. He also encouraged the Israelites to worship false gods. You may want to:

* Explain who *Balaam* was in your translation. For example:

    > the false/evil prophet Balaam

* Explain who *Balaam* was in a footnote. For example:

    > Balaam was a greedy false prophet.

#### 2:14c

**who taught Balak to place a stumbling block before the Israelites**

* who taught Balak to set a trap for the Israelites to cause them to sin
* He taught Balak how to tempt the people of Israel into sin

**who taught Balak:** This clause tells the reader more about Balaam. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that John was thinking of other men named Balaam and only this one *taught Balak*. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about Balaam. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> He taught Balak…

**Balak:** *Balak* was the king of Moab during the time when Balaam was a false prophet. At this time, the people of Israel had left Egypt and were traveling to the land that God had promised them. *Balak* was afraid that the Israelites would destroy him and his people. So he offered Balaam money to go and curse the Israelites. He also tempted the Israelites to worship false gods. You may want to:

* Explain who *Balak* was in your translation. For example:

    > Balak the king of Moab

* Explain who *Balak* was in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Balak was the king of Moab during the time of Balaam. At this time, the Israelites had left Egypt and were traveling to the land that God had promised them. Balak was afraid that the Israelites would destroy him and his people, so he tried to destroy the Israelites.

**to place a stumbling block before the Israelites:** The Greek words here are literally “put a trap/snare before the sons of Israel.” This clause indicates that Balak encouraged the people of Israel to sin. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> set a trap for the Israelites (NJB)

> lead the people of Israel into sin (GNT)

> tempt the people of Israel into sin

The two ways Balak enticed the Israelites to sin are listed in 2:14d–e.

#### 2:14d

**so they would eat food sacrificed to idols**

* by eating food that had been offered to idols
* by eating food earlier used to honor idols

**they would eat food sacrificed to idols:** This clause refers to attending a feast dedicated to an idol. The food was presented to the idol in order to honor the god represented by that idol. Later the people ate the food. The Israelites attended such a feast, honoring a false god instead of the true God. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> eat food that had been offered to idols (GNT)

> join in eating what had been used to honor idols

**idols:** An *idol* is a statue or other physical representation of a god. People worship the *idol*.

#### 2:14e

**and commit sexual immorality.**

* and by committing sexual sin. (NLT)
* and by doing wrong with someone who was not their spouse.

**commit sexual immorality:** This clause refers to sexual immorality of all kinds. It refers to having sexual relations with someone who is not your spouse. It does not imply that either person was married.

In your culture, you may use a euphemism for this meaning. For example:

> sleep/lie with someone who was not their spouse

> do wrong with someone who was not their spouse

The clause you use should be acceptable for reading aloud in public.

**In the same way, some of you also hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.**

* In the same way, some people among you follow the teaching of the Nicolaitans as well.
* And there are also others of you who are followers of the Nicolaitans.

**In the same way:** The people obeying the teaching of the Nicolaitans sinned in ways similar to the sinful ways of those obeying the teaching of Balaam (2:14b).Smalley (page 69\) translates the Greek word as “similarly.” Beale (page 251\) calls the Nicolaitans “another group…that was teaching the same thing as the Balaam (group).” For example:

> Likewise (NIV)

> In a similar way (NLT)

**some of you also hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans:** There is a textual issue in 2:15: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the word Nicolaitans (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) One early Greek manuscript have the words Nicolaitans which I hate (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it.

#### 2:16b

**Otherwise I will come to you shortly**

* But if you do not repent, I will come to you soon
* or I will come to/against you quickly

**Otherwise:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *Otherwise* is literally “But if not.” It introduces what will happen to those holding to the teachings of Balaam and the Nicolaitans if they do not repent. Other ways to translate the Greek phrase are:

> If not, (RSV)

> or (NJB)

> But if you do not repent

**I will come to you shortly:** Christ indicated here that he would come for the purpose of fighting against the sinners in the church in Pergamum (2:16c). This purpose is not in regard to gathering all believers. In other words, this action does not refer to the second coming of Jesus.

#### 2:16c

**and wage war against them with the sword of My mouth.**

* and fight a war against those people with the war machete of my mouth.
* in order to make war against them with the fighting knife from my mouth.

**wage war against them with the sword of My mouth:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *wage war* means “make war” (as in the NRSV). Other ways to translate this word are:

> fight a war against them with the sword of my mouth

> war against them with the sword of my mouth

If this group in the church was sinning believers, then these words refer to severe discipline. If this group was Nicolaitans pretending to be believers, then these words may refer to judging them worthy of death. Translate these words so that they allow either interpretation.

**them:** This pronoun refers to those people in the church who follow the false teachings of Balaam and the Nicolaitans.

**with the sword of My mouth:** This phrase refers to the *sword* also mentioned in 1:16b and 2:12b. The sword is *of* Jesus’ mouth because it came out from Jesus’ mouth.

* ¶ If/since you(plur) have ears, then hear the things that the Spirit is saying to the churches.
* ¶ Everyone who has ears that can hear should give careful attention to what the Holy Spirit says to the gatherings of believers.
* ¶ Whoever is able to hear should understand and heed/obey what God’s Spirit says to the communities of God’s people.

**He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches:** Translate this statement as you did in 2:11\.

#### 2:17b

**To the one who overcomes, I will give the hidden manna.**

* To anyone who gains victory, I will give some of the manna that has been hidden in heaven.
* I will give some of the heavenly food named manna, which is in a hidden place, to you(plur) who gain victory.
* If/When you(plur) defeat/conquer everything that causes a believer to stumble, I will give some of the heavenly food named manna, which is in a secret place, to you.

**To the one who overcomes:** The clause *To the one who overcomes* is emphasized by being placed first in the sentence. If you have a natural way in your language to emphasize this clause, you may want to do so. See how you translated it in 2:7\.

**overcomes:** The word *overcomes* means “triumphs” or “obtains/wins the victory.” Here the word refers to having success over sin, evil, and pressure to turn away from Jesus. Translate this phrase as you did in 2:7\.

**I will give the hidden manna:** This is a figurative way to say that Jesus will give a spiritual blessing to the people who overcome. This spiritual blessing is probably having fellowship with him at the end of the age.

Manna is food, so it is implied that the people who overcome would eat it. In some languages it is more natural to include this implied information. For example:

> I will give some of the hidden manna to eat

**the hidden manna:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *hidden* refers to something that someone has concealed or put in a secret place. Jesus did not say who had *hidden* this manna. Probably God hid it or allowed it to remain hidden.

This word implies that no one else knows where it is. Therefore, it will be ready for Jesus to give at the right time.

Some ways to translate *the hidden manna* here are:

* Use a passive clause. For example:

    > the manna that has been hidden away in heaven (NLT)

* Use an active clause. Probably Jesus or God hid the manna. For example:

    > the manna that God has hidden

**manna:** The Greek word *manna* is the name of a food that God miraculously fed to the Israelites in the desert (Exodus 16\). Manna was described as “thin flakes like frost” (Exodus 16:14\). It was also described as “white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with honey” (Exodus 16:31\).

In some languages people may not realize that *manna* refers to a food. It is also possible that the word might be mistaken for a similar word in your language with a different meaning. If that is true in your language, you should indicate that it refers to a food. For example:

> food called manna

> the heavenly food manna

You may also want to give more information in a footnote. An example footnote is:

> Manna is the name of a food that God miraculously gave to the Israelites in the desert. (See Exodus 16\.)

#### 2:17c

**I will also give him a white stone inscribed with a new name,**

* I will also give to him a white stone/pebble that has a new name written on it,
* I will also give to him a white stone/pebble with a new name that God wrote on it.

**a white stone:** The word *stone* probably refers to a small stone that easily fits in someone’s hand. The phrase *a white stone* probably symbolically refers to receiving permission to enter heaven, like receiving a ticket or pass to an event. Many English versions translate this literally.

You may want a footnote to explain the symbol. An example footnote is:

> This white stone probably refers to symbolically receiving permission to enter heaven, something like receiving a ticket/pass.

**inscribed with a new name:** The clause *inscribed with a new name* is passive. Some languages must translate with an active clause or a phrase. For example:

> with a new name that I/God wrote on it

> with a new name on it

If you follow the second example, it should imply that someone wrote the name.

**a new name:** A name is already written on the stone when Jesus gives it to the believer. These verses do not say whose name it is. If possible, do not add any information about whose name it is. The new name is probably one that Jesus gives to the victorious believer. But the new name might be a new name of Jesus (3:12\).

#### 2:17d

**known only to the one who receives it.**

* and this name is known only by the one/person who receives it.
* No one knows this new name except the one who receives it. (NCV)

**known only to the one who receives it:** This clause refers back to the “new name” that is written on the stone in 2:17c. Only the person receiving the stone will know the name on it.

The BSB omits “that is” from the beginning of this clause, as is possible in English here. The Greek is more literally “no one knows except the one receiving it.” Some ways to translate it are:

* Use a passive clause. For example:

    > a name that is known only to the person who receives it (GW)

* Use an active clause. For example:

    > that no one knows except the one who receives it (GNT)

### Section 2:18–29: Jesus spoke to the church at Thyatira

In this section, Jesus spoke to the people who believed in him at Thyatira. He saw that they had grown in their faith. Jesus warned them about allowing an immoral woman named Jezebel to remain among them. He encouraged the believers who had not followed Jezebel’s sinful teachings to remain faithful. Lastly, he gave a promise for any believer who persevered in his faith.

* ¶ “Write to the angel of the church/congregation in Thyatira:
* ¶ “To the angel associated with the gathering of believers in Thyatira, write this:
* ¶ Jesus continued, “Write this message to the angel representing God’s people who are in the city of Thyatira:

**To the angel of the church in Thyatira write:** You should translate this introduction the same way you did in 2:12\. You only need to change the name to *Thyatira*.

#### 2:18b–d

**These are the words of the Son of God, whose eyes are like a blazing fire and whose feet are like polished bronze:** This statement is an introduction to Jesus’ words in 2:19–29\. Translate the clause *These are the words of* in a similar way to 2:1\.

Jesus spoke these words about himself. He continues to speak in 2:19 with “I.” In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that Jesus was talking about someone else here. If that is true in your language, indicate that Jesus spoke about himself. For example:

> These are my words, I, the Son of God. My eyes are like blazing fire and my feet are like burnished bronze.

#### 2:18b

**These are the words of the Son of God,**

* This message is from the Son of God,
* Here is the message from me, the Son of God.

**the Son of God:** This phrase is a title for Jesus. This title was often used to refer to a savior who would be a descendant of King David. God would send this savior to rescue his people. This person was often referred to as the “Messiah” or “Christ.”

The title *the Son of God* also indicates that Jesus has the same nature and character as God. The relationship between God the Father and Jesus, his Son, is similar in some ways to the relationship between human fathers and sons. God the Father does not have a physical body. He did not have a sexual relationship with Mary that resulted in her becoming pregnant and giving birth to Jesus. The Son of God existed eternally as the Son with his Father.

In areas where people do not understand the title *the Son of God* in this way, you may want to include a footnote that explains the correct meaning. Here is a suggested footnote:

> This title refers to Jesus. It indicates that Jesus has the same nature and character as God. It does not mean that God the Father had a sexual relationship with Mary that resulted in her becoming pregnant and giving birth to Jesus. Mary became pregnant with Jesus in a miraculous way by the Holy Spirit of God.

In some languages, it is natural to speak of a son as a “child” without specifying whether male or female. If that is true in your language, you may use a more general term, such as:

> the Child of GodA translation of the title “the Son of God” must include a familial term such as “son” or “child.” Translations such as “the man who is God,” “the divine man,” or “the God man” are not acceptable, since they do not retain familial language. Examples of acceptable translation options include “the Son who comes from God,” and “the divine/unique/eternal Son of God.”

Other verses will usually make clear that Jesus was a male child. If you use a phrase such as “the male child of God,” be sure that it does not imply that God had another child who was female.

#### 2:18c–d

**whose eyes are like a blazing fire and whose feet are like polished bronze:** These clauses tell the reader more about the Son of God. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other Sons of God and, only this one had *eyes…like a blazing fire and…feet…like polished bronze*. If that is true in your language, translate these clauses so that they tell more about the Son of God. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> His eyes are like a blazing fire and his feet are like burnished bronze.

#### 2:18c

**whose eyes are like a blazing fire**

* who has eyes like a fiery flame (NET)
* His/My eyes are as bright as flames

**eyes are like a blazing fire:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *a blazing fire* is literally “a flame of fire” (as in the RSV). This simile probably refers to the brightness of his eyes. You should translate this in a similar way to “eyes were like a blazing fire” in 1:14\. For example:

> eyes looked like flames of fire (CEV)

> eyes were/are as bright as fire

#### 2:18d

**and whose feet are like polished bronze.**

* and whose feet are like polished bronze. (NET)
* and his/my feet are/look like purified bronze/copper/brass. I say this:

**feet are like polished bronze:** This simile indicates that his *feet* were similar in color to *polished bronze*. You should translate this in a similar way to “feet were like polished bronze” in 1:15\.

**I know your deeds—your love, your faith,**

* I know your(sing/plur) activities/accomplishments, love, faith,
* I know everything that you have done, how you love, how you believe,

**I know your deeds:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *deeds* means “actions” or “activities.” You should translate this clause as you did in 2:2\.

The phrase *I know* refers to the whole list in 2:19a–c.

**your:** The pronoun *your* refers to the angel of this church as the representative of the believers there. In some languages it is more natural to use plural pronouns here. See how you translated the pronoun “your” in 2:2 or 2:13\.

**your love, your faith:** In some languages it is necessary or more natural to express the nouns *love* and *faith* as verbs. For example:

> the way you love and the way you believe

#### 2:19b

**your service, your perseverance—**

* service, patience to endure,
* how you serve others, how you persevere in your faith,

**service:** This word refers to the work of helping others. An example of this is the seven deacons of Acts 6:1–4\. They helped others when they gave food to widows. Here, the word *service* refers to any kind of help that is done to honor Jesus. In some languages it is necessary or more natural to translate it using a verb. For example:

> how you serve/help others

**perseverance:** This word indicates that the believers had continued to follow Jesus even though people persecuted them because of it. You should translate this word as you did in 2:2 and 1:9\.

#### 2:19c

**and your latter deeds are greater than your first.**

* and that the deeds you are doing now are greater than the deeds you did at first.
* and I know that that you do more for me now than you did when you first believed.

**your latter deeds are greater than your first:** This is a comparison. They had been doing well when they had first become believers. Now they were doing even better. Other ways to translate this comparison are:

> you are doing now is greater than what you did at first (GW)

> your more recent deeds are greater than your earlier ones (NET)

> you did well before, and/but now you are doing even better.

> what you are doing now surpasses how much you did before

**But I have this against you:**

* ¶ But I have one complaint against you.
* ¶ But there is something I dislike/criticize about your way of life, namely, that

**But I have this against you:** The Greek words here are the same as 2:4a (“But I have this against you”). Translate it as you did in 2:4\.

#### 2:20b

**You tolerate that woman Jezebel,**

* You allow that woman Jezebel to remain in your group/church,
* you let that evil/idolatrous woman Jezebel continue doing as she has done .

**You tolerate that woman Jezebel:** Here the word *tolerate* means “allow someone to continue doing (something).” The believers at Thyatira allowed Jezebel to remain in the church even though she taught false ideas.

In some languages it is necessary or more natural to add the implied information about Jezebel. For example:

> You let that woman Jezebel spread false teachings (NCV)

In some languages it is more natural to translate this with a negative statement. For example:

> You do not put an end/stop to the activities of that woman Jezebel

> You do not prevent that woman Jezebel from teaching in the church

**that woman Jezebel:** The name *Jezebel* is probably symbolic of a false teacher in the church at Thyatira. That person was like the evil Queen Jezebel in the Old Testament (1 Kings 16:29–31; 18:4,19; 19:1–2; 21:1–25\), because she led the people away from God.

In some languages people are not familiar with the story or reputation of Queen Jezebel. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain who she was in your translation. For example:

> that evil/idolatrous woman Jezebel

You may also want to explain who she was in a footnote. An example footnote is:

> The false teacher in Thyatira was given the symbolic name of Jezebel. Jezebel lived about 700 years before Jesus. She was evil, she worshiped idols, and she violently opposed God’s prophets. Stories about her are found in 1 Kings 16–21\.

#### 2:20c

**who calls herself a prophetess.**

* she who claims to be a prophetess.
* She says she is a spokesperson for God,

**who calls herself a prophetess:** This clause indicates that the woman in 2:20b claimed that she was a prophet. But she was not speaking the truth. She was not a true prophet, because she did not speak God’s message. She did speak messages, but they were not from God. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> who claims to be a prophetess (NJB)

> who says she is a prophetess

> who makes the false claim that she speaks messages from God

This clause tells the reader more about the false teacher called Jezebel. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there were others named Jezebel at Thyatira, but only this one called *herself a prophetess*. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about Jezebel. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> She calls herself a prophetess.

**prophetess:** The word *prophetess* means “female prophet.” A prophet is a person whom God uses to communicate with the people. Other ways to translate the word *prophetess* are:

> spokeswoman for God

> God’s message\-speaker

See how you translated the word *prophetess* in Luke 2:36, “prophet” in Matthew 1:22, Mark 1:2, or “prophecy” in Revelation 1:3\.

#### 2:20d

**By her teaching she misleads My servants to be sexually immoral**

* She teaches and misleads my slaves/servants into committing sexual sin
* but by her teaching she deceives those who follow me into doing wrong with someone who is not their spouse

**By her teaching she misleads:** The Greek words are literally “she teaches and misleads.” The two verbs “teach” and “mislead” are connected because she taught things that misled people. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> She teaches and misleads (GW)

> by her teaching deceives (JBP)

**My servants:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *servants* refers to the believers at Thyatira. It is used to indicate that the believers served and obeyed Jesus. See how you translated the word *servants* in 1:1\.

**to be sexually immoral:** This phrase refers to any kind of sexual activities outside of marriage. See how you translated the phrase “sexual immorality” in 2:14\.

#### 2:20e

**and to eat food sacrificed to idols.**

* and eating food that had been offered to idols.
* and eating what was used to honor idols/false\-gods.

**and to eat food sacrificed to idols:** The false prophetess in Thyatira had been encouraging the believers to eat food that had been offered as a sacrifice in honor of idols. You should translate this phrase in the same way as “eat food sacrificed to idols” in 2:14\.

**Even though I have given her time to repent of her immorality,**

* I gave her time to repent of those immoral deeds,
* I allowed her time to stop sinning and change her thinking about her wicked ways,

**I have given her time to repent:** This clause indicates that Jesus had warned the woman earlier to repent. Then he allowed her some time to repent. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> I gave her time to repent (RSV)

> I gave her a chance to turn from her sins (CEV)

> I told her to repent and allowed her time to do so

**repent:** The word *repent* here refers to changing one’s mind, heart, and actions. The person would then stop sinning. See how you translated this word in 2:5\.

**her immorality:** Here the word *immorality* refers to sexual immorality (2:20d). But it probably implies idolatry (2:20e), because God wants her to repent of both sexual immorality and idolatry. So the BSB uses the word *immorality*, which allows for various kinds of immoral behavior, including sexual immorality.

#### 2:21b

**she is unwilling.**

* but she does not want to.
* but she refuses to do so.

**she is unwilling:** This clause indicates that the woman did not want to repent. She chose to continue sinning by teaching lies and doing evil things. Other ways to translate this clause are:

#### 2:22a

**Behold, I will cast her onto a bed of sickness,**

* Look, I am throwing her on a bed of pain,
* Indeed/Hey, I will now cause her to suffer physically.

**Behold:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Behold* is literally “look.” The word emphasizes or calls attention to the words that follow. This word is not a command to look at something.

If you have a word or phrase with that meaning, you may want to use it here. Some examples are:

> Look, (NJB)

> Beware, (NRSV)

> Indeed/Hey,

**I will cast her onto a bed of sickness:** The Greek clause is literally “I am throwing her on a bed.” It is probably a Hebrew idiom that means “I will now cause her to become sick/ill.” The BSB adds the words *of sickness* in order to indicate this meaning. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> I will throw her on a sickbed (RSV)

> I will cause her to become so ill that she cannot get out of bed

In some languages a literal translation would not have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, translate the meaning of the idiom. For example:

> I will cause her body to suffer

**I will cast:** The Greek grammar here is the present tense. Here the present tense indicates “immediately” or “as I speak.”

#### 2:22b

**and those who commit adultery with her will suffer great tribulation**

* and those who commit adultery with her, into great distress,
* And I will now cause her partners in adultery to undergo a severe ordeal/hardship,

**those who commit adultery with her will suffer great tribulation:** The Greek words are literally “those who commit adultery with her into great suffering.” The main verb is from 2:22a—“I will cast.” Other ways to translate this clause are:

> all her partners in adultery to great hardship (NJB)

> those who committed adultery with her will suffer terribly (GNT)

> those who commit adultery with her I am throwing into great distress (NRSV)

**commit adultery:** This phrase refers to sexual immorality of all kinds. It has the same meaning as “commit sexual immorality” in 2:14e.

#### 2:22c

**unless they repent of her deeds.**

* unless they repent of her practices.
* unless they stop sinning, change their thinking, and stop following her teachings.

**unless they repent of her deeds:** There are two issues here.

Issue 1—The Greek text

There is a textual issue here:

1. The earliest Greek manuscripts have her. For example:

    > her (GNT) *(BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NASB, NABRE, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, REB, ESV, NCV)*

2. Some later Greek manuscripts have their. For example:

    > their (KJV) *(KJV, NJB)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT 4 apparatus recommends it.

This phrase indicates that the people were acting the same as the woman. In some languages it is not possible to say that people must repent of someone else’s deeds. In some languages it is more natural to refer to doing the same things. For example:

> repent and stop acting as she does

Issue 2—Meaning

This phrase indicates that if these people repented, then they would not have to suffer. If they stopped committing adultery and eating food sacrificed to idols, God would forgive them. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> if they do not turn away from the wrongs she does (NCV)

> unless they repent and turn away from her evil deeds (NLT)

##### **General Comment on 2:22b–c**

The cause (2:22c) is stated after the consequence (2:22b). In some languages it is more natural to have the cause first. For example:

> 22cUnless they repent of her deeds, 22bthose who commit adultery with her suffer great tribulation.

> 22cIf they do not repent of her deeds, 22bthose who commit adultery with her suffer great tribulation.

**Then I will strike her children dead,**

* I will kill her children,
* I will kill her followers.

**Then I will strike her children dead:** The phrase *strike…dead* means “kill.” For example:

> I will kill her children (GW)

These verses do not say how the children would be killed. In some languages, the way the person was killed must be included. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it allows as general a meaning as possible.

**her children:** This phrase refers figuratively to adults who followed Jezebel’s teachings.Aune (page 206\) says, “‘her children’ refers to the group that should probably be identified with the disciples of ‘Jezebel’ or members of her prophetic circle.” In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer only to actual children of Jezebel. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > her children namely, her followers

    > her followers (GNT)

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > The word “children” here refers to those who followed Jezebel’s teachings.

* and all the churches will know that I am the one who examines heart and mind,
* Then all the groups of believers will know that it is I who investigates people’s true desires and thoughts,

**and:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *and* sometimes introduces a result. Other ways to translate this word are:

> This will teach (REB)

> Then (NIV)

> From that

In some languages it is necessary or more natural to allow the context to imply the connection and not translate this word.

**all the churches:** This phrase indicates that the churches will learn that Jesus searches hearts and minds because they would hear what happened to Jezebel’s followers.

In some languages it is necessary to say that the believers in the *churches* will know. For example:

> people/believers in all the churches

> believers wherever they gather

> God’s people in all places

**searches minds and hearts:** The Greek words are literally “searches the hearts and kidneys.” These two organs of the body (“hearts” and “kidneys”) in Greek refer figuratively to the true desires and thoughts of a person. This phrase indicates that Jesus knows what a person truly desires and what a person truly thinks.

In some languages different organs are used to refer figuratively to true desires and thoughts. For example:

> searches livers and brains

In some languages non\-figurative words or phrases are used. For example:

> knows everyone’s thoughts and wishes (GNT)

> examines desires/intentions and thoughts

#### 2:23c

**and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.**

**But I say to the rest of you in Thyatira,**

* ¶ But I say to the rest of you believers in Thyatira,

**But I say:** In this paragraph Jesus continued to speak. This should be clear to readers and listeners because no one else has been speaking.

In some languages it is more natural to begin a new paragraph by indicating who is speaking. For example:

> Jesus continued, “But I say….”

**But:** The Greek word here is often translated as “and” or “but.” Some English versions, such as the NIV, translate the Greek word here with the English word “now” to introduce what follows.

There is contrast between what Jesus would do with Jezebel and her followers (2:22–23\) and how he encourages the other believers in Thyatira (2:24–28\). This is why the BSB and some other English versions translate the Greek word here as *But*. For example:

> But (RSV, ESV)

**the rest of you:** This phrase refers to the believers in Thyatira who did not follow Jezebel. They were faithful to Jesus.

#### 2:24b

**who do not hold to her teaching**

* all who do not obey/accept her teaching
* that is, to all of you who have rejected her teaching

**who do not hold to her teaching:** The Greek clause is literally “as many as do not have this teaching.” It refers to the people in 2:24a (“the rest of you in Thyatira”). It further describes some of those in Thyatira. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> all who do not accept this teaching (REB)

> that is, all of you who have not followed her teaching

**hold:** Here the word *hold* means “follow” or “obey.” The REB translates it as:

> accept

**her teaching:** The pronoun *her* refers to the false teacher called Jezebel.

#### 2:24c

**and have not learned the so\-called deep things of Satan:**

* and who do not know the deep secrets of Satan, as they are called,
* and who have not learned what some people call the very secret things/knowledge of Satan,

**and have not learned:** This clause tells the reader more about the believers mentioned in 2:24a (“the rest of you in Thyatira”). Other ways to translate this clause are:

> who have not learned (RSV)

> or learnt (NJB)

**learned:** The Greek word is literally “know.” But many English versions refer to learning the secrets.

**the so\-called deep things of Satan:** The Greek phrase here is literally “as they say the deep things of Satan.”

There are two ways to interpret who “they” refers to:

1. It refers to the followers of Jezebel. For example, the CEV says:

    > what her followers call the “deep secrets of Satan.” *(GNT, NASB, KJV, NLT, CEV, REB)*

2. It refers to people in general. For example:

    > what some call the deep things of Satan (RSV) *(BSB, RSV, NIV, NJB, ESV, NABRE, NET, GW, NCV)“Some” could refer to the followers of Jezebel in an indirect way. But at first glance it seems to refer to other people in a general way.*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because “they say” seems to connect to “they” in 2:22\.It is hard to tell from the context which group “they say” refers to. Beale, Lenski, Osbourne, Smalley, Barnett, and Charles support interpretation (1\). But Aune, Johnson, and Mounce support interpretation (2\). But if the major language version supports interpretation (2\), you may want to follow that.

**deep things:** The secrets are figuratively called *deep* because they are well hidden and difficult to discover. The phrase refers to secret knowledge or practices. It refers to the immoral practices described in 2:20d–e as well as other secrets not described here.

#### 2:24d

**I will place no further burden upon you.**

* I will not put any other burden/load on you.
* I will not add any command for you to obey.

**I will place no further burden upon you:** This statement is probably what Jesus said (2:24a) to the believers who have not followed Jezebel. For example:

> But to the rest of you in Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching, who have not learned what some call the deep things of Satan, to you I say, I do not lay upon you any other burden (RSV)

> Now I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, to you who do not hold to her teaching and have not learned Satan’s so\-called deep secrets, ‘I will not impose any other burden on you (NIV2011\)

The word *burden* refers figuratively to something that is difficult to do. This statement indicates that Jesus would not command the faithful believers to do anything else that was difficult. The several ways to translate this clause are:

* Keep the figure of speech. For example:

    > I will not put any other load on you. (NCV)

* Keep the figure of speech and explain its meaning in your translation. For example:

    > So I won’t burden you down with any other commands. (CEV)

* Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:

    > I will ask nothing more of you (NLT)

    > I will not give to you any other difficult command

**no further burden:** The phrase *no further* refers to additional burdens other than those of 2:22–23\.

#### 2:24a–d

**(reordered) ¶ Now to the rest of you** **believers** **in Thyatira, all who do not obey/accept her teaching and who do not know the deep secrets of Satan, as they are called, I say, ‘I will not put any other burden/load on you.’**

* (reordered) ¶ But to the rest of you believers in Thyatira, that is, to all of you who have rejected her teaching and who have not learned what some people call the very secret things/knowledge of Satan, I say that I will not add any command for you to obey.

### Section 2:18–29: Jesus spoke to the church at Thyatira

In this section, Jesus spoke to the people who believed in him at Thyatira. He saw that they had grown in their faith. Jesus warned them about allowing an immoral woman named Jezebel to remain among them. He encouraged the believers who had not followed Jezebel’s sinful teachings to remain faithful. Lastly, he gave a promise for any believer who persevered in his faith.

#### 2:25

**Nevertheless, hold fast to what you have until I come.**

* Regardless, continue to do as you have been doing until I come.
* Nevertheless/Yet continue to believe in me as you have until I come again.

**Nevertheless:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Nevertheless* introduces something important.BDAG, πλὴν, 1\.c, page 826\. There is possible contrast to 2:24d here. Other ways to translate this Greek word are:

> In any caseBDAG.

> Only (NIV)

> However (NET)

**hold fast to what you have:** The phrase *what you have* probably refers generally to Christ’s commands and teaching. It does not refer to earthly goods. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> continue to follow me as you have been

> you must hold firmly to the teaching you have (CEV)

> continue in your loyalty (NCV)

**until I come:** This phrase refers to the second coming of Jesus. You may already have a usual way to refer to the second coming. If so, you may want to use it here. For example:

> until I come again

#### 2:26–28

These verses contain promises that God will reward anyone who overcomes. Several English versions therefore use plural rather than singular forms throughout these verses: “To those who overcome….” If you use plural forms, you should remember that 2:27a–b contains a quotation from the Old Testament. At that time God spoke to one person, the king. You should not translate the quotation in a way that indicates that the original promise was addressed to many people.

#### 2:26a

**And to the one who overcomes and continues in My work until the end,**

* ¶ To anyone who gains victory and follows my commands to the end,
* ¶ To you(plur) believers who defeat/conquer everything that causes a believer to stumble and obey me to the end of the age,

**And to the one who overcomes and continues in My work until the end:** These words are emphasized by being in front of the phrase “I will give” (2:26b). If you have a natural way in your language to emphasize these words, you may want to do so. For example:

> To him who conquers and does the deeds I want him to do until the end, I will give

> To those who win the victory I will give (NCV)

In some languages it is not natural to emphasize these words in this way. For example:

> I will give to him who overcomes and does my will until the end

**overcomes:** The word *overcomes* means “triumphs” or “obtains/wins victory.” Here the word refers to having success over sin, evil, and pressure to turn away from Jesus. Translate this phrase as you did in 2:17\.

**continues in My work:** This phrase refers to doing the works/deeds that Jesus commands believers to do. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> who obey me (NLT)

> follows my commands

**until the end:** This phrase probably has the same meaning as “until I come” in 2:25\. It refers to the end of the present age, when Jesus returns. In some languages it is necessary to include the implied information. For example:

> to the end of the age

#### 2:26b

**I will give authority over the nations.**

* I will give power over the nations.
* I will give the right to rule the nations.

**I will give authority over the nations:** The word *authority* refers to the right and power to control or rule over someone or something. Jesus will enable faithful believers to rule the nations. Other ways to translate this are:

> I will give authority to rule the nations

> I will cause them to rule over the nations

**the nations:** The phrase *the nations* in the Old Testament refers to all non\-Jewish peoples. Here it refers generally to countries and people who are not part of God’s people. It can also refer to groups of people grouped by language or culture.

##### **General Comment on 2:26a–b**

2:26a states to whom the promise was made. 2:26b is the main part of the clause. In some languages it is more natural to put the main part of the clause first. For example:

> 26bI will give power over the nations 26ato everyone who wins the victory and keeps on obeying me until the end. (CEV)

#### 2:26a–b

**(reordered) I will give authority/power over the nations to anyone who gains victory and follows my commands to the end.**

* (reordered) I will give the right to rule the nations to you(plur) believers who defeat/conquer everything that causes a believer to stumble and obey me to the end of the age.

Lastly, he gave a promise for any believer who persevered in his faith.

#### 2:27a–b

**He will rule them with an iron scepter and shatter them like pottery:** This is a quote of Psalm 2:9 (LXX).The Greek translation of the Old Testament is called the Septuagint (abbreviated as LXX). This Greek translation of the Old Testament was done more than a hundred years before Jesus was born. If you indicate the location of quotes from the Old Testament with cross\-references, you may want to do so here.

This kind of *rule* is like destroying things. Jesus *will rule* the nations in a way that destroys them because they fight against him (19:15–19\).Beale (page 267\) and Beckwith (page 471\). Other ways to translate these words are:

> he shall rule them with a rod of iron, as when earthen pots are broken in pieces (RSV)

> He will rule them with an iron stick, as if smashing pottery

> He will rule them with club made of iron, like he would destroy pottery

In some languages a literal translation of the word *rule* would wrongly indicate ruling to their benefit. If that is true in your language, you may want to include some implied information. For example:

> He will lead them with an iron scepter to their own destruction; like dashing pottery to pieces

> He will destructively rule them with an iron scepter; like he would destroy pottery

#### 2:27a

**He will rule them with an iron scepter**

* ‘He will rule them forcefully with an iron staff/stick,
* You(plur) will be as the Scripture says: ‘He will lead/govern them to their destruction with a rod made of iron,

**He:** Here the word *He* refers to believers who overcome and do his will to the end (2:26a). It does not refer to Jesus. Some English versions do not use *He* in 2:27a–b in order to make that clearer. For example:

> They (NLT)

> 26bI will give them authority over the nations, 27ato rule them with an iron rod 27band to break them to pieces like clay pots. (GNT)

**iron:** This word refers to the strongest known metal at that time. It could break most things without damage to itself. Some languages do not have a word for this metal. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use the major language word.
* Describe it. For example:

    > made of very strong metal

* Use the strongest thing in your language. You may then want to explain the Greek word in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Literally: “iron.” This word refers to the strongest known metal at that time. It could break most things without damage to itself.

**scepter:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *scepter* refers to a straight heavy stick. Often a shepherd would use a stick of this kind to fight off wild animals. The word *scepter* refers to an ornamental stick that symbolizes the rule of a king. Other ways to translate this word are:

> stick

> rod/staff

#### 2:27b

**and shatter them like pottery**

* as when clay pots are shattered’— (NRSV)
* he will destroy his enemies as someone smashes/breaks pottery into many pieces.’

**shatter them like pottery:** The Greek words are literally “as when clay pots are shattered” (as in the NRSV). When a clay pot breaks, it shatters into many pieces and becomes useless. This clause explains how believers will rule the nations with an iron rod. They will destroy their enemies. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> as when pottery is broken into pieces (NCV)

> smashing them to pieces like earthenware (REB)

In some languages a literal translation will not indicate the correct meaning of “being destroyed.” If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > he will completely destroy them like when pottery is broken into pieces

* Translate the meaning without the metaphor. For example:

    > he will completely destroy them *You may then want to explain the literal words in a footnote. An example footnote is:*

    > Literally: “as when pottery is broken.” Broken pottery is symbolic of what happens when someone completely destroys his enemies.

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > “When pottery is broken” is symbolic of what happens when someone completely destroys his enemies.

* Use a symbol in your language of something that, when broken, is useless and cannot be repaired. Then you may want to explain the literal words in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Literally: “pottery.” Broken pottery is symbolic of what happens when someone destroys his enemies.

#### 2:27c

**—just as I have received authority from My Father.**

* as I have received authority from my Father,
* I will give that same authority that I have received from my heavenly Father.

Some English versions begin 2:28 here. Follow how the major language version places the verse number.

**—just as I have received authority from My Father:** The words *just as* connect this clause to 2:26b. Jesus received authority to rule the nations from his Father. He will give that same authority to his followers. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> They will have the same authority I received from my Father (NLT)

> This is the same power I received from my Father (NCV)

**authority:** Here the word *authority* refers to the right and power to control or rule over someone or something. You should translate this using the same word or phrase as in 2:26\.

**My Father:** This phrase refers to God. In some languages people will not clearly understand that the phrase *My Father* refers to God. If that is true in your language, you may want to add this implied information. For example:

> my Father God

> my heavenly Father

##### **General Comment on 2:26a–27c**

2:27c is closely connected to 2:26b. In some languages it is more natural to put 2:27c before 2:27a–b. For example:

> 26aTo him who overcomes and does my will to the end, 26bI will give him/them authority over the nations,27cjust as I have received that authority from my Father. As the Scripture says: 27a‘He will rule them with an iron rod, 27bas when clay pots are shattered.’

> 26aTo those who win the victory, who continue to the end to do what I want, 27cI will give the same authority that I received from my Father: 26bI will give them authority over the nations, 27ato rule them with an iron rod 27band to break them to pieces like clay pots. (GNT)

The GNT example above requires that you combine verse numbers as 26–27\.

**And I will give him the morning star.**

* and I will give to him the dawn star.
* I will also give the pre\-dawn star to you who defeat/conquer sin and obey me.

**And I will give him the morning star:** This statement tells the second thing that Jesus will give those who overcome and do his will until the end (2:26\).

In some languages the person to whom the pronoun *him* refers will not be clear. If this is true in your language, you may want to clearly refer to the people who overcome. For example:

> And I will also give to him who overcomes and does my will to the end the morning star

> And I will also give the morning star to that overcomer/victor

> And I will also give the morning star to those overcomers/victors

**the morning star:** This is a symbol, but there are several ways to interpret its symbolic meaning. It may symbolically refer to:

1. A share in the status and authority of Christ.Aune, Smalley.
2. Victory or messianic reign.Beale, Osbourne, Kistemaker.
3. Honor or glory.Kistemaker, Beckwith, Lenski, Hughes.
4. The presence of Christ.Charles, Hughes, Johnson (he adds that it may refer to the Resurrection).

No interpretation is clearly best. So you should translate this phrase literally. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the star of dawn (REB)

> the pre\-dawn star

You may then want to include a footnote to explain the symbolic meaning. An example footnote is:

> The morning star might be symbolic of victory or honor or the presence of Christ.

He told them they must begin to truly trust and obey him again. He encouraged the believers who still completely trusted and obeyed him. Lastly, he gave a promise to any believer who persevered in his faith.

* ¶ “Write to the angel of the church/congregation in Sardis:
* ¶ “To the angel associated with the gathering of believers in Sardis, write this:
* ¶ Jesus continued, “Write this message to the angel representing God’s people who are in the city of Sardis:

**To the angel of the church in Sardis write:** You should translate this clause in the same way that you did in 2:18\. You only need to change the name to *Sardis*.

#### 3:1b

**These are the words of the One**

* This message is from the one
* Here is the message from me, Jesus,

#### 3:1b–c

**These are the words of the One who holds the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars:** This clause is an introduction to the words in 3:2–6\. You should translate the phrase *These are the words of the One who holds* as you did in 2:1\.

Jesus spoke these words about himself. He continues to speak in 3:1d, using the pronoun “I.” In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that Jesus was talking about someone else here. If that is true in your language, indicate that Jesus spoke about himself. For example:

> These are my words, and I hold the seven spirits of God and the seven stars.

**the One who holds:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *holds* also means “has.” Here the word indicates that Jesus in some way possessed or controlled the seven spirits and the seven stars. Translate using a word with that meaning. For example:

> the one who has (GNT)

See how you translated the word “held” in 1:16\.

#### 3:1c

**who holds the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars.**

* who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars.
* the one who has the sevenfold Spirit of God and the seven stars.

**the seven Spirits:** Many scholars believe that the phrase *the seven Spirits* is a symbolic way to refer to the Holy Spirit. Other scholars believe that the phrase refers to seven angels or to seven other spirits who serve God.See the lists of scholars at 1:4\. See how you translated this phrase in 1:4\.

If you used a footnote to explain *the seven Spirits* at 1:4, you may want to:

* Refer your readers to the footnote on *the seven Spirits* at 1:4\. For example:

    > See footnote on “the seven Spirits” at 1:4\.

* Repeat all or most of the footnote at 1:4 here.

#### 3:1d

**I know your deeds;**

* I know your(sing/plur) activities/accomplishments,
* I know everything that you have done.

**I know your deeds:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *deeds* means “actions” or “activities.” You should translate this clause as you did in 2:19\.

**your:** As in the beginning of the other letters, the pronoun *your* is second person singular. This pronoun refers to the angel of the church as the representative of all the believers there. In many languages it is more natural to use plural pronouns here and in the following verses to refer to the believers directly. See how you translated this pronoun in 2:2\.

#### 3:1e

**you have a reputation for being alive, yet you are dead.**

* that is, your reputation is that you are alive, but you are dead.
* Everyone thinks that you are alive in your faith, but you are dead.
* People say you follow me well and so call you “alive,” but that is not true. You follow me so poorly that you should be called “dead.”

In the Greek, 3:1e begins with a word that means “that.” It introduces an explanation. Some ways to translate this word are:

> that (KJV)

> how (NJB)

The BSB and some English versions end 3:1d with a semi\-colon (;) to indicate that there is a connection and allow the context to imply that 3:1e explains 3:1d. Other English versions end 3:1d with a period and allow the context to imply that 3:1e explains 3:1d.

**you have a reputation for being alive:** The word *reputation* refers to what people thought and said about the believers in Sardis. The people thought that the faith of these believers was *alive*. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> People say that you are alive (NCV)

> You are known for being alive (GW)

> Everyone may think you are alive (CEV)

**alive…dead:** The word *alive* refers figuratively to following/obeying Jesus well. The word *dead* refers figuratively to following Jesus very poorly. People thought that the believers in Sardis followed Jesus well. But in fact the believers did not. They did not behave according to what they said they believed. They were like dead people, who cannot even move their bodies.

In some languages people will think that this saying refers to only physical life and death. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > having faith that is alive, but your faith is dead

    > being spiritually alive, but you are spiritually dead

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > The words “alive” and “dead” refer to their faith. Others thought that these believers followed Jesus well. But these believers did not follow Jesus well at all.

#### 3:2a

**Wake up and strengthen what remains, which was about to die;**

* Awake and strengthen what you still have before it dies completely,
* Open your eyes and mind/heart! Strengthen the little faith/life in me that you have left. It has almost ceased to exist.

**Wake up:** This is a figure of speech by which Jesus commanded the believers at Sardis to begin following/obeying him well. He compares this change to waking up from sleep and being alert. He wanted them to understand the danger they were in.

In some languages the expression *Wake up* is not used in that way. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > Wake up and see/realize that your faith is dead.

* Use another saying that warns someone about a danger. For example:

    > Look out!

    > Pay attention! *You may then want to tell the literal words in a footnote. For example:*

    > Literally: “Wake up!”

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. Some example footnotes are:

    > This command indicates that the believers in Sardis needed to become aware that they were not following/obeying Jesus well. They needed to realize that they were in danger because of that.

    > This command indicates that these believers needed to realize they were following/obeying Jesus poorly.

**strengthen what remains, which was about to die:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *what remains* is “the remaining (things).” It probably refers to all the good ways that believers are supposed behave in regard to their faith. They should have love, faith, service, and perseverance. The believers in Sardis did not love very much or believe very much or serve very much or persevere very much.

The phrase *was about to die* indicates that their small amount of love, faith, service, and perseverance was becoming even less. The command to *strengthen* indicates that they should increase their love, faith, service, and perseverance. Other ways to translate this whole clause are:

> strengthen what you still have before it dies completely (GNT)

> Strengthen what little remains, for even what is left is almost dead. (NLT)

In some languages a literal translation would not have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain what this refers to in your translation. For example:

    > strengthen your weak faith that is left which is close to ceasing\-to\-exist.Kankanaey Back Translation on TW.

    > Your faith is growing small and about to end, so make it big/full

* Speak of people strengthening themselves. For example:

    > Make yourselves stronger before what you have left dies completely. (NCV)

    > You have only a little strength left, and it is almost gone. So try to become stronger. (CEV)

* Use words different from *strengthen* or *die*. For example:

    > your faith is small and getting smaller, so make it big

    > your way of doing good deeds is like a fire about to go out, so help each other make the way good again

#### 3:2b

**for I have found your deeds incomplete in the sight of My God.**

* because I have not found that your actions have been complete before my God.
* For I have found that you have not fulfilled what my God wants you to do.

**for:** This word introduces a reason for the warning in 3:2a.

**I have found your deeds incomplete:** There are two ways to interpret the Greek clause that the BSB translates as *I have found your deeds incomplete*:

1. It refers to the believers not finishing the deeds that God or Jesus had given them to do. For example:

    > I have found that what you are doing has not been completed (GW) *(BSB, NIV, NASB, NABRE, GW, CEV, NET, REB, NCV, ESV)*

2. It refers to the believers not doing the deeds well. For example:

    > I find that what you have done is not yet perfect (GNT) *(RSV, GNT, NJB, NLT)The KJV uses the word “perfect,” but at the time of the KJV (the year 1611\) the word “perfect” also had the sense of “complete” as in option (1\).*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because the Greek word refers to something which is full or complete rather than the quality of something which is perfect.Beale (page 274\) calls them “incomplete works.” Other ways to translate interpretation (1\) are:

> I have not found any work of yours brought to completion (REB)

> I have found that what you are doing is less than what my God wants. (NCV)

**in the sight of My God:** This phrase is more literally “before My God.” It means “as God thinks about it” or “according to God.” Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> before God (KJV)

### Section 3:1–6: Jesus spoke to the church at Sardis

In this section, Jesus spoke to the people who believed in him at Sardis. He said that although people thought that the believers in Sardis trusted and obeyed him well, this was not true. He told them they must begin to truly trust and obey him again. He encouraged the believers who still completely trusted and obeyed him. Lastly, he gave a promise to any believer who persevered in his faith.

#### 3:3a

**Remember, then, what you have received and heard.**

* Therefore, remember the teachings that you have heard and accepted.
* Therefore, remember the teachings that you believed when you heard them.

**what you have received and heard:** This phrase refers to the gospel. It includes the teaching of the apostles, both spoken and written teaching. The English verb *received* implies that someone else gave what they received. God gave the gospel to the apostles and believers.

In some languages the words “take” and “receive” are translated by the same verb. In some languages this verb does not imply that someone else gave something. Your translation should imply or indicate that God gave the gospel. For example:

> the teaching that you were given and that you heard (CEV)

Hearing the gospel comes before accepting it. In some languages it is more natural to place the word “hearing” first. For example:

> what you heard and received/accepted

#### 3:3b

**Keep it and repent.**

* Obey them and repent.
* Follow these teachings carefully and change your thinking!

**Keep it:** Here the phrase *Keep it* refers to following the gospel (what the believers had received) and valuing it. See how you translated this Greek word (BSB: “obey”) in 1:3\.

**repent:** This word refers to changing one’s mind and actions. Jesus wanted the people in the church at Sardis to stop sinning and begin obeying God. Other ways to translate this are:

> turn to me again (NLT)

> change your hearts and lives

> leave the ways of sin and follow the ways of God

See how you translated this word in 2:5\.

#### 3:3c

**If you do not wake up, I will come like a thief,**

* But if you do not awake, I will come like a thief does,
* But if you do not open your eyes and mind/heart, I will come unexpectedly.

**I will come like a thief:** This phrase refers to approaching someone in a way that this person does not notice him. The way Jesus *will come like a thief* is explained in 3:3d. Jesus will come unexpectedly, like thieves do.Aune (page 221\). The phrase *like a thief* does not mean he will come to steal.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that Jesus will come to steal. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use the example that people in your language use for someone or something unexpected and unwelcome. For example, there might be a saying for someone who conducts surprise inspections or examinations. You may then want to explain the Greek word in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Literally: “thief.” Here the words “come like a thief” means “come unexpectedly.”

* Clearly indicate that 3:3d explains 3:3c. For example:

    > I will come like a thief, that is, 3dyou will not know at what time I will come to you.

* Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:

    > I will come unexpectedly *You may then want a footnote to explain the literal words. An example footnote is:*

    > Literally: “I will come like a thief.” Here these words indicates that Jesus will come unexpectedly.

#### 3:3d

**and you will not know the hour when I will come upon you.**

* namely, you will not know ahead of time when I will come against you.
* So/Indeed, you will not know at what time I will come and deal with your sin.

**you will not know:** The Greek clause has two words that mean “not.” This emphasizes the meaning of *not*. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> you will not know in any way

> you will have no clue

**hour:** Here this word refers generally to the moment when Jesus would come to them.

**I will come upon you:** The Greek word that the BSB literally translates as *upon* probably means “against” here. Jesus will come against those at Sardis who do not repent. He will come to punish them. Use the way that is natural in your language to indicate this. For example:

> I will come against you (ESV)

He told them they must begin to truly trust and obey him again. He encouraged the believers who still completely trusted and obeyed him.

#### 3:4a

**But you do have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their garments,**

* ¶ But a few of you there in Sardis have not dirtied/defiled your clothes.
* ¶ Yet there are a few of you believers in Sardis who have not made their clothes impure by being unfaithful to me.

**people:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *people* is literally “names” (as in the RSV). But here the word “names” refers to people.

**who have not soiled their garments:** This phrase symbolically represents the idea that some believers in Sardis had not sinned. Here it probably refers to avoiding the pagan activities there. The symbol of clean garments continues into 3:4b–5a. For example:

> have not dirtied your clothes with sin (CEV)

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer only to literal clean garments. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > have not dirtied your garments with pagan activities

* Use a verb that figuratively implies sin. For example:

    > who have not dirtied/stained/defiled their garments

* Translate literally and explain its symbolic meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > This clause refers to remaining faithful to Jesus Christ by refusing to participate in pagan activities.

**soiled:** This word means “caused to be dirty/defiled.” See the examples above.

#### 3:4b

**and because they are worthy, they will walk with Me in white.**

* They will walk with me, clothed in white, because they deserve that/it.
* They will walk with me wearing white/pure clothes, for they are worthy of that honor.

3:4b tells the promise given to the faithful believers in 3:4a. Consider how to indicate that connection in your language.

**because they are worthy:** The clause *because they are worthy* indicates that it was proper and appropriate for these believers to walk with Jesus. They deserved this honor because they had not soiled their clothes. In other words, they had not sinned like the other believers in Sardis did. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> because they deserve it (GW)

> and they are fit to come with me (NJB)

**walk with Me in white:** This phrase indicates that the people walking with Jesus were wearing white clothes. For example:

> will wear white clothes (NCV)

The color *white* is symbolic of purity and freedom from sin. In some languages white is symbolic of something else (such as mourning). If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the symbolic meaning of *white* in your translation. For example:

    > dressed in white to symbolize their pure hearts

* Translate the symbolic meaning of *white*. For example:

    > dressed in pure/clean clothes

#### 3:5a

**Like them, he who overcomes will be dressed in white.**

* Anyone who gains victory will be similarly clothed in white.
* You(plur) believers who defeat everything that causes a believer to stumble will have/wear white clothes like them.

**Like them:** The Greek phrase is literally “in similar manner.” This phrase refers to the believers dressed in white in 3:4b.

**he who overcomes:** The phrase *he who overcomes* is emphasized in the Greek by being first in the clause. If you have a natural way in your language to emphasize this phrase, you may want to do so. For example:

> As for he who conquers, he

> Regarding those who win the victory, they

In some languages it is not natural to emphasize this the phrase. For example:

> The one who overcomes

See how you translated this phrase in 2:11\.

**overcomes:** The word *overcomes* means “triumphs” or “obtains/wins victory.” Here the word refers to having success over sin, evil, and pressure to turn away from Jesus. Translate this phrase in a similar way to “the one who overcomes” in 2:26\.

#### 3:5b

**And I will never blot out his name from the Book of Life,**

* I will never erase his name from the book of life,
* I will never remove your names from the book with/containing the names of those who have eternal life,
* I will cause their names to remain written in the book that lists/names those who will live eternally,

**And I will never blot out his name from the Book of Life:** The phrase *blot out* means “remove.” Here Jesus promised that he will never remove the overcomer’s name from the Book of Life. For example:

> I will not erase his name from the Book of Life. (NASB)

**his name:** This phrase refers to the name of anyone who is worthy. For example:

> that name (NJB)

**the Book of Life:** This phrase refers to the *Book* that contains the names of people to whom God will give eternal *Life*. In some languages the meaning of the word *of* would not be clear here. If that is true in your language, explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

> the book in which are the names of those who have eternal life

> the book with/having the names of those to whom God will give eternal life

#### 3:5c

**but I will confess his name before My Father and His angels.**

* but will publicly declare his name before my Father and his angels.
* but will announce your names as followers of mine in the presence of God my Father and his angels.
* and I will publicly show that I accept/claim him as my follower in front of my Father and his angels.

**I will confess his name:** Here the word *confess* means “publicly declare.” Jesus will announce that this person believes in him. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> claim him as my follower

> announce…that they are mine (NLT)

> declare openly that they belong to me (GNT)

**before My Father and His angels:** The phrase *before My Father and His angels* indicates that God and the angels will be watching and listening while Jesus acknowledges that the faithful overcomer believes in Jesus and therefore is worthy of eternal life. Another way to translate this is:

> in the presence of my Father and the angels

In this section, Jesus spoke to the people who believed in him at Philadelphia. He prophesied that they would have an opportunity to do great things for him. He said that the Jews there would acknowledge that God loves the believers. Jesus then also said that he would protect them from a time of hardship. He encouraged them to remain strong in their faith. Lastly, he gave a promise to any believer who persevered in his faith.

#### 3:7a

**To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write:**

* ¶ “Write to the angel of the church/congregation in Philadelphia:
* ¶ “To the angel associated with the gathering of believers in Philadelphia, write this:
* ¶ “Write this message to the angel representing God’s people who are in the city of Philadelphia:

**To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write:** You should translate this clause in the same way as you did in 3:1\. You only need to change the name to *Philadelphia*.

#### 3:7b–d

**These are the words of the One who is holy and true, who holds the key of David. What He opens no one can shut, and what He shuts no one can open:** These words are an introduction to the words in 3:8–13\. You should translate the phrase *These are the words of the One who* in a way similar to 3:1\.

Jesus spoke these words about himself. He continues to speak in 3:8, using the pronoun “I.” In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that Jesus was talking about someone else here. If that is true in your language, indicate that Jesus spoke about himself. For example:

> These are my words, and I am holy and true. I hold the key of David. What I open no one can shut, and what I shut no one can open.

#### 3:7b

**These are the words of the One who is holy and true,**

* This message is from the holy and true one/being,
* Here is the message from me, Jesus, the one who is sacred/perfect/sinless and speaks truth.

**the One who is holy and true:** The Greek words are literally “the holy one, the true one” (as in the RSV). Both phrases are like titles. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> him who is the holy one and the true one

> the holy and true one

**holy:** Here this word indicates that Jesus is perfect and unique, as God is. He only does what is right. He is different from all other beings because he is perfect and divine. Other ways to translate *holy* are:

> sacred/divine

> pure/perfect spiritually/morally

> unique/separate

**true:** Here the word *true* probably means “genuine” or “without lies.” Other ways to translate this word are:

> a man of truth

> one who speaks truth

#### 3:7c–8b

These verses contain a metaphor about a key. These verses also contain a metaphor about opening or shutting something. Both metaphors refer to authority. See the notes below for more information.

#### 3:7c

**who holds the key of David.**

* the one who has the key of King David, the one
* I am the one who holds the key of authority over David’s kingdom.

**who holds the key of David:** The Greek clause is literally “the one having the key of David.” John described Jesus as possessing this key. This clause figuratively represents the idea that he has the authority that the key represents. For example:

> who has the key of David (RSV)

**the key of David:** This phrase is a metaphor. The word *key* refers to authority. As King David had authority over the kingdom of God’s people, so Jesus also has authority over the kingdom. Jesus fulfills the prophecies that God gave about David’s descendant and heir. Jesus has the right to rule as that descendant.

In some languages a literal translation would not have the figurative meaning of authority. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the symbolic meaning in your translation. For example:

    > the key of authority over David’s kingdom

    > the key of David, namely, authority over his kingdom

* Translate the meaning without the symbol. For example:

    > full authority over David’s kingdom

    > the right to rule as king in David’s line/place *You may then want a footnote to explain the literal words. An example footnote is:*

    > Literally: “the key of David.” This phrase refers to authority to rule.

* Translate literally and explain the Greek words in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > The “key of David” refers to authority to rule God’s kingdom. God promised to David that his descendant would rule over that kingdom.

**David:** David was the second king of Israel. He lived about a thousand years before Revelation was written. He was faithful to God, and God promised him that someone from his family would reign forever (2 Samuel 7:16, Isaiah 9:6–7\).

In some languages it will be helpful to say that David was the king of Israel, God’s people. For example:

> King David

> David the former/ancient king of Israel

> King David who ruled God’s people long ago

#### 3:7d

**What He opens no one can shut, and what He shuts no one can open.**

* who opens and no one will shut, who shuts and no one opens. (NRSV)
* When I open a door, no one can shut it, and when I shut it, no one can open it.
* The door that I open, no one can shut. Also, the door that I shut, no one can open.

**What He opens no one can shut, and what He shuts no one can open:** 3:7d continues describing Jesus. He has full authority. Once he decides something, no one can change that decision. The NRSV follows the Greek word order and Greek grammar:

> who opens and no one will shut, who shuts and no one opens

As in the above example, the Greek words are not a new sentence here. But in some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here, as the BSB does.

**opens…shuts:** These verses do not say what Jesus opens and shuts. The word “doors” is probably implied, as in 3:8b.

In some languages it is more natural to include the implied information in your translation. For example:

> When he opens a door, no one can close it. And when he closes it, no one can open it. (NCV)

The words of 3:7d refers figuratively to authority. It probably refers specifically to the authority to let people enter through the door. Jesus makes all decisions about who can enter the kingdom of God’s people.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer only to opening and closing physical doors. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > He is sovereign, and so when he opens the door of/to the kingdom, no one can shut it, and when he shuts the door, no one can open it.

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > This saying indicates that Jesus allows some people to enter his kingdom and prevents others from doing so. He is sovereign, and he alone decides.

#### 3:8a

**I know your deeds.**

* I know your(sing/plur) activities/accomplishments,
* I know everything that you have done.

**I know your deeds:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *deeds* means “actions” or “activities.” You should translate this clause as you did in 3:1\.

**your:** The Greek pronoun that the BSB translates as *your* is singular. It refers to the angel of the church as the representative of all the believers there.

In many languages it is more natural to use plural pronouns here and in the following verses to refer to the believers directly. This is the same issue as in 3:1d.

#### 3:8b

**See, I have placed before you an open door, which no one can shut.**

* Look/Indeed, I have put before you an open door that no one can shut.
* Listen/Hey, I have opened the door for you, and no one can close that door.
* No one at all can stop/prevent you from entering the door to enter the kingdom that I have opened for you.

**See:** The word emphasizes or calls attention to the words that follow. The word is not a command to look at something. Other ways to translate this word are:

> Indeed/Wow

> Listen/Hey!

See how you translated this word in 1:7 or 2:22 (“Behold” in BSB).

**I have placed before you an open door, which no one can shut:** There are several ways to interpret the metaphor of *an open door*. The two main ways are:

1. The “open door” represents the way into God’s kingdom.
2. The “open door” represents the opportunity to serve and witness and help people to follow Christ.

Some languages can use the metaphor of *an open door* to allow for one or both interpretations. But in some languages a literal translation would mean something else entirely. If that is true in your language, use a different metaphor or plain language that allows for one or both interpretations. For example:

> I have placed a road before you that no one can block

> I have given to you an opportunity that no one can thwart/frustrate

#### 3:8c

**For you have only a little strength,**

* I know that you have little ability to serve me,
* I also know that you have little power to do things for God,

**you have only a little strength:** Here this phrase probably refers to the fact that this was a small church. It was not strong in numbers, wealth, or influence in society. The people of this church were, therefore, not able to do much for Jesus. This phrase does not imply that they were sinning. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> you are not very strong (NJB)

> you are weak in what you able to do

#### 3:8d

**yet you have kept My word and have not denied My name.**

* but have followed my teachings and not disowned/rejected me.
* but have obeyed my commandments and not denied that you are my followers.

**have kept My word:** The word *kept* here means “followed” or “obeyed.” The believers in Philadelphia had obeyed Jesus’ commands and teachings. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> have followed my teaching (GNT)

> have kept my commandments (NJB)

**have not denied My name:** This clause indicates that the believers in Philadelphia had not rejected Jesus. They had openly declared that they followed him. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> did not deny me (NLT)

> did not deny that you are my followers (CEV)

> have not disowned me

> have been faithful/loyal to me

#### 3:9a

**Look at those who belong to the synagogue of Satan,**

* Look/Indeed, at those who are in the group/synagogue that follows Satan,
* Indeed/Hey, those in the group that belongs to Satan,

**Look:** 3:9a begins with the Greek word that the BSB has translated literally as *Look*. This word calls attention to, or emphasizes, the words that follow it. This word is not a command to look at something. Other ways to translate this word are:

> Behold (ESV)

> Listen! (GNT)

> Indeed/Hey

**those who belong to the synagogue of Satan:** Here the word *synagogue* refers to the group of misled Jews in Philadelphia. The word does not refer to the building where they met. So the GNT translates this as:

> that group that belongs to Satan

See how you translated the phrase *synagogue of Satan* in 2:9\.

#### 3:9b

**who claim to be Jews but are liars instead.**

* those who falsely claim to be true Jews but are liars.
* (they claim as Jews to be the true people of God but they lie).

**who claim to be Jews but are liars instead:** These clauses explain the phrase “synagogue of Satan.” These Jews claimed to be the true people of God. But they rejected Jesus as the Christ, so they were lying about being God’s people. Other ways to translate these clauses are:

> those who falsely claim to be Jews, but are liars (NJB)

> those liars who say they are Jews but are not (NLT)

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that John was thinking of other synagogues of Satan, and only this group claimed *to be Jews but are liars instead*. If that is true in your language, translate these clauses so that they tell more about the synagogue of Satan here. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> They claim to be God’s people, but they are liars. (CEV)

If you do this, you will need to put this information either at the beginning or the end of the verse. For example:

> 9aA synagogue of Satan exists there. 9bThey claim to be Jews though they are not, but are liars. 9cI will make them come and fall down at your feet 9dand acknowledge that I have loved you.

> 9aI will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan 9ccome and fall down at your feet 9dand acknowledge that I have loved you. 9bThey claim to be Jews though they are not, but are liars.

**who claim to be Jews but:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *but* is literally “and” (or sometimes “but”). Here there is contrast between *who claim to be Jews* and the clause “are liars instead.” But in English two uses of “but” this near to each other is not natural. Other ways to translate these words are:

> who claim to be Jews and are not, but (NABRE)

> who claim to be Jews but they are not, for

#### 3:9c

**I will make them come and bow down at your feet,**

* Look, I will cause them to come and prostrate themselves at your feet
* Indeed/Hey, I will make them go to you and bow down before you,

**I will make them come:** 3:9c begins with the Greek word that means “look.” This word calls attention to, or emphasizes, the words that follow. Other ways to translate this are:

> look, I will make them come

> indeed/hey, I will make them come

In some languages it is more natural not to repeat the word that you used at the beginning of 3:9a. If that is true in your language, it will be better to not translate it here, as the BSB has done.

The Greek word may also be used to indicate that the explanation (3:9b) is finished. Jesus then continued talking about what he will do to them. See note at 3:9b about reordering the clauses in this verse.

**I will make them come:** This indicates that Jesus would cause these false Jews to honor those who believed in Jesus. In some languages it is more natural to indicate where they would come. For example:

> I will make them come before you (NCV)

**bow down at your feet:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *bow down* refers here to kneeling and putting the face to the ground with arms outstretched toward someone. This position showed complete humility before that person and honored him. This is the usual way to show someone honor at that time and in that region. Translate these words in a way that indicates that someone is honoring someone else. For example:

> prostrate themselves at your feet

> kneel with their face to the ground before you

> bow down at your feet (GNT)

Some languages have a different action that shows complete humility and honor to someone. If that is true in your language, you may want to use that action here.

#### 3:9d

**and they will know that I love you.**

* and know/realize that I love you.
* and they will recognize that I love you.

**know:** The group called “the synagogue of Satan” would realize that God loves the believers. Other ways to translate this word are:

> realize (GW)

> learn (RSV)

> acknowledge (NIV)

**I love you:** The Greek grammar here refers generally to Jesus loving believers. It indicates that Jesus loved them in the past and continues to love them in the present. In your translation, indicate that Jesus loved the believers at all times. For example:

> I love you (BSB, GNT)

**love:** The word *love* refers to a strong feeling of affection and concern for a person.

#### 3:10a–b

**have kept…will…keep:** The same Greek verb occurs twice here. However, the phrase *have kept* (3:10a) means “obeyed” and the phrase *will…keep* (3:10b) means “will protect.” The same Greek verb is used to emphasize the reason\-result connection between the two clauses.

Some languages need to use different verbs in order to indicate the correct meaning in both clauses. If that is true in your language, you may want to emphasize the reason\-result connection in some other way. For example:

> Since you have obeyed my command to endure patiently, indeed, I will protect you during the time/hour of trial

> You obeyed my message and endured. So I will protect you from the time of trouble that everyone in all the world must go through. (CEV)

#### 3:10a

**Because you have kept My command to persevere,**

* You have kept my order to patiently endure,
* You have obeyed my warning to persevere in your faith,

**Because:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Because* here introduces a reason for what is said in 3:10b. In some languages it is more natural to introduce 3:10b as a result. For example:

> 10aYou have kept my command to endure patiently, 10bso I will also keep…

**you have kept My command to persevere:** The believers in Philadelphia had continued to follow Jesus faithfully in spite of suffering. Jesus had commanded them to do that. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> you have obeyed my command to persevere

> You have obeyed my teaching about not giving up your faith (NCV)

**command:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *command* is literally “word.” This word may refer to a command given in a prophecy to the believers in Philadelphia. Or it may refer to a command that Jesus gave during his lifetime to all believers.

**persevere:** The Greek word here is the same word that is translated as “perseverance” in 2:19b. Jesus wanted the believers to continue to follow him faithfully even though they suffered because of it. See how you translated this Greek word in 2:19 or 2:2\.

#### 3:10b

**I will also keep you from the hour of testing**

* therefore I will keep you safe from the time of testing
* so I will bring you out of the ordeal

**I will also keep you from the hour of testing:** There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as *from*:

1. It means from. For example:

    > I will keep you from the hour of trial (RSV) *(BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NASB, NLT, CEV, NET, REB, NCV, ESV, KJV)*

2. It means during. For example:

    > I will keep you safe in the time of trial (NJB) *(NJB, NABRE, GW)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because the Greek word means “out of,” and a different Greek word means “during.”Beale (page 289\) has “from.” See the note below for more information about the meaning of the word *from*.

**I will also keep you from:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *from* refers to removing something from something else. Here Jesus will remove the believers in Philadelphia from the hour of trial. Other ways to translate this word are:

> I will remove you out of

> I will also keep you safe from (GNT)

**keep you:** Here the word *keep* refers to Jesus protecting his followers in some way. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> protect you

> preserve you

**the hour of testing:** This phrase refers to a time of hardship. It is a time when people will suffer greatly. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the time of trouble (GNT)

> the great time of testing (NLT)

> the ordeal (REB)

**hour:** The word *hour* refers figuratively to a specific period of time. But here is not clear if it is hours, days, months, or years. Use a word or phrase that allows that general meaning.

**testing:** This word can mean “testing” or “trial” or “hardship.” God will test people with hardship to see if they will obey or trust him. You may want to see how you translated this word in 2:10 (“to test”), Luke 8:13, or James 1:2, or refer to the notes there.

#### 3:10c

**that is about to come upon the whole world,**

* which will occur everywhere
* that people all over the world will experience.

**that is about to come upon the whole world:** The Greek words are literally “that will happen to everyone in the world.” Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> that will come to the whole world (NCV)

> that is to fall upon the whole world (REB)

**come upon the whole world:** Here the phrase *come upon* means “happen to.” All the words here indicate that the whole world will experience something difficult. Other ways to translate this are:

> occur in all the world

> that the whole world will experience

#### 3:10d

**to test those who dwell on the earth.**

* in order to test those who dwell upon the earth.
* Indeed, all people on this earth will go though that ordeal.

**to test those who dwell on the earth:** This clause indicates the purpose of “the hour of testing” mentioned in 3:10b. Its purpose is to *test* people, to see if they really obey or trust God. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> indeed, to test/try those living on the earth

> in order to test all those on this earth

In some languages explaining the purpose of the test is more natural. For example:

> to test the faith of those who live on the earth

**test:** The Greek word here has the same basic meaning as “testing” in 3:10b. The Greek word here is a verb, but the Greek word in 3:10b is a noun. See the examples above.

##### **General Comment on 3:10a–d**

In the Greek and the BSB, this verse is one long sentence. In some languages it is more natural to translate it as two or more sentences. For example:

> 10aYou have kept my command to endure patiently. 10bSo I will also keep you from the hour of trial 10cthat is coming upon the whole world. 10dIt will test the faith of those who live on earth.

> 10aYou have obeyed my teaching about not giving up your faith. 10bSo I will keep you from the time of trouble 10cthat will come to the whole world 10dto test those who live on earth. (NCV)

#### 3:11a

**I am coming soon.**

* ¶ I am coming quickly.
* ¶ I am coming without delay.

**I am coming:** There are two ways to interpret this clause:

1. Jesus physically coming the second time to the whole world.
2. Jesus spiritually visiting the believers in Philadelphia to encourage them.

The English versions translate this clause literally. It is best to translate literally; do not say where Jesus will come. Both interpretations are possible, but more scholars follow interpretation (1\). See how you translated a similar clause in 2:25 (“until I come”).

#### 3:11b

**Hold fast to what you have,**

* Hold on to all of your ways of believing in me that you have,
* Continue strong in your faith (NCV)

**Hold fast to what you have:** This clause refers to the believers remaining strong in their faith. It does not refer to the believers keeping their physical belongings. In some languages a literal translation would not have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, make it clear that Jesus referred to their faith. For example:

> Continue strong in your faith (NCV)

#### 3:11c

**so that no one will take your crown.**

* so that no one can take your reward from you.
* so no one will take away your wreath of victory, namely eternal life.
* so that your victory prize/reward will not be stolen.

**so that no one will take your crown:** This is a negative purpose clause. It expresses something to be avoided. Jesus did not say who might take away the crown. He was probably referring to Satan and other evil ones who might tempt believers to stop following Jesus. Other ways to translate this are:

> so that no one may seize your crown (ESV)

> let no one deprive you of your crown (JBP)

> and let no one rob you of your crown (REB)

**crown:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *crown* refers to a victor’s wreath. It was the reward for winning a contest. Here it is a symbol for the reward of eternal life. See how you translated this word in 2:10\.

In some languages it is necessary to explain what the crown is used for here. For example:

> the crown that you will be given as your reward (CEV)

> your victory prize (GNT)

**The one who overcomes I will make a pillar in the temple of My God,**

* Anyone who gains victory, I will make to be like a pillar in the temple of my God,
* You(plur) who defeat all that causes a believer to stumble, I will cause you to be always in my God’s presence. You will be like a column/post in his temple.

**The one who overcomes I will make:** The phrase *The one who overcomes* is emphasized by being first in the clause. Jesus will cause/make this person to become like a pillar. If you have a natural way in your language to emphasize the phrase *The one who overcomes*, you may want to do so. For example:

> He who conquers, I will make him (RSV)

In some languages it is not natural to have the phrase *The one who overcomes* first in the clause. For example:

> I will make him who overcomes

**The one who overcomes:** The word *overcomes* means “triumphs” or “obtains/wins victory.” Translate this phrase as you translated it in 3:5\. Notice that the word *one* is the object, not the subject, of the main verb “make.”

**a pillar in the temple of My God:** This phrase probably refers symbolically to being in the presence of God.

In some languages a literal translation would not have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > I will make him to be like a pillar in the temple of My God.

    > I will cause him to be always in my God’s presence like a pillar in His temple.

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > The overcomer/victor is like “a pillar in the temple of my God” because he will always be in God’s presence.

**pillar:** The word *pillar* refers to a column/post that supports a building or roof.

Pillars were made from stacked stone blocks, so they were strong for a very long time.

**temple:** The word *temple* refers to a building where God or another deity is believed to be present in a special way. People worship there.

#### 3:12b

**and he will never again leave it.**

* and he will never depart from it.
* You(plur) will always be in his/God’s presence.

**and he will never again leave it:** This clause continues to use the symbol of a temple to represent the presence of God. Jesus indicated that the faithful believer would never need to leave God’s presence. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> he will never depart from it (NET)

> he will always remain there

#### 3:12c

**Upon him I will write the name of My God,**

* I will write on him my God’s name
* I will write on you(plur) my God’s name to indicate that God is your Lord

**Upon him I will write the name of My God:** This clause is a figure of speech which indicates that the one who overcomes sin belongs to God.

In some languages a literal translation would not clearly indicate or imply that the overcomer belongs to God. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > I will write on him the name of my God to mark/show that he belongs to God

    > I will write on him the name of my God to mark/show that God is his Lord/Master

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Jesus will write the name of God on the one who overcomes. The name shows that he or she belongs to God.

#### 3:12d

**and the name of the city of My God (the new Jerusalem**

* and the name of my God’s city, namely the new Jerusalem,
* and the name of his city. It is the new Jerusalem, (CEV)

**and the name of the city of My God (the new Jerusalem:** Jesus said that he will also write the name of *the new Jerusalem* on any believer who overcomes. This name indicates that the one who overcomes is a citizen of the *new Jerusalem*. He belongs to this city and has a right to live there.

In some languages a literal translation would not indicate or imply the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > I will mark him as a citizen of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > This indicates that the one who overcomes belongs to the new Jerusalem. He has the right to live there as a citizen.

**the city of My God (the new Jerusalem:** The phrases *the city of My God* and *the new Jerusalem* refer to the same thing. They both refer to the heavenly city described in Revelation 21:1–22:5\. In some languages the connection must be made clear in a different way. For example:

> the name of the city of my God, \[which is] new Jerusalem (KJV)

> the name of his city. It is the new Jerusalem (CEV)

#### 3:12e

**that comes down out of heaven from My God),**

* which will descend out of heaven from my God.

#### 3:12f

**and My new name.**

* I will also write my new name on him.
* I will write on you(plur) my new name.

#### 3:12e–f

**that comes down out of heaven from My God:** This clause tells the reader more about the new Jerusalem. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other new Jerusalems and only this one comes *out of heaven*. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about the new Jerusalem. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> It is coming down out of heaven from my God.

**comes:** The BSB, like the Greek, uses the present tense here. This present tense refers generally to the fact that at some time the city will descend. Revelation 21 describes the new Jerusalem descending to the new earth after God judges all people (Rev 20\).

In some languages it is more natural to use the future tense here. For example:

> will come (GNT)

* ¶ “Write this message to the angel representing God’s people who are in the city of Laodicea:

**To the angel of the church in Laodicea write:** You should translate this clause in the same way as you did in 3:1\. Only change the name to *Laodicea*.

#### 3:14b–d

**These are the words of the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the Originator of God’s creation:** This clause is an introduction to the words in 3:15–22\. You should translate the phrase *These are the words of* in a similar way to 3:1\.

Jesus spoke these words about himself. He continues to speak in 3:15 with “I.” In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that Jesus was talking about someone else here. If that is true in your language, indicate that Jesus spoke about himself. For example:

> These are my words, and I am the Amen. I am the faithful and true witness, and I am the source of God’s creation.

#### 3:14b

**These are the words of the Amen,**

* This message is from the One called Amen,
* Here is the message from me, the One named the Amen,
* Here is the message from me, the One Who Says “True!” to God’s promises,

**the Amen:** This phrase is used as a title. The word *Amen* is a Hebrew word that means “even so” or “it is true.” It is used to agree with what was said. Here it indicates that Jesus agrees with all of God’s promises and plans. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the One named the Amen

> the One called Amen (CEV)

> the One Who Says “True!” to God’s promises

This phrase is used as a title for God in Isaiah 65:16 (literally “(the) God of ‘Amen’ ”). There the BSB translates it as “the God of truth.”

See how you translated the word *Amen* in 1:6\.

#### 3:14c

**the faithful and true Witness,**

* the trustworthy and truthful witness,
* the one who witnesses/testifies about God reliably and truthfully,

**the faithful and true Witness:** This phrase indicates that Jesus is someone who is trustworthy and who always speaks the truth. He faithfully declares the things God told him to say. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the witness who is faithful and true (GW)

> the trustworthy, the true witness (NJB)

> the One who faithfully and truthfully testifies about God

See how you translated the similar phrase (“the faithful witness”) in 1:5\.

**faithful:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *faithful* refers to someone trustworthy and dependable. Jesus Christ is reliable and worthy of trust.

**true:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *true* here refers to the fact that Christ is truthful and genuine. He does not misrepresent what God told him to say.

**Witness:** The word *Witness* refers to a person who speaks about something he has seen or heard or knows. Here Jesus is a witness to God and what he wanted Jesus to say.

#### 3:14d

**the Originator of God’s creation.**

* the source of God’s creation. (CEV)
* the origin of all that God made/created.

**the Originator of God’s creation:** There are several ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as *Originator*:

1. It means source or origin. Jesus was the one who created the universe. For example:

    > the origin of all that God has created (GNT)

    > the beginning of God’s creation (RSV) *(BSB, RSV, GNT, NASB, NABRE, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, REB, ESV, NCV, KJV)*

2. It means ruler, as in the NIV. *(NIV, NLT96\)*
3. It means principle. For example:

    > the Principle of God’s creation (NJB) *(NJB)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).Beale (page 301\) speaks of Jesus here as “the inaugurator.” Aune (page 246\) translates the Greek word as “Origin.” This phrase indicates that Jesus was the source or origin of everything that God made. It does not mean that God created Jesus first and then created other things. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the source of God’s creation (GW)

> the originator of God’s creation (NET)

**God’s creation:** The word *creation* refers to all that God has made. This includes the earth, the sun, the stars, people, and all the plants and animals. Jesus himself is not part of this creation but has always existed with God. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> all that God has created/made

> everything that God brought/spoke into existence

#### 3:15a

**I know your deeds;**

* I know your(sing/plur) activities/actions,
* I know the things/deeds that you have done.

**I know your deeds:** Here the Greek word that the BSB translates as *deeds* means “actions” or “activities.” You should translate this clause as you did in 3:8\.

**you:** The Greek pronoun that the BSB translates as *you* is singular. It refers to the angel of the church as the representative of all the believers there.

In many languages it is more natural to use plural pronouns here. If that is true in your language, use plural forms in the following verses to refer to the believers directly. This is the same issue as in 3:8a.

#### 3:15b

**you are neither cold nor hot.**

* that your activities/actions cannot be compared to either cold water or to hot water.
* Your deeds are not useful like hot water is, and neither are they useful like cold water is. You are useless!

**you are neither cold nor hot:** This is a metaphor. It is probably comparing the Laodiceans and their deeds to water. In their culture, *hot* water was useful for certain activities (such as bathing), and *cold* water was useful for other activities (such as drinking). But the believers in Laodicea were not like the *hot* water or the *cold* water. They were not useful for anything.Aune, Beale, Smalley, Johnson, and Osbourne support this interpretation of “cold,” “hot,” and “lukewarm.” Beale (page 303\) says, “‘Neither cold nor hot” but “lukewarm” has traditionally be understood to be metaphorical of their lack of spiritual fervor and halfhearted commitment to Christ. One problem with this is that Christ’s desire that they be either ‘cold or hot’ implies that both extremes are positive. …But it is unlikely that Christ would commend that extreme of complete disloyalty.” Aune (page 257\) says, “‘lukewarm’…is a metaphor for barrenness or ineffectiveness.”

In some languages it is necessary to make the implied comparison with water explicit. It may also be necessary or more natural to translate this metaphor as a simile. For example:

> you are neither like hot water nor like cold water

In some languages a literal translation would not indicate the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > you are neither useful like hot water nor useful like cold water

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > The phrase “neither cold nor hot” uses the metaphor of hot and cold water. Hot water is useful for certain activities, and cold water, for other activities. But the believers in Laodicea were not like the hot water nor the cold water. They were not useful for anything, because their faith bore no fruit (3:17\).

#### 3:15c

**How I wish you were one or the other!**

* It would be better if/that you were either like hot water or like cold water!
* I wish you were useful to me in one way or another!

**How I wish you were one or the other:** This clause refers to the believers being neither cold nor hot as in the metaphor above. In other words, Jesus wished they would act in some useful manner. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> Would that you were cold or hot! (RSV)

> I wish that you were hot or cold! (NCV)

> I wish that you served me in some useful way!

> If only your deeds were as useful as hot water or as useful as cold water.

**How I wish:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *How I wish* introduces an unfulfilled wish. Jesus wanted the believers in Laodicea to be like hot water or cold water, but they were not like either. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> It would be better that

> I wish (NIV)

> If only

**one or the other:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *one or the other* is literally “cold or hot.” In some languages it is more natural to translate the Greek literally. Use the order that is natural in your language. For example:

> cold or hot (RSV)

> hot or cold (NCV)

#### 3:16a–b

**because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to vomit you out of My mouth!:** The word *because* introduces the reason for spitting out the believers of Laodicea. It does not connect back to 3:15\.

In some languages it is more natural to use a conjunction between the two connected clauses. For example:

> you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold, therefore I am about to spit you out of my mouth

#### 3:16a

**So because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—**

* So since you are neither hot nor cold, but only lukewarm,
* Since your deeds are useless, neither like hot water nor like cold water,

**So:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *So* here introduces what Jesus would do because of the deeds of the Laodiceans. What he would do is told in 3:16b.

There is contrast between what the believers in Laodicea did and what Jesus wanted them to do. In some languages it is more natural to make that contrast explicit. For example:

> But (GNT)

Connect this verse to the previous verse in the way that is most natural in your language.

**because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold:** This verse continues the figurative use of “cold” and “hot” of 3:15b–c. Again, in some languages it is more natural to explain the figure of speech. For example:

> since you are like lukewarm water, neither hot nor cold (NLT)

**you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold:** The word *lukewarm* refers to the middle temperature between hot and cold. Here this word implies uselessness (3:15\) or unpleasantness.

Some languages do not have a word for *lukewarm*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Allow the context to indicate the middle temperature and do not translate the word *lukewarm*. For example:

    > you are like water that is neither hot nor cold

    > you are not like hot water or cold water

* Use the implied meaning of “useless.” For example:

    > you are useless—neither hot nor cold

* Use the implied meaning of water that is unpleasant both to drink and to bathe in. For example:

    > you are unpleasant/disgusting, neither hot nor cold

#### 3:16b

**I am about to vomit you out of My mouth!**

* I am ready to forcefully spit you out of my mouth.
* I am about to eject you from my mouth.

**vomit you out of My mouth!:** This phrase is a metaphor. It refers to Jesus rejecting the believers because of their laziness. Jesus rejecting them is like expelling lukewarm water because it tastes bad.

In some languages a literal translation would not indicate the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > reject you like spitting out lukewarm water

    > push you from me like spitting out water that tastes bad

* Translate the meaning without the metaphor. For example:

    > reject you

    > disown you *You may then want a footnote to explain the literal words:*

    > Literally: “vomit/spit you out of my mouth.”

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > This statement indicates that Jesus would reject them because of their laziness and uselessness.

**vomit:** The BSB literally translates this Greek word as *vomit*. This word refers figuratively to Jesus forcefully rejecting them. Because spitting is a voluntary action and “vomit” usually implies an involuntary action, many English versions use the word “spit.” In your translation you should keep the meaning of forceful, deliberate rejection. For example:

> eject/expel

> forcefully spit

The Greek begins with a conjunction that means “because.” It indicates that 3:17a states another reason for Jesus being ready to spit the believers in Laodicea out of his mouth (3:16b). For example:

> For (RSV)

The BSB and some other English versions allow the context to imply the connection and do not translate the Greek conjunction here. Introduce the reason clause in 3:17a in the way that is natural in your language.

**You say, ‘I am rich; I have grown wealthy…’:** As in all the letters to the churches (2:1–3:22\), Jesus spoke here to the angel of the church. The angel represented the believers of the church.

In some languages it is more natural to address the believers directly. If that is true in your language, use plural pronouns here. For example:

> You(plur) say, ‘We(incl) are rich; we have acquired wealth…’

**You say:** Here the believers were probably saying these things to themselves. For example:

> You say to yourself (NJB)

**I am rich; I have grown wealthy:** In the Greek, the first clause uses the noun “rich” and the second clause uses the verb “become rich.” Together, the two clauses emphasize that the Laodiceans were very rich. Other ways to translate these clauses are:

> I am rich and have acquired great wealth (NET)

> I am rich, I have made a fortune (NJB)

**need nothing:** The believers in Laodicea felt like they lacked nothing that they needed for daily living. They had everything. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> do not need a thing (NIV)

> have all I need (GNT)

#### 3:17b–18e

These sentences use physical conditions symbolically to describe spiritual conditions. The English versions translate the sentences literally rather than explaining what the symbols mean. See the translation advice in the notes and the General Comment at 3:18e.

#### 3:17b

**But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked.**

* But you do not understand that you are miserable, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked.
* But you do not know that your spiritual condition is like someone wretched, pathetic, poor, blind, and naked.

**you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked:** These words figuratively describe the spiritual condition of the believers in Laodicea. They were like *wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked* people because they were not trusting and obeying God.

In some languages it is necessary to indicate that Jesus was speaking symbolically. For example:

> spiritually you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked

> your faith is lacking like someone who is wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked

> you believe so little that you are like someone wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked

**wretched:** This word refers to being in an awful and undesirable condition. The GNT translates it as:

> miserable

**pitiful:** This word refers to someone whom others feel sorry for because of all of his difficulties and troubles. Here the word indicates that others should feel sorry for the believers in Laodicea because of these problems in their faith. Other ways to translate this word are:

> pitiable (JBP)

> pathetic

**poor:** This word refers to someone who lacks money and other material things. Spiritually, it describes someone who does not possess God’s spiritual blessings and riches. The believers in Laodicea had a lot of money and possessions, but they were “poor” in their faith.

**blind:** Someone who is physically *blind* is unable to see physical things. Someone who is spiritually blind is unable to understand spiritual things.

**naked:** This word refers to someone who is not wearing any clothes at all. Spiritually, it describes someone who does not use the qualities that God gives to believers to do his work.

* **Associated Passages:** REV 3:17

## Revelation 3:18 (id: 522769)

### Section 3:14–22: Jesus spoke to the church at Laodicea

In this section, Jesus spoke to the people who believed in him at Laodicea. He knew that they believed in him but they were not serving him well. He warned them to stop being lazy and encouraged them to work properly for him. Lastly, he gave a promise to any believer who persevered in his faith.

Translate this section heading as you did for the other messages to the churches.

#### 3:18a–e

Jesus advised the believers in Laodicea to buy three things: gold, white clothes, and salve. These three things are symbolic of spiritual things such as faith, righteousness, and spiritual guidance/sight.

#### 3:18a

**I counsel you to buy from Me gold refined by fire**

* I advise you to buy gold refined by fire from me
* I recommend you to buy from me true/real wealth/riches, pure/purest gold,

**counsel:** This word means “give advice.” Jesus told the believers what they should do to improve their weak spiritual condition. The GNT translates the Greek word as:

> advise

**buy from Me gold refined by fire:** This command symbolically refers to obtaining true, spiritual riches from God. The believers in Laodicea needed to ask Jesus for the only kind of wealth that is truly valuable. See the General Comment at the end of 3:18e.

**gold:** The word *gold* refers to a rare metal of a somewhat yellow color. It was the most expensive metal at that time. Gold is naturally shiny and beautiful.

In some languages people are not familiar with *gold*. If that is true in your language, you may want to describe it. For example:

> expensive gold

> valuable metal/stones called gold

See how you translated a similar word (“golden”) in 1:12\.

**refined by fire:** When someone makes gold so hot that it melts, the impurities in the gold float to the top. Then the impurities can be removed. In that way gold is made pure, or it is *refined*. The verb *refined* is an implied passive clause. Some ways to translate it are:

* Use a passive clause. For example:

    > It has been refined in a fire, (CEV)

    > gold made pure in fire (NCV)

* Use an active clause. For example:

    > that the fire has purified

#### 3:18b

**so that you may become rich,**

* so you can become wealthy,
* so that you are able to become truly rich in your faith.

**that you may become rich:** This clause refers figuratively to having spiritual riches such as great faith. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer only to earthly riches. If that is true in your language, explain the kind of riches in your translation. For example:

> you can be truly rich (NCV)

> then you will have spiritual wealth

Another way to help readers understand this figurative speech is to translate literally but explain that meaning in a footnote. See the example footnote in the General Comment at 3:18e.

#### 3:18c

**white garments so that you may be clothed**

* and white clothing to wear
* And I advise/instruct you to buy from me white clothes to wear as a symbol of purity,

**white garments:** The main clause “I counsel you to buy from me” is implied. The Greek language does not need to repeat it here. However, in some languages it is more natural to repeat some or all of the main clause. For example:

> and buy from me white clothes to wear

> and I counsel you to buy from me white clothes to wear

The phrase *white garments* probably refers figuratively to righteousness or goodness. Moral goodness (or righteousness) is sometimes symbolized by white clothes in the Bible.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer only to their literal clothing. If that is true in your language, you may want to include the implied meaning in your translation. For example:

> white clothes that represent righteousness/purity

Another way to help readers understand this figurative speech is to translate literally but explain that meaning in a footnote. See the example footnote in the General Comment at 3:18e.

#### 3:18d

**and your shameful nakedness not exposed,**

* so the shame of your nakedness will not be revealed/seen,
* so that you can prevent/stop others from seeing your shameful nakedness.
* so that you can spiritually be like someone who has covered his shameful nakedness from others.

**that you may be clothed and your shameful nakedness not exposed:** The Greek clause is literally “so that the shame of your nakedness will not be revealed.” This is a negative purpose statement with a passive clause with “be revealed.” Some ways to translate it are:

* Use a passive clause. For example:

    > so…your shameful nakedness will not be exposed (NET)

    > and the shame of your nakedness may not be seen (ESV)

    > so you will not be shamed by your nakedness (NLT)

* Use an active clause. For example:

    > hide your shameful nakedness (NJB)

    > so that you may keep your shameful, naked body from showing (GW)

**your shameful nakedness:** The Greek phrase is literally “the shame of your nakedness” (as in the RSV). Nakedness is a symbol for their lack of righteousness. White clothing is a symbol for righteousness. They needed to remedy their lack of righteousness (their “nakedness”). Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> be shamed by your nakedness (NLT)

> the shame of being naked

#### 3:18e

**and salve to anoint your eyes so that you may see.**

* and ointment to rub on your eyes so you can see.
* And I advise/instruct you to buy from me salve to put on your eyes, so that you can see spiritual things.

**and salve to anoint your eyes so that you may see:** The third thing Jesus told the believers in Laodicea to accept from him was eye *salve*. He wanted to give them true sight, that is, spiritual understanding.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer only to literal salve. If that is true in your language, you may want to include the implied meaning in your translation. For example:

> and salve that represents the healing power of God to see spiritual needs to put on your eyes, so you can see

**salve:** This word refers to an ointment put on the eyes to help heal eye diseases. Here the salve would heal the spiritual blindness mentioned in 3:17b. Other ways to translate this word are:

> ointment (GNT)

> medicine

**to anoint your eyes:** Translate this phrase by using the natural way to talk about applying medicine to eyes. For example:

> to put in your eyes

> for your eyes (CEV)

##### **General Comment on 3:17b–18e**

Symbols in this long metaphor refer to spiritual conditions, so you may want to translate them literally and then explain the metaphors in a footnote. An example footnote is:

> The physical conditions referred to in 3:17b–18 are symbols for a person’s spiritual condition. The faith of the believers at Laodicea was wretched and pitiful. They were spiritually poor, blind, and naked. The gold, eye salve, and clothes are symbolic remedies for being spiritually poor, blind, and naked. The physical remedies represent spiritual blessings like pure faith, knowledge of God, and righteousness.

**Those I love, I rebuke and discipline.**

* It is those whom I love that I rebuke and discipline.
* I correct and discipline those whom I love.

**Those I love, I rebuke and discipline:** The phrase *Those I love* is emphasized in the Greek and the BSB. If possible, emphasize this phrase naturally in your language.

In some languages it is more natural to put this clause in its usual place. For example:

> I rebuke and discipline those whom I love

**love:** This word refers to active concern for another’s well\-being.

**rebuke:** This word refers here to telling someone that they have sinned and need to repent. Other ways to translate this word are:

> reprove (RSV)

> correct (GW)

**discipline:** This word refers to training or punishing someone who has sinned. The goal of *discipline* is for that person to stop sinning and do things the correct way. Other ways to translate this word are:

> chasten (RSV)

> punish (GNT)

> train (NJB)

#### 3:19b

**Therefore be earnest and repent.**

* So be(sing/plur) eager to do right and repent.
* So be diligent and change your thinking!

**be earnest:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *be earnest* refers to being eager or diligent to do something. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> be diligent (NLT)

> be eager (NCV)

**repent:** See how you translated this word in 2:5 or 3:3\.

Translate this section heading as you did for the other messages to the churches.

#### 3:20a–c

This verse is a metaphor for Jesus seeking the attention of the believers who are distracted. They have not been obeying or following him well. He wants to renew or continue the relationship he has with them.

#### 3:20a

**Behold, I stand at the door and knock.**

* Look/Indeed, I have been standing at the door and knocking.
* Indeed/Hey, I am standing at the door, requesting entrance.

**Behold:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Behold* is literally “look.” The word emphasizes or calls attention to the words that follow. The word is not a command to look at something. Other ways to translate this Greek word are:

> Indeed/Hey,

> Look,

> Listen! (GNT)

**I stand at the door and knock:** The Greek grammar probably indicates that Jesus arrived at the door earlier, started knocking, and is still knocking. For example:

> I am standing at the door, knocking (NJB)

**knock:** Here the word *knock* means “request entrance.” Jesus wanted to enter their home. As 3:20b indicates, Jesus also calls to the person inside.

In some languages it is more natural to include the implied action here. For example:

> knock and call/speak

If the word *knock* has a different meaning than “request entrance” in your language, you should use the word or phrase in your language that means “request entrance.”

#### 3:20b

**If anyone hears My voice and opens the door,**

* If anyone hears me and opens the door,
* When one of you hears me calling and opens the door to me,

**If anyone hears My voice:** This clause implies that Jesus spoke loud enough so that the person inside the house could hear him. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> If you hear me calling (NLT96\)

> If there is someone who hears MeUma Back Translation on TW.

#### 3:20c

**I will come in and dine with him, and he with Me.**

* then I will enter, and he and I will eat together.
* I will come in, and we will eat together.

**dine with him, and he with Me:** These clauses indicates a mutual relationship. Jesus and the believer eat together, talk together, and share with each other. For example:

> share a meal at that person’s side (NJB)

##### **General Comment on 3:20b–c**

The Greek words change from second person (“you(sing)”) in 3:15–19 to third person (“he/she”) at 3:20b. But Jesus was still speaking to those who were spiritually poor, blind, and naked. In some languages it is more natural to continue using second person here. For example:

> If any of you hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with you, and you with me

He saw the vision of an angel and a small scroll (chapter 10\). He saw the vision of two witnesses and the results of the seventh trumpet being blown (chapter 11\). He saw the vision of a woman and a dragon (chapter 12\). He saw the vision of two beasts (chapter 13\). He saw the vision of 144,000 believers and the vision of the earth harvested (chapter 14\). He saw the vision of the seven bowls (chapters 15–16\). John heard the prophecy about Babylon and the prophecy about the wedding of the Lamb (chapter 17–19\). He heard the prophecy about Jesus reigning as king and the prophecy about Satan’s last rebellion (20:1–10\). He saw the vision of God judging the dead (20:11–15\).

**After this I looked and saw**

* ¶ After those things/words ended I looked,
* ¶ Then as I looked, (NLT)

**After this I looked:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *this* is plural: “these (things).” The word refers to the messages to the churches (chapters 2–3\) and probably the first vision (1:10–20\) as well. Other ways to translate this phrase here are:

> After these things I looked (NASB)

> Then as I looked (NLT)

> When those messages were finished, I looked around/up

#### 4:1a–b

**I looked and saw a door standing open in heaven:** The Greek words are literally “I saw, and look, a door in heaven, already opened already/earlier.” The phrase “and look” emphasizes or calls attention to the words that follow. The phrase “a door in heaven, already opened” describes what John saw. Other ways to translate this statement are:

> I suddenly/unexpectedly saw something else! It was a door which was open into heaven

> as I looked, wow, I saw an opening into heaven

> Another vision appeared before/to me. I saw a doorway opened into heaven

> I had another vision and saw an open door in heaven (GNT)

#### 4:1b

**a door standing open in heaven.**

* and listen/hey, I saw an open door in heaven.
* and wow, I saw in the sky an opening/entrance into heaven.

**a door standing open in heaven:** The open door allowed John to see into heaven and perhaps even to enter it. The voice said “Come up here.” This implies that the door was somewhere up in the sky, not down on the ground. For example:

> a door that opened into heaven (CEV)

> an entrance in the sky which was open

**a door standing open:** This phrase refers to an opening shaped like a door in the sky. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> open door (RSV)

> entrance

> doorway

**And the voice I had previously heard speak to me like a trumpet was saying,**

* And the voice speaking like a trumpet spoke again, saying,
* Then the same loud voice that sounded like a trumpet spoke to me again. It said,

**the voice I had previously heard speak to me like a trumpet was saying:** The clause *the voice I had previously heard speak to me like a trumpet* refers to what happened earlier. In some languages it is more natural to use a separate sentence. For example:

> I heard the voice like a trumpet that spoke to me previously. This time it said…

> Earlier I had heard a trumpet\-like voice speaking to me. Now it spoke to me again and said…

**the voice I had previously heard speak to me like a trumpet:** This phrase refers to the voice that John heard in 1:10\. See how you translated “a loud voice like a trumpet” there.

**the voice…speak to me like a trumpet:** This phrase describes what the voice sounded like to John. Other ways to translate the phrase are:

> the person whose voice sounded like a trumpet

> the person with the trumpet\-like voice

* and I will show to you the things/events that are required to happen after this time.”
* and I will show to you(sing) what will certainly occur/happen in the future.”

**what must happen:** The Greek words are literally “the things necessary to happen.” The events in chapters 4–22 will certainly happen, because God requires them to happen. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the things that will certainly happen

> the things which will necessarily occur

> has been determined to happen

See how you translated a similar phrase (“what must…come to pass”) in 1:1\.

**after these things:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *these things* is literally “these (things).” It refers to the things that John was shown in chapters 1–3\. For example:

**At once I was in the Spirit,**

* Immediately, I became inspired again by the Spirit,
* At once, I came under the Spirit’s power.
* At once, I became well\-connected to the Holy Spirit.

**At once I was in the Spirit:** The Greek clause is literally “Immediately I was in spirit.” John’s experience of being “in spirit” continues from 1:10, but John feels it anew.Some scholars, such as Kistemaker (page 184\), say that this clause indicates a renewal of the “in spirit” experience. Other scholars such as Smalley (page 114\) say that this clause intensifies the “in spirit” experience. Translate the phrase *in the Spirit* similarly to the way that you did there. For example:

> Again I was in the Spirit

> At once I found myself again in the Spirit

> Again the Spirit began speaking to my spirit

**and I saw a throne standing in heaven, with someone seated on it.**

* and I saw a throne standing/there in heaven. Someone was sitting on it.
* I saw a place/seat of ruling in heaven and the great/greatest One sitting there.

**and I saw:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *and I saw* is literally “look.” The word emphasizes or calls attention to the words that follow. The word “look” is not a command to look at something. Other ways to translate the Greek phrase are:

> indeed/hey,

> suddenly/unexpectedly

**a throne:** A *throne* is the official chair where a king sits. From his throne, he rules his people and his country. Therefore, the word *throne* is a symbol for the authority the king has to rule. This *throne* is God’s throne, because he rules heaven.

See how you translated this word in 1:4\.

**in heaven:** Here the Greek word that the BSB translates as *heaven* refers to the place where God lives. Some languages do not have a word for this place. If that is true in your language, you may need to:

* Use a word that can refer figuratively to the place where God lives. For example:

    > sky

    > the place beyond the stars

* Use the major language word. If people from your language are not familiar with the meaning of this word, you may want to include a footnote to explain it:

    > Heaven is the place where God lives.

* Translate it using a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > the place where God lives

**with someone seated on it:** Here the word *someone* is general, but it refers to God. By not naming God, this phrase emphasizes that the person sitting on the throne has all the authority that the main throne in heaven symbolizes. John may also be copying the style of the Old Testament prophets in not naming God.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer to someone other than God. If that is true in your language, translate in a way that clearly refers to God. If possible, speak indirectly of God. For example:

> with the one who rules everything sitting on it

> with the great/greatest One sitting there

But in some languages speaking indirectly about God will still be unclear. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Translate literally and put in a footnote to explain the meaning. An example footnote is:

    > This refers to God.

    > The word “someone” refers to God here.

* Speak directly about God. For example:

    > with God himself sitting on it

**The One seated there looked like jasper and carnelian,**

* The one sitting on it looked as shiny/brilliant as the gemstones jasper and carnelian.
* He shone like the stones/jewels jasper and carnelian,

**The One seated there looked like jasper and carnelian:** These verses do not say how God *looked like jasper and carnelian*. It probably indicates that God shone colorfully and brightly, shining like those stones do. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> The one sitting on the throne was as brilliant as gemstones—like jasper and carnelian. (NLT)

> The one who was sitting there sparkled like precious stones of jasper and carnelian. (CEV)

**jasper:** This name in Greek is spelled *iaspis*. This word refers to a spotted or veined stone of a variety of colors. It is often a reddish color, but can also be deep green, brown, or deep yellow. It shines brightly in the sun when polished. Light reflects off its surface. Light does not shine through this stone as it does through glass. One example of *jasper* is:

People of some languages are not familiar with *jasper*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use the name for a kind of stone similar to how *jasper* is described above. The important thing is that it should be considered bright and beautiful.

Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

> a shiny, spotted/veined stone named jasper

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Jasper is a spotted or veined stone that is deep red, green, or yellow. It shines brightly.

**carnelian:** This word refers to a blood\-red stone that shines brightly in the sun when polished. Light reflects off the surface of this stone also.

* and a rainbow looking like it was made of emerald encircled the throne. (NET)

**and a rainbow that gleamed like an emerald encircled the throne:** These verses do not say how the rainbow resembled an emerald. It probably refers to a ring of green light that circled around the throne. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> round the throne was a rainbow that looked like an emerald (RSV)

> all around the throne there was a rainbow the color of an emerald (GNT)

**emerald:** This word refers to a bright green precious stone that shines brightly in the sun. Light shines through this stone as it does through glass.

In some languages people are not familiar with an *emerald*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > a clear green stone/gem named emerald

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > An emerald is a bright green precious stone that light can shine through.

### Section 4:1–11: John saw the throne in heaven

In this section, John told more about the vision that he saw, using language similar to 1:10\. In his vision he saw in the sky an opening into heaven. He could see God on his throne and different beings worshiping God.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The vision of the throne in heaven

> A vision of God’s throne in heaven (GW)

#### 4:4a

**Surrounding the throne were twenty\-four other thrones,**

* Around the throne in a circle were twenty\-four other thrones,
* Twenty\-four thrones encircled God’s throne,

**Surrounding the throne were twenty\-four other thrones:** This clause probably indicates that the *twenty\-four other thrones* were arranged in a circle around God’s throne. For example:

> In a circle around the throne were twenty\-four other thrones (GNT)

**twenty\-four other thrones:** The BSB adds the word *other* to show that God’s throne is not included when John counted the *twenty\-four…thrones*. Indicate this in a natural way in your language.

#### 4:4b

**and on these thrones sat twenty\-four elders**

* and on the thrones sat twenty\-four elders.
* and on each of these thrones, a leader was sitting.

**and on these thrones sat twenty\-four elders:** The Greek clause is literally “and on the thrones twenty\-four elders sitting.” This clause probably emphasizes the phrase “on the thrones.” Consider how to emphasize this phrase in your language. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> and seated on the thrones were twenty\-four elders (RSV)

> upon the thrones I saw twenty\-four elders sitting (NASB)

> on these thrones sat 24 leaders (GW)

One elder was sitting on each throne. For example:

> And on each of these thrones there was an elder (CEV)

In some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. For example:

> Twenty\-four elders were sitting on these thrones….

**elders:** Here the Greek word that the BSB translates as *elders* refers to people or other beings who have authority. For example:

> leaders (GW)

These verses do not say whether the elders were people, angels, or some other being. So you should use a general word that can refer to either human beings or spirit beings such as angels.

#### 4:4c

**dressed in white,**

* They wore white clothes/garments
* The leaders wore white clothing,

**dressed in white:** The Greek clause here is literally “having been clothed in white garments.” The Greek word for “garments” is a general word for clothing. The BSB and many other English versions leave the kind of clothing implied. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> clad in white garments (RSV)

> wearing white clothes (GW)

See how you translated a similar clause in 3:4 (“in white”).

#### 4:4d

**with golden crowns on their heads.**

* and wore golden crowns on their heads.
* and each leader wore a headpiece/hat of authority made of gold.

**golden crowns:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *crowns* can refer to two kinds of headgear. It can refer to a wreath worn as a sign of victory over competitors, as in 2:10e or 3:11c. But here it probably refers to the kind of crowns that kings wore. One example of a crown is:

Here the *crowns* of the elders are a symbol of leadership, like the *crowns* of kings. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> headpieces/hats of rulers made of gold

> gold headdresses like kings/leaders wear

**golden:** Something which is *golden* is made of a shiny, yellow metal called “gold,” which is very valuable. In some languages people are not familiar with things which are *golden*. If that is true in your language, you may want to describe it. For example:

> expensive gold

> valuable metal/stones called gold

See how you translated the word “gold” in 3:18\.

### Section 4:1–11: John saw the throne in heaven

In this section, John told more about the vision that he saw, using language similar to 1:10\. In his vision he saw in the sky an opening into heaven. He could see God on his throne and different beings worshiping God.

#### 4:5a

**From the throne came flashes of lightning, and rumblings, and peals of thunder.**

* Out of the throne came lightning, rumbling/rolling thunder, and crashes of thunder.
* Lightning flashed, storm noises resounded, and thunder boomed loudly from the throne.

**From the throne:** The word *From* indicates that the source of the lightning and thunder is the throne.

**flashes of lightning:** This phrase refers to the bright streaks of light in the sky. This *lightning* often occurs during a thunderstorm. Another way to translate this phrase is:

> lightnings (KJV)

**and rumblings:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *rumblings* has several possible meanings. There are three ways to interpret it:

1. It refers to the “rolling” sound of thunder and probably also the wind. (The next phrase, “peals of thunder,” refers to loud crashes of thunder.) For example:

    > noises (NCV) *(BSB, NIV, GNT, NRSV, NASB, NABRE, NET, GW, ESV, NCV)*

2. It refers to heavenly voices. For example:

    > voices (RSV) *(RSV, KJV)*

3. It refers to the sound of the thunder mentioned next in the list. Thus there are only two, rather than three, things coming from the throne. For example:

    > Flashes of lightning were coming from the throne, and the sound of peals of thunder (NJB) *(NJB, REB, NLT, CEV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).Aune (page 268\) translates the Greek word as “rumbling.” Beale (page 326\) translates the phrase as “lightnings and sounds and thunders,” which does not clearly support interpretation (1\) but rules out interpretations (2\) and (3\).

**peals of thunder:** This phrase refers to the loud booming noises of *thunder*. They accompany lightning during a storm. It can also be translated as:

> crashes of thunder (NET)

> roars/booms of thunder

#### 4:5b

**Before the throne burned seven torches of fire.**

* Seven fiery torches were burning in front of the throne,
* And seven flaming torches burned before the throne.

**burned seven torches of fire:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *torches of fire* is more literally “lamps of fire.” This phrase probably refers to sticks having burning material at one end. In English, these are often called “torches.” See the drawing below. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> seven lighted torches were burning (GNT)

> Seven flaming torches were burning (GW)

#### 4:5c

**These are the seven Spirits of God.**

* which are the seven spirits of God.
* Those torches represent/symbolize the sevenfold Spirit of God.

**These are the seven Spirits of God:** John introduced the symbolic meaning of the seven torches with the word *are*. In many languages, a literal translation is natural. For example:

> which are the seven spirits of God (RSV)

In some languages it is more natural to clearly indicate that the seven torches are symbolic. For example:

> These torches represent the seven spirits of God

**the seven Spirits of God:** Many scholars believe that the phrase *the seven Spirits* is a symbolic reference to the Holy Spirit. Other scholars believe that the phrase refers to seven angels or to seven other spirits who serve God. See how you translated this phrase in 1:4 or 3:1\.

If you used a footnote to explain *the seven Spirits* at 1:4e, you may want to:

* Refer your readers to the footnote on *the seven Spirits* at 1:4\. For example:

    > See footnote on “the seven spirits” at 1:4\.

* Repeat all or most of the footnote at 1:4e here.

**And before the throne was something like a sea of glass, as clear as crystal.**

* Also in front of the throne was something like a sea of glass, which was like a crystal.
* Also something spread before the throne that resembled a sea made of/from glass. It was bright/sparkling/transparent like crystal.

**was something like a sea of glass:** This clause indicates that John saw something that was like a *sea*. A *sea* is a large body of water that is many kilometers wide. The *sea* that John saw may have been solid like glass or liquid like water. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> there is something like a sea of glass (NRSV)

> something resembling a sea of glass

> something spread out like a sea of glass

**a sea of glass:** The sea could be made *of glass*. Or it could be made of something flat and shiny like water that is perfectly smooth. In that way it looked smooth and clear like glass.

**as clear as crystal:** The Greek words only indicate that the sea of glass was “like crystal” (as in the RSV). The comparison to *crystal* probably indicates that John could see through the sea in the way that someone can see through *clear* water. So the BSB and some other English versions add the word *clear*. But “as crystal” may instead refer to it being shiny or flat or angled (rather than rounded).

**crystal:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *crystal* refers to various substances that are bright, shiny, and have flat surfaces. The Greek word probably refers only to crystals that let light shine through them. Salt and ice are crystals, but here it is probably crystals as hard or harder than stone that are implied. Quartz, diamonds, and sapphires are examples of hard crystals.

Here the focus is on the fact that crystals are shiny and let light shine through them.

In some languages people are not familiar with crystals. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use the characteristics of crystals that are important here. For example:

    > bright/sparkling, flat, and clear

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, you may want to explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Crystals are hard substances that are see\-through, shiny, and have flat surfaces.

#### 4:6b

**In the center, around the throne, were four living creatures,**

* ¶ Surrounding the throne were four living beings,
* ¶ Four living creatures stood near the throne.

**In the center:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *In the center* is literally “in the middle/midst of the throne.” Since God is sitting on the throne, this phrase probably refers to the middle of the throne area. It indicates that the four living creatures were near or next to the throne of God. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> In the center near the throne (GW)

> Close to the throne

**around the throne:** The living creatures were *around the throne*, perhaps:

1. one at each corner,
2. two on the right side and two on the left side,
3. one in back and one in front and one on each side.

Use a general phrase like *around the throne*. This allows for one or more of the above meanings.

**four living creatures:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *living creatures* is literally “living (ones).” They are beings like angels, cherubim (Ezekiel 1\), or seraphim (Isaiah 6\). In John’s vision, some of these beings look like various animals (4:7\). However, they are able to speak and praise God (4:8\). Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> four living beings (NLT)

> four living things/ones

#### 4:6c

**covered with eyes in front and back.**

* full of eyes in front and behind. (RSV)
* They had eyes all over them, both in front and back.

**covered with eyes in front and back:** These creatures had eyes all over their whole bodies. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> full of eyes in front and behind (RSV)

> each covered with eyes, front and back (NLT)

> with eyes all over them, in front and in back (NCV)

**The first living creature was like a lion,**

* The first living being was similar to a lion,
* The first one looked like a lion. (GNT)

**The first living creature was like a lion:** This first *creature* looked like a lion.

**a lion:** A *lion* is a large, fierce, four\-legged animal. They weigh about 200 kilograms (450 pounds) and are about 2 meters (6\.5 feet) in length. They prey upon and eat other animals, sometimes animals bigger than themselves. The male lion has a mane of hair on the head and neck. The female lion does not have a mane. A drawing of a male lion is:

If lions are not known in your area, you may want to:

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > A lion is a large, fierce, four\-legged animal. A lion weighs about 200 kilograms and is about two meters in length.

* Use the major language word and add a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > a large, fierce animal called a lion

#### 4:7b

**the second like a calf,**

* the second living being was similar to an ox,
* The second one looked like a bull.

**the second like a calf:** This second creature looked like a calf. The word “creature” is implied from 4:7a, but it is not repeated here.

**second:** The word *second* refers to the next item after the first one. If counted, this item would be counted as number two. Other ways to translate this word are:

> the one after the first

> another

**a calf:** A *calf* is the offspring of cattle or oxen. Mature oxen weigh about 800 kilograms (1,800 pounds) and are about 2\.4 meters (8 feet) in length. They eat grass. A drawing of one kind of ox is:

The Greek word that the BSB translates as *calf* can also refer to full\-grown cattle. For example, the NIV says:

> an ox

A calf would not have horns. It is not clear here whether a young or mature ox is meant.

If calves (the plural of *calf*) are not known in your area, you may want to:

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > A calf is a young cow (female) or bull (male). Cows and bulls are large, domesticated/tame four\-legged animals. They weigh about 800 kilograms and are about 2\.4 meters in length when they are full grown.

* Use the major language word and add a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > a large animal called a calf

#### 4:7c

**the third had a face like a man,**

* the third living being had a face similar to a face of a man,
* The third one had a face like a human face.

**the third had a face like a man:** The face of the third creature looked like a human being. The rest of the third creature is not described. The word “creature” is implied from 4:7a, but it is not repeated here.

**third:** This refers to the next item after the second one. If counted, this item would be counted as number three. Other ways to translate this word are:

> the one after the other two

> the one after the two of them

> another beside the other two

#### 4:7d

**and the fourth was like an eagle in flight.**

* and the fourth living being was similar to a flying eagle.
* The fourth one looked like an eagle in flight.

**the fourth was like an eagle in flight:** This fourth creature looked like an eagle that was flying. The word “creature” is implied from 4:7a, but it is not repeated.

**fourth:** The word *fourth* refers to the next item after three other things. If counted, this item would be counted as number four. Here it refers to the last of four living creatures. Other ways to translate this word here are:

> the one after the other three

> the one after the three of them

> last

**an eagle in flight:** An *eagle* is a large, sometimes aggressive bird. They weigh about 5 kilograms (11 pounds) and are about 1 meter (3 feet) in length. They eat meat. A drawing of one kind of eagle is:

If eagles are not known in your area, you may want to:

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > An eagle is a large, meat\-eating bird. It weighs about 5 kilograms and is about one meter in length.

* Use the major language word and add a descriptive phrase. For example:

#### 4:8a

**And each of the four living creatures had six wings**

* Each of the four living beings had six wings,

**And each of the four living creatures had six wings:** The *four living creatures* each had wings like birds. But these *creatures* had six wings each. Each one probably had three wings on each side of its body.

#### 4:8b

**and was covered with eyes all around and within.**

* full of eyes all around and underneath their wings.
* and there were many eyes on and underneath their wings.

**and was covered with eyes all around and within:** The Greek clause is literally “they are full of eyes around and within.” There are two likely ways to interpret the word “within” here:

1. It indicates that the eyes were on the body under the closed wings.
2. It indicates that the eyes were on the underside of the opened wings.

Many of the English versions are ambiguous. These verses do not say whether the wings were raised or folded next to the body. If possible, translate this clause in a way that implies or indicates either interpretation (1\) or (2\). For example:

> they were covered with eyes, inside and out (GNT)

> their bodies were covered with eyes (CEV)

> their bodies and the underside of their wings were covered with eyes

#### 4:8c

**Day and night they never stop saying:**

* Day and night they keep on saying,
* They continually repeat/chant in unison,

**Day and night:** The phrase *Day and night* indicates the creatures spoke the words of 4:8d–e all the time.

**they never stop saying:** The four creatures repeated the same words over and over again. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> they do not cease to say (NASB)

> they keep on saying (NLT)

**saying:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *saying* is the normal Greek word for speaking. However, the creatures are all speaking 4:8d–e in unison. For example:

> saying together

> chanting

#### 4:8d–e

4:8d–e are like two lines of a chant or two lines of poetry. You may want to print these lines separately to show that they are a chant or poem.

#### 4:8d

**“Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord God Almighty,**

* “The Lord God Almighty is holy, he is holy, indeed he is holy,
* “The Lord God, the all mighty/powerful one, is completely/utterly holy/sacred.

**Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord God Almighty:** The words *Holy, Holy, Holy* is emphasized in the Greek and in the BSB. If possible, emphasize this phrase naturally in your language.

The word *Holy* is repeated in order to emphasize its meaning. Consider how to emphasize the words as in a poem or chant in your language. For example:

> Holy is the Lord God Almighty! Holy is he! Holy is he!

> The Lord God Almighty is holy, holy, holy!

> The Lord God Almighty is holy, indeed he is completely holy!

**Holy:** Here the word *Holy* indicates that God is perfect and unique. He only does what is right. He is different from all other beings since they are not perfect nor unique. Other ways to translate this word are:

> sacred/divine

> pure/perfect spiritually/morally

> unique/separate

See how you translated this word in 3:7\.

**the Lord:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *the Lord* means “the one who has authority over (something),” or “owner.” God is master or owner of everything. See how you translated this word in 1:8\.

**Almighty:** This word is a title which means “the one with the power to do anything.” For example:

> the All\-Powerful (NET)

See how you translated this word in 1:8\.

#### 4:8e

**who was and is and is to come!”**

* and he was and is and is coming.”
* He is the one who has always existed, and who exists now, and who is to come.”

**who was and is and is to come!:** All these words refer to God and emphasize that God is eternal and will come and do what he wants to do. Other ways to translate it are:

> He was, he is, and he is coming (NCV)

> he who always existed, who exists, and who is coming

See how you translated these words in 1:4 or 1:8\. Note that the order is different there: “who is and was and is to come.”

**is to come!:** This phrase indicates that God will come and do as he promised. It is not a substitute way to say “will be.” For example:

> he is coming (NCV)

**And whenever the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks**

* Whenever the living beings glorify and honor/respect and thank
* Each time the living beings praise/acknowledge his majesty, revere, and thank

**And whenever the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks:** This clause refers to what the creatures were saying in 4:8\. By saying these words of praise, they were giving *glory, honor, and thanks* to God.

**give glory, honor, and thanks:** This phrase indicates that the creatures acknowledge God’s glory, that they honor him and thank him. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> glorify and honor and thank

> praising, honoring, and thanking (CEV)

**give glory:** This phrase refers to agreeing that God has glory. The living creatures do that by praising God. They say that he is great, and that he has all power and majesty. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> acknowledge his majesty

> praise him that he is awesome

**give…honor:** This phrase refers to showing respect and reverence to someone. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> revere

> show respect

> lift up the name

#### 4:9b

**to the One seated on the throne who lives forever and ever,**

* him who sits on the throne and who lives for all time,
* the eternal living one sitting on the throne,

**to the One seated on the throne who lives forever and ever:** The two phrases *to the One seated on the throne* and (him) *who lives forever and ever* both refer to God.

Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> to him who sits on the throne, that is, the one who lives for ever and ever

> the one who sits on the throne, who lives for ever and ever (CEV)

> to the forever existing one who sits on the throne

**who lives forever and ever:** The Greek words are literally “to the one living into the ages of the ages.” The word “age” refers to a very long time, so the phrase “the ages of the ages” refers to eternity. For example:

> who lives for evermore

> who lives for all ages to come

#### 4:10a

**the twenty\-four elders fall down before the One seated on the throne,**

* the twenty\-four elders prostrate themselves in front of him who sits on the throne,
* the twenty\-four leaders kneel and put their faces to the ground with their arms outstretched before the forever living one who sits on the throne,

**fall down:** Here the phrase *fall down* refers to kneeling and putting the face to the ground with arms outstretched toward someone. This position showed complete humility before that person and honored him. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> prostrated themselves (NJB)

> throw themselves to the ground (NET)

Some languages have a different action that shows complete humility and honor to someone. If that is true in your language, you may want to use that action here. See how you translated this phrase in 3:9, where the BSB translates it as “bow down.”

#### 4:10b

**and they worship Him who lives forever and ever.**

* and worship/honor him who lives for all time.
* revere him,

**and they worship Him who lives forever and ever:** The elders worshiped the one before whom they had fallen down. See the General Comment on 4:10a–b below.

**worship:** This word refers to honoring someone or something as sacred/divine. Other ways to translate this word are:

> venerate

> revere

If possible, refer to your translation of this word in Matthew 2:2, Luke 4:8, or 1 Corinthians 14:25\.

##### **General Comment on 4:10a–b**

The phrase “fall down before the One seated on the throne” (4:10a) refers to worshiping God. The phrase “worship Him who lives for ever and ever” (4:10b) also refers to worshiping God. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly imply or indicate that these two phrases refer to worshiping two different people. If that is true in your language, you may want to combine the two phrases into one phrase. For example:

> the twenty\-four elders fall down before the forever\-living one who sits on the throne, and they worship him

#### 4:10c

**They cast their crowns before the throne, saying:**

* They place their crowns before the throne and say,
* and take off their headpieces/hats of authority to place them before the throne. They repeat/chant in unison,

**They cast their crowns before the throne, saying:** The elders do this during their worship (4:10b). In some languages it is more natural to connect 4:10c to their worship. For example:

> and threw down their crowns in front of the throne, saying (NJB)

> 10bworship him who lives forever and ever, 10claying their crowns before the throne and saying

**crowns:** The *crowns* of the elders are a symbol of leadership, just like the *crowns* of kings. Translate this word as you did in 4:4\.

**saying:** They probably all spoke in unison. So, as in 4:8c, you may want to translate this word as:

> say together

> chant

**“Worthy are You, our Lord and God,**

* “Our(incl) Lord and God, you(sing) are worthy
* “Our Lord/Master and God, you indeed deserve

**Worthy are You, our Lord and God:** In some languages it is more natural to address God first. For example:

> Our Lord and God, you are worthy

**Worthy are You:** The word *Worthy* indicates that God deserves to receive all glory, and honor, and power. It is right and proper that the elders should give him their respect, honor him, and acknowledge his power and glory. For example:

> you deserve (GW)

**Worthy:** In the Greek, the word *Worthy* is emphasized. If possible, emphasize it in your language. For example:

> Worthy are You (BSB, NASB)

> You are indeed worthy

#### 4:11b

**to receive glory and honor and power,**

* to be glorified and honored and praised for your might,
* that everyone should revere you and praise you for your majesty and strength,
* to have people/everyone praise your greatness/majesty, show you respect, and acknowledge your power,

**to receive glory and honor and power:** This phrase refers to anyone praising and honoring God. God accepts that praise and honor. The living creatures, the elders, and others praise God’s *glory* and *power*. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> for people/everyone to glorify you and honor you and praise your power

> that we acknowledge your majesty and your power and we revere you

> that all beings praise your greatness and show you respect and praise you as the powerful/mighty one

**receive…power:** Here this phrase refers to being praised for one’s power. People praise God for being the all powerful God.

**glory and honor:** See how you translated *glory* and *honor* in 4:9\.

#### 4:11c

**for You created all things;**

* because you made everything,
* because you are the creator of everything.

**for:** This conjunction introduces the basis for saying that God is worthy of praise. Another way to translate this word is:

> because (GW)

**You created all things:** This clause indicates that God made all things in the universe. For example:

> you made the whole universe (NJB)

#### 4:11d

**by Your will they exist and came to be.”**

* and by your decision they were created and by your decision they continue to exist.”
* You chose to cause them to exist/live, and you choose to cause them to continue to exist/live.”

In some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. For example:

> You chose to create them and they have their existence according to that choice.

**by Your will:** This phrase indicates that God chose to create all things. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> by your decision (CEV)

> as you willed/chose

**they exist and came to be:** God created all beings and helps them to continue to exist. Other ways to translate these words are:

> they were created and continued to exist

> they were created and live

> you created them, and you cause them to remain/continue living

> you made them and sustain them

## Revelation 5:1 (id: 522801)

### Section 5:1–5: The Lamb was worthy to open the sealed scroll

In this section, John continued to describe his vision. In it he saw God holding a scroll. An angel asked who was worthy to open the scroll. The only one who was worthy was King David’s promised heir, whom John called “the Lamb” here.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> John saw a scroll sealed seven times

> The scroll that was sealed seven times

> The scroll that was sealed seven times and the Lamb who was worthy to open it

#### 5:1a

**Then I saw a scroll in the right hand of the One seated on the throne.**

* ¶ Then I saw a scroll in the right hand of the one sitting on the throne
* ¶ I saw the person/one sitting on the place/seat of ruling. He held in his right hand a rolled up paper/document.

**Then I saw:** This phrase introduces the next scene in John’s vision.

**a scroll:** The word *scroll* refers to a long piece of writing material.At that time people used parchment or papyrus rather than paper such as we use now. People made parchment from sheep or goat skins. People made papyrus paper from the stalks of the papyrus plant. After writing on it, it is rolled into a cylinder shape.

**in the right hand of the One seated on the throne:** God held the scroll in his right hand. In some languages it is more natural to add a verb here. For example:

> held/lying/resting in the right hand of him who sat on the throne

> that the One who sat on the throne held in His right hand

**the One seated on the throne:** This phrase refers to God. If you used the word “God” in 4:2b, you may not need to do so again here. But in some languages it is more natural to refer to God again. For example:

> God who sat on the throne

**throne:** See how you translated this word in 1:4 or 4:2\.

#### 5:1b

**It had writing on both sides**

* having been written on the inside and the outside
* It had writing on both sides of the paper.

**It had writing:** This phrase indicates that someone had written words on the scroll. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> that was written (NJB)

> that had writing (CEV)

**on both sides:** The Greek words are literally “inside and on the back.” People normally wrote on the side that is inside when the scroll is rolled up. But this scroll had writing *on both sides* of the paper. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> on back and front (NJB)

> on the inside and the outside (NLT)

#### 5:1c

**and was sealed with seven seals.**

* and sealed seven times.
* And it was securely closed with seven wax stamps indicating that only the right person was to open it.

**was sealed with seven seals:** Someone wrote on the scroll, then rolled it up and sealed it. To seal a scroll, a person dripped hot wax over the loose end of the writing material on the outside of the scroll. When the wax cools and hardens, it is *sealed*. This indicates that only those with the proper authority were allowed to open the scroll. This scroll was sealed seven times, each seal in a different place along the scroll.

In some languages people are not familiar with this process of sealing scrolls. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a word or phrase that refers to a process that has a similar meaning. It should indicate that the scroll is not to be opened except by the proper person. For example:

    > closed with seven drops of wax

    > it had seven fastenings

    > There were seven marks stuck to it so that it might not be opened except by the right person

* Describe the process. Use a short description to indicate that others are prevented from opening the scroll. For example:

    > the edge of the paper had wax dripped on it in seven places to show that it should be opened only by those with the authority to do so

    > its edge was glued seven times so that it could not be opened

Whatever way you translate this phrase, you should indicate that there were seven of these seals.

##### **General Comment on 5:1a–c**

In this verse, John told where the scroll was (5:1a), and then he described it (5:1b–c). In some languages it is more natural to describe it first. For example:

> Then I saw 1ba scroll with writing on both sides 1cand sealed with seven seals. 1aThe one who sat on the throne held it in his right hand.

### Section 5:1–5: The Lamb was worthy to open the sealed scroll

In this section, John continued to describe his vision. In it he saw God holding a scroll. An angel asked who was worthy to open the scroll. The only one who was worthy was King David’s promised heir, whom John called “the Lamb” here.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> John saw a scroll sealed seven times

> The scroll that was sealed seven times

> The scroll that was sealed seven times and the Lamb who was worthy to open it

#### 5:2a

**And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice,**

* And I saw a powerful angel announce loudly,
* And I saw a very strong angel, who called out in a loud voice,

**mighty angel:** The word *mighty* probably indicates physical strength. This angel is able to speak with a voice that can be heard everywhere.Swete, Lenski, Beckwith, Hughes, Smalley, and Mounce think it indicates this. But Aune and Osbourne think it indicates that this angel was a leader of angels.

**angel:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *angel* here refers to a spirit being who serves God. See how you translated this word in 1:1\.

**proclaiming:** This word refers to speaking publicly. It is usually done loudly so that everyone can hear. For example:

> announced (GNT)

#### 5:2b

**“Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?”**

* “Who is worthy to break the seals and unroll the scroll?”
* “Who deserves to take the scroll, remove the wax stamps, and open/unroll it?”

**Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?:** This is a real question. The speaker asked if anyone was great enough to open the scroll. This person must be suitable or fitting to the task or have the proper authority to open it. For example:

> Who deserves to open the scroll and break the seals on it? (GW)

**to break the seals and open the scroll:** The Greek order of these two clauses is “open the scroll and break its seals” (as in the RSV). But the seals must be broken before the scroll can be opened, so the BSB has the clause *break the seals* first.

It is implied that the worthy person takes the scroll from God before breaking the seals. In some languages it is more natural to include that implied information. For example:

> to take the scroll, break the seals, and open it

**break the seals:** This phrase refers to breaking the wax of each seal. Breaking the seals is easy to do, but only someone with the proper authority is allowed to break the seals.

Refer here to breaking or opening the kind of seal you translated in 5:1c.

**open the scroll:** This phrase refers to unrolling the scroll so it can be read.

#### 5:3a–5c

These verses explain that only Jesus was worthy to break the seals and open the scroll.

#### 5:3a

**But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth**

* But no one in heaven, no one on earth, and no one under the earth
* But no one in heaven nor on earth nor where the dead are

**no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth:** The phrase *no one in heaven* refers to spirit beings such as angels. The phrase *no one…on earth* refers to people alive on the earth. The phrase *no one…under the earth* refers to the spirits of dead people. No kind of being is excluded here. No one (except Jesus) had the authority to open this scroll. Other ways to translate these phrases are:

> no one in heaven or on earth or in the place of the dead

> no one in heaven nor anywhere on earth nor in the place where the dead are

#### 5:3b

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> John saw a scroll sealed seven times

> The scroll that was sealed seven times

> The scroll that was sealed seven times and the Lamb who was worthy to open it

#### 5:4a

**And I began to weep bitterly,**

* I began to weep very much
* I then cried greatly

**And I began to weep bitterly:** The Greek clause is literally “I was weeping greatly.” The Greek grammar indicates weeping over a period of time. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> I wept and wept (NIV)

> I then cried very much

#### 5:4b

**because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or look inside it.**

* because there was no one considered worthy to open the scroll or look inside it.
* because no one saw anyone who deserved to open the scroll and look inside.

**no one was found worthy:** The clause *no one was found* is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> no one found anyone to be worthy

> no one found one person to be worthy

> there was no one who was worthy

**was found:** Here the phrase *was found* indicates that no one considered anyone worthy to open the scroll. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> was considered

> was counted

> no one saw that someone was worthy

### Section 5:1–5: The Lamb was worthy to open the sealed scroll

In this section, John continued to describe his vision. In it he saw God holding a scroll. An angel asked who was worthy to open the scroll. The only one who was worthy was King David’s promised heir, whom John called “the Lamb” here.

#### 5:5a

**Then one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep!**

* Then/But one of the elders told me, “Do not weep!
* Except that one of the leaders said to me, “Stop crying.

**Then:** The Greek word here is usually translated “and” or “but.” However, this verse tells of the one exception to “no one” in 5:4\. In some languages this connection must be made clear. For example:

> But thenKankanaey Back Translation on TW.

> Except that

**one of the elders:** The word *elders* refers to the leaders who were worshiping God in 4:10\. See how you translated the word *elders* there.

#### 5:5b

**Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed**

* Look, the Lion of the clan of Judah, the Shoot of David, has won the victory.
* Indeed/Hey, the one called ‘the Lion of the clan of Judah,’ and ‘the Heir/Descendant of David’ has conquered all who stood against him.

**Behold:** The word emphasizes or calls attention to the words that follow. In some languages it will be more natural to translate it as:

> Listen

Other ways to translate this word are:

> Look (NJB)

> See (NIV)

**the Lion of the tribe of Judah:** This phrase is a title for the Christ. In Genesis 49:9–10, Jacob prophesied that Judah would be like a lion. Jacob also said that one day all nations would obey the person with this title. Therefore, the Jews used this title for the Christ. Jesus is that descendant of Judah. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> The Lion from Judah’s tribe (GNT)

> the one titled The Lion Who Descended From Judah

**Lion:** A lion is a large, fierce, four\-legged animal. It weighs about 200 kilograms (450 pounds) and is about 2 meters (6\.5 feet) in length. See how you translated this word in 4:7\.

**tribe:** Here the word *tribe* refers to one of the twelve groups in the nation of Israel. The groups were founded by the twelve sons of the man named Jacob, or Israel. The name “Israel” is the name for the nation of the Jews. Another way to translate this word is:

> clan

**the Root of David:** Here the word *Root* probably refers to a new shoot that grows from the root of a plant after the main plant has been cut off. This phrase combines the thoughts in Isaiah 11:1 and 11:10\. For example, the REB says:

> the shoot growing from David’s stock

It refers to the promised leader of God’s people who descended from King David. He was David’s heir. In some languages the meaning of *the Root of David* will not be clear. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Translate the meaning without the metaphor. For example:

    > the special/unique Descendant of David

    > the promised Heir of David

    > the one who renews/restores David’s kingship

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. For example:

    > This phrase combines the thoughts in Isaiah 11:1 and 11:10\. It indicates that one who could open the scroll was the promised leader of God’s people who descended from King David. *But if your word for “shoot” refers to ancestors, you should translate as in the first option above.*

**has triumphed:** This phrase refers to winning a victory over enemies. Jesus followed God’s plan to redeem mankind by dying on a cross for their sins. By that act, Jesus defeated sin and death. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> has won the victory (GNT)

> has conquered (RSV)

> has surpassed all

These verses do not say over which enemies Jesus triumphed. It is best not to add this information. But in some languages it is necessary to say over what Jesus triumphed. If that is true in your language, use a phrase that can refer generally to what he triumphed over. For example:

> has triumphed over all things

> has prevailed over all his enemies

#### 5:5c

**to open the scroll and its seven seals.”**

* He can break the scroll’s seven seals and open it.”
* He is worthy to remove its seven wax stamps and open/unroll the scroll.”

**to open the scroll and its seven seals:** The Greek clause indicates that 5:5c is the result of 5:5b. Jesus conquered his enemies, and that deed showed that he had the authority to open the scroll. For example:

> so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals. (RSV)

> thus he can open the scroll and its seven seals. (NET)

It is implied here that Jesus is worthy to open the scroll. In some languages this implied information must be explicit for the correct meaning. For example:

> He is worthy and able to open the scroll and its seven seals

> He is worthy to open the scroll and its seven seals

* **Associated Passages:** REV 5:5

## Revelation 5:6 (id: 522811)

### Section 5:6–14: Many people praised the Lamb

In this section, John described the one who was worthy to open the seals. He was like a lamb that had been killed. John also described those who worshiped the lamb. Then he wrote what they said.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> Every being/person praised the Lamb

> Worship of the Lamb that was slain

> The Lamb is praised/worshiped

#### 5:6a

**Then I saw a Lamb who appeared to have been slain,**

* ¶ Then I saw a Lamb, which appeared to have previously been killed,
* ¶ I saw a Lamb. The Lamb looked as if someone had killed it/him.

**Lamb:** This word refers to a young sheep. Here, it is used as a title for Jesus. Jewish people killed a lamb at the Passover as a sacrifice to God. The lamb has symbolic meaning as a special sacrifice and is a symbol for the Christ. Jesus was killed at Passover, and he died as a sacrifice to God. Many English versions capitalize the word *Lamb* here to indicate it is used as a title.

In some languages readers would not clearly understand a literal translation of this word as a title. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain in a footnote that it is a title for Jesus as the Christ. An example footnote is:

> This word is a symbolic title for Jesus.

In some languages it will be helpful to explain the title in a footnote. Example footnotes are:

> This word is a symbolic title for Jesus. It indicates that he was like the lambs that the Jewish people sacrificed to God at every Passover feast. Like those lambs, he died at Passover as a sacrifice to God.

> This title indicates that Jesus was like the lambs that the Jewish people sacrificed to God at every Passover feast. Like those lambs, he died at Passover as a sacrifice to God.

In some languages people are not familiar with sheep and lambs, so you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > a young tame animal called a sheep

    > the Passover sacrifice animal

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > The word “Lamb” refers to the young of an animal called a sheep. The Jews sacrificed a lamb at every Passover feast. *You may then want to include all or part of the example footnotes above which explain the title rather than two separate footnotes on the same word.*

**who appeared to have been slain:** This phrase indicates that the Lamb had in fact been killed, but it was now alive again. It probably implies that the Lamb still had the marks that showed that he had been killed. Perhaps it had wounds or scars. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> looked as if it had once been killed (CEV)

> appeared to have been killed (GNT)

**have been slain:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> they had killed it/him

#### 5:6b

**standing in the center of the throne,**

* standing near the throne
* He was standing beside the place/seat of ruling,

#### 5:6c

**encircled by the four living creatures and the elders.**

* with the four living beings and the elders around him.
* and the four living beings, and the elders surrounded them all.

#### 5:6b–c

**standing in the center of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the elders:** The Greek words are literally “standing in the middle/midst of the throne and the four living creatures, and in the middle/midst of the elders.” The words probably indicate that the Lamb was standing very near the throne. The four living creatures stood around the throne and the Lamb. The elders then surrounded the Lamb, the throne, and the four living creatures. For example:

> near the throne, and the four living creatures were there also, and the elders surrounded them all

These clauses do not mean that the Lamb was “on” the throne or “at” the throne. The Lamb comes to the throne in 5:7\.

**throne:** This word refers to the official chair of a king or leader. The word *throne* is a symbol for authority to rule. See how you translated this word in 4:4\.

**the four living creatures:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *living creatures* is literally “living (ones).” The word refers to beings that are like angels yet symbolically look like animals (4:7\). See how you translated this phrase in 4:6\.

**the elders:** Here the word *elders* refers to those who have authority. These twenty\-four people (or angels) were leaders. They had God as their leader. See how you translated this word in 4:4\.

#### 5:6d

**The Lamb had seven horns and seven eyes,**

* He/It, the Lamb, had seven horns and seven eyes,
* The Lamb had seven horns and seven eyes.

**seven horns:** Here the word *horns* refers to the horns on an animal’s head. Horns are a symbol of strength.

In some languages a literal translation would not imply the symbolic meaning of the horns. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. For example:

    > Horns are a symbol of strength.

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > seven horns symbolizing his great power

**seven:** The number *seven* is symbolic of completeness or perfection. The fact that the Lamb had seven horns indicated that its power was perfect, just like God’s power is perfect.

#### 5:6e

**which represent the seven Spirits of God sent out into all the earth.**

* which are the seven spirits of God sent by him into every part of the earth.
* The seven eyes represent/symbolize the sevenfold Spirit of God. God sent them into the whole world.

**which represent the seven Spirits of God sent out into all the earth:** This clause tells the reader more about the seven eyes of 5:6d. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other groups of seven eyes and only this one is *the seven Spirits of God*. If that is true in your language, translate these words so that they tell more about the seven eyes of 5:6d. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> These are the seven spirits of God sent by him into all the earth.

> His seven eyes mean the Seven Spirits of God that he commands to go to the whole world.Uma Back Translation on TW.

**the seven Spirits of God sent out:** The clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> the seven spirits of God that he sent

**the seven Spirits of God:** Many scholars believe that the phrase *the seven Spirits* is a symbolic reference to the Holy Spirit. Other scholars believe that the phrase refers to seven angels or to seven other spirits who serve God. See how you translated this phrase in 1:4 or 4:5\.

**into all the earth:** This phrase indicates that God sent the Holy Spirit all over the whole earth. For example:

> into every part of the earth

* He came to him who sat on the throne and took the scroll from his right hand.
* He went to the person/one sitting on the place/seat of ruling. The Lamb took from him the scroll that was in his right hand.

**He:** This pronoun refers to the Lamb. But the title “Lamb” refers to Jesus. Use the correct pronoun here.

**came and took the scroll from the right hand of the One seated on the throne:** The Lamb moved toward the throne rather than toward John. In some languages it is more natural to use the verb “went” instead of *came*.

In some languages it would be helpful to indicate where he went. For example:

> He went to the one who sat on the throne and took the scroll from his right hand

* the four living beings and the twenty\-four elders prostrated themselves in front of the Lamb.
* the four living beings and the twenty\-four leaders knelt and put their faces to the ground with arms outstretched before the Lamb.

#### 5:8a–b

**fell down:** Here the phrase *fell down* refers to kneeling and putting the face to the ground with arms outstretched toward someone. The elders and creatures did this deliberately in order to show humility before God and to honor him. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> prostrated themselves (NJB)

> threw themselves to the ground (NET)

Some languages have a different action that shows complete humility and honor to someone. If that is true in your language, you may want to use that action here. See how you translated this phrase in 3:9 or 4:10\.

#### 5:8c

**Each one had a harp,**

* Each of them had a harp
* They each had a stringed instrument

**Each one:** This phrase probably refers to both the living creatures and the elders.Osbourne, Kistemaker, Mounce, Hughes, and Johnson say it is both the living creatures and the elders, but don’t make it clear why they say so. Beale, Smalley, Aune, Swete, and Lenski say it is only the elders here. Some argue that the masculine form of “each” in the Greek requires it only refer to the elders since “creatures” in Greek in neuter. But in mixed groups including male participants (i.e., men and women) the masculine form is always used. The living creatures participate in worship in other places of this vision, so it seems best to include them here. Many English versions do not try to make it clear whether this word refers to both groups or just the elders. For example, the NJB says:

> each one of them

Some scholars think this refers only to the elders. For example, the REB says:

> Each of the elders

**harp:** A harp is a stringed instrument which is used to make music. There were several types of harps. Two examples are:

If harps are not known in your area, you may want to:

* Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > stringed musical instrument called a harp

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > A harp is a stringed musical instrument.

#### 5:8d

**and they were holding golden bowls full of incense,**

* and held a golden bowl filled with incense,
* and held a bowl made of gold full of dried tree sap. It burned and made a sweet\-smelling smoke.

**golden bowls:** Here these *bowls* were the kind used to burn incense.

They were not the kind used for eating. They were probably shaped like bowls used in eating. But you should not refer to them as “soup dishes” or anything else referring to food.

**golden:** The word *golden* indicates that the bowls were made of gold. Gold is a rare metal of a somewhat yellow color. It was the most expensive metal known at that time. It is naturally shiny and beautiful. See how you translated this word in 1:12\.

**incense:** The word *incense* refers to the dried sap of certain kinds of trees. The dried sap burns slowly to make a sweet\-smelling smoke. Incense is often used as a part of worship.

In some languages people are not familiar with *incense*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the word in your translation. For example:

    > special tree resin/sap called incense burned to give/release a sweet smell

    > sweet smelling tree resin/sap called incense

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Incense is the dried sap of certain trees. The dried sap burns slowly to make a sweet\-smelling smoke. People often burned incense as part of their worship.

#### 5:8e

**which are the prayers of the saints.**

* which are the prayers of the believers.
* This sap and smoke represented/symbolized the prayers of God’s holy people.

**which are the prayers of the saints:** This clause tells the reader more about the bowls full of incense. The clause indicates that the incense in each bowl is a symbol for *the prayers of the saints*.Beale (pages 357–358\) explains well why only the incense represents the prayers. Also see Revelation 8:3–4\.

Be sure to translate this in such a way that it is clear that John is informing his readers what these bowls represent. He is not distinguishing them from other bowls by saying in what way they differ. If it would be helpful in your language, translate these words so that they tell more about the incense. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> The incense in the bowls was the prayers of the saints.

In some languages it will be necessary to indicate explicitly that the incense is a symbol. For example:

> which are symbolically the prayers of the saints

> The incense represents the prayers of the saints

**the saints:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *saints* means “holy ones.” The word does not refer to a small group of believers who were extremely godly. Here the word refers to all believers. For example:

> God’s people (GNT)

* The four living beings and the twenty\-four leaders sang a newly created song,

**they sang a new song:** The word *new* here indicates that no one had sung this song before. It was a song for this occasion. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> they sang a newly composed song

> they sang a song that had never been sung before

**they:** This pronoun refers to the four living beings and the twenty\-four leaders (5:8\).

#### 5:9b–10b

These words are a song praising the Lamb. If possible, translate and print them in a way that shows that they are a song or poetry.

#### 5:9b

**“Worthy are You to take the scroll and open its seals,**

* “You(sing) are worthy to take the scroll and to break its seals,
* “You deserve to take the scroll and to remove/undo its devices/warnings and open/unroll it,

**Worthy:** The word *Worthy* indicates that it was right and proper for the Lamb to open the seals. He deserved this privilege. See how you translated this word in 5:2\.

Here the word *Worthy* is emphasized in the Greek. If possible, emphasize the word *Worthy* naturally in your language. For example:

> Worthy are You (BSB, NASB)

> You are indeed worthy

**open its seals:** This phrase refers to breaking the seals on the scroll so that the scroll can be unrolled. You may want to use the same verb that you used for “break the seals” in 5:2\.

#### 5:9c

**because You were slain,**

* because you were killed,
* because they/people killed you,

**You were slain:** The word *slain* means “killed” (as in the GNT). This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. In this verse, the exact people who killed Jesus is not important. For example:

> they/people killed you

#### 5:9d

**and by Your blood You purchased for God those from every tribe and tongue and people and nation.**

* and by your blood you purchased/ransomed for God people from every tribe/clan and language and people/land and nation.
* and by your sacrificial death you paid the way for people to come to God. You did that for people from every tribe, every language, every people group, and every country.

**and:** This conjunction indicates that the living creatures and the elders continue to tell why the Lamb was worthy.

**by Your blood You purchased for God those:** There is a textual issue in 5:9d: (1\) One early Greek manuscript does not have a word such as “men” as the object of the word “purchased” here. Many English versions follow that manuscript but add the word “men” or “people” for natural English (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) One early Greek manuscript and some later Greek manuscripts have the word us (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it with their best rating. This clause indicates that the Lamb died as a sacrifice. He willingly shed his blood on the cross. That was the price he paid to redeem people from the penalty of sin. By believing in him they could belong to God. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> by your blood you ransomed for God saints (NRSV)The NRSV repeats the word “saints” here from 5:8e, instead of adding a different implied word. The same group is meant as the BSB, namely, believers.

> You bought people with your blood to be God’s own (GW)

> by dying as a sacrifice, you paid for the way for people to belong to God

**by Your blood:** This phrase refers to dying as a sacrifice. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> at the cost of your own blood (NET)

> with the blood of your death (NCV)

> by shedding/spilling your life blood

**purchased:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *purchased* refers to acquiring or obtaining something by giving something in exchange for it. Other ways to translate this word are:

> bought (NJB)

> ransomed (ESV)

**those:** Here the word *those* refers to people who were “purchased.” Another way to translate this word is:

> people (GNT)

**from every tribe and tongue and people and nation:** As indicated by the BSB, the Greek word *every* only occurs before the word *tribe*. The word *tribe* applies to each of the four groups. In some languages it is more natural to repeat it for each group. For example:

> from every tribe, every language, every people, and every nation

> from all tribes, from all languages, from all places and from all kingdomsYakan Back Translation on TW.

**tribe:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *tribe* can refer to a whole people group. It can also refer to a subgroup within the people group, like the English word “clan” does.

**tongue:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *tongue* here refers to all of the people who speak a certain language. In some languages it is more natural to refer to the people directly. For example:

> people speaking every different language

**people:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *people* here refers to a large group of people. But it is sometimes used to refer to a whole country, which may have many people groups in it.

**nation:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *nation* here refers to a group of people who share a common culture. But it is sometimes used to refer to a whole country, which may have many people groups in it. It is similar in meaning to “people” above, but here it probably refers to a group of people under one government.

##### **General Comment on 5:9e**

In some languages it is more natural to list these groups in a different order. For example:

> from every language, tribe, people, and nation

> from every tribe, people, nation, and every language on earth

The four words “tribe,” “tongue,” “people,” and “nation” refer to various kinds of people groups. All four words are used to emphasize that Jesus will purchase people from all over the world for God. Some languages do not have three similar words like “tribe,” “people,” and “nation.” If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use fewer words. For example:

    > from every people and language and nation

* Use slightly different words to represent the different categories of people. For example:

    > from every clan and language and land and nation

### Section 5:6–14: Many people praised the Lamb

In this section, John described the one who was worthy to open the seals. He was like a lamb that had been killed. John also described those who worshiped the lamb. Then he wrote what they said.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> Every being/person praised the Lamb

> Worship of the Lamb that was slain

> The Lamb is praised/worshiped

#### 5:10a

**You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God,**

* And you have caused them to become our(incl) God’s kingdom and his priests,
* You have changed them into a nation belonging to our God and also changed them into those who serve him daily as a way of life.

**You have made them to be:** There is a textual issue in 5:10a: (1\) The earliest Greek manuscripts have the pronoun them (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some later Greek manuscripts have the pronoun us (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT recommends it. Here the word *made* refers to causing a change. Jesus caused the believers to change in two ways:

1. The believers were from many different people groups, but now they will be one group following one king. Therefore, they belong to one kingdom.
2. The believers will all serve as priests. Here the word “priests” refers to people whose job is to serve God.

**a kingdom and priests:** There is a textual issue in 5:10a: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the word kingdom (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) One early Greek manuscript has the word kings (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. The Greek word that the BSB translates as *and* has several meanings. There are two ways to interpret it:

1. It indicates there are two things. God made the believers to be a kingdom. He also made them to be priests. For example:

    > You have appointed them as a kingdom and priests. (NET) *(BSB, RSV, NIV, NJB, NASB, NABRE, NLT96, GW, CEV, NET, ESV, KJV)*

2. It indicates that the word “priests” describes the word “kingdom.” God made the believers into a kingdom that consists of priests. For example:

    > you have caused them to become a Kingdom of priests (NLT) *(GNT, NLT, REB, NCV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because here in the Greek the word “and” occurs between the word “kingdom” and the word “priests,” so the meaning is not the same as in 1:6\.

**kingdom:** There is a textual issue with the Greek word that the BSB translates as *kingdom*:

1. It is the word that means kingdom, a group of people under one king. Here the word refers to the believers as a group under God as their ruler. For example:

    > kingdom (RSV) *(BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NASB, NABRE, NLT, GW, NET, REB, ESV, NCV)*

2. It is the word that means kings. For example:

    > kings (CEV) *(NJB, KJV, CEV)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\).The UBS Greek NT has *basileian* “kingdom.”

**priests:** A Jewish priest was a religious leader who:

1. offered sacrifices to God for the people,
2. led the people in worship,
3. taught the people about God.

Here the word *priests* refers figuratively to people who serve God as a way of life. They worship God and help others to worship him also. But offering animals as sacrifices is not a part of the job for these people in 5:10a. See how you translated this word in 1:6\.

**to serve our God:** The Greek phrase is literally “to/for our God.” The BSB and many English versions interpret this as “to our God.” Therefore, they add the word *serve* here to make the meaning clear in English. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> for our God (GW)

> belonging to our God

#### 5:10b

**and they will reign upon the earth.”**

* and they will rule in the world.”
* They will rule on earth.”

**they will reign upon the earth:** There is a textual issue in 5:10b: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the verb form that indicates they (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the verb form that indicates we (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT recommends it. The word *reign* means “rule as kings/leaders.” The CEV translates the Greek clause as:

> they will rule on earth

**reign upon the earth:** This phrase refers to these believers ruling other people on earth, but it is not clear when this will happen. Some languages must say who is ruled over. If that is true in your language, refer in general to other people. For example:

> rule over others on the earth

## Revelation 5:11 (id: 522820)

### Section 5:6–14: Many people praised the Lamb

In this section, John described the one who was worthy to open the seals. He was like a lamb that had been killed. John also described those who worshiped the lamb. Then he wrote what they said.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> Every being/person praised the Lamb

> Worship of the Lamb that was slain

> The Lamb is praised/worshiped

#### 5:11a

**Then I looked, and I heard the voices of many angels**

* ¶ Then I looked and heard the voices of many angels,
* ¶ Then I looked around and saw many angels. I heard them shouting in unison,

**Then I looked, and I heard the voices of many angels:** These words probably indicate that John saw the angels as well as heard them, because he indicates where they are in 5:11c. In some languages it is more natural to indicate that he saw the angels. For example:

> Then I looked around and saw many angels and heard their voices

**heard the voices of many angels:** In 5:12a, John described how the *angels* spoke. They spoke loudly, and they probably spoke in unison.

In some languages it is more natural to describe how they spoke here. For example:

> heard many angels speaking loudly

#### 5:11b

**and living creatures and elders encircling the throne,**

* from around the throne, the living beings, and the elders.
* They were all around the place/seat of ruling, the living beings, and the leaders.

#### 5:11c

**and their number was myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands.**

* many ten thousands of ten thousands and many thousands of thousands,
* thousands and millions of them.

#### 5:11b–c

**myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands:** The Greek words are literally “ten thousands of ten thousands and thousands of thousands.” The two phrases refer to a very large number of angels. The phrases does not imply an exact number or that John counted them.

The two phrases together emphasize a very large number. Other ways to translate these phrases are:

> many thousands of thousands and many ten thousands of ten thousands

> thousands and millions (GNT)

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> Every being/person praised the Lamb

> Worship of the Lamb that was slain

> The Lamb is praised/worshiped

#### 5:12a

**In a loud voice they were saying:**

* They said repeatedly in a loud voice,
* They repeated/chanted loudly in unison,

**In a loud voice they were saying:** The Greek words are literally “saying with a loud voice” (as in the RSV). They probably all spoke in unison. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> They proclaimed with loud voices (REB)

> loudly chanting (NJB)

> saying in unison with loud voices

#### 5:12b–d

5:12b–d is an exclamation of praise. It is like a song or poem. You may want to translate it like a song or poem.

The angels sang about Jesus using the third person (“he, him”). But Jesus was there (5:8\). In some languages it is more natural to use second person (“you”). For example:

> The Lamb, you were slain and you are worthy to receive…

#### 5:12b

**“Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain,**

* “The Lamb, who was killed, indeed deserves
* “Worthy is the Lamb! They/People killed him but he is alive!
* The Lamb, you were killed. You are worthy

**Worthy is the Lamb:** See how you translated the word *Worthy* in 5:9\. Here the word *Worthy* is emphasized in the Greek and the BSB. If possible, emphasize the word *Worthy* naturally in your language. For example:

> The Lamb is indeed worthy

**who was slain:** This clause tells the reader more about the Lamb. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other people with the title “Lamb,” and only this one *was slain*. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about the Lamb. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> He was slain.

This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. In this verse, the exact people who killed Jesus is not important. For example:

> whom they/people killed

> They/People killed him

See how you translated the similar clause “to have been slain” in 5:6\.

#### 5:12c

**to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength**

* to be given might and riches and wisdom and power
* He is worthy to have ability and wealth and wisdom and strength
* to have power and wealth and wisdom

**to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength:** The Lamb is worthy to have *power and riches and wisdom and strength*. This phrase is similar to 4:11b where the elders said that God was worthy “to receive glory and honor and power.” Some languages are able to translate in a similar way here. For example:

> for people/everyone to praise your power and wealth and wisdom and strength

> that we acknowledge your power and wealth and wisdom and strength

> that all beings praise your power and wealth and wisdom and strength

**power…strength:** The Greek words that the BSB translates as *power* and *strength* are similar. They both refer to power, force, and strength. The Greek word that the BSB translates as *power* also can refer to ability.

Both words are probably used here to emphasize God’s power. If possible, use two different words for the meaning of “power,” “strength,” “might,” or “ability.”

In some languages, there is only one word that means both *power* and *strength*. If that is true in your language, either translate the first as “ability,” or use just the one word for a total of three things in this list. For example:

> to receive ability and wealth and wisdom and strength

> to receive power and wealth and wisdom

**wisdom:** The word *wisdom* means “be able to understand events and know what should be done.”

In some languages it is more natural to translate *wisdom* as a phrase. For example:

> wise words and actions

> right and just thinking

#### 5:12d

**and honor and glory and blessing!”**

* and honor and glory/majesty and praise!”
* and to be honored and glorified and praised!”

**and honor and glory and blessing:** These words continue the list that started in 5:12c. The words *honor* and *glory* are used in a similar way in 4:11\. See how you translated those words there.

In some languages it is more natural to start a new sentence here. For example:

> The Lamb is also worthy for everyone to honor, glorify, and praise him!

**blessing:** The Greek word the BSB translates as *blessing* can also be translated as “praise.” It refers to speaking good words about someone or honoring him. The Lamb is worthy of everyone’s blessing/praise.

In some languages it is more natural to translate this noun as a verb. See the above example.

* **Associated Passages:** REV 5:12

## Revelation 5:13 (id: 522824)

### Section 5:6–14: Many people praised the Lamb

In this section, John described the one who was worthy to open the seals. He was like a lamb that had been killed. John also described those who worshiped the lamb. Then he wrote what they said.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> Every being/person praised the Lamb

> Worship of the Lamb that was slain

> The Lamb is praised/worshiped

#### 5:13a

**And I heard every creature**

* ¶ Then I heard every being
* ¶ And I heard every living being

**every creature:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *creature* refers to all beings that God created. This includes angels, people, fish, and animals. For example:

> all the living things in creation (NJB)

#### 5:13b

**in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea,**

* living in heaven, on earth, under the earth, on the sea,
* in heaven and on earth and in the place of the dead and on the sea,

**in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea:** This phrase refers to all the different places that the creatures (5:13a) live.

**in heaven:** Here the phrase *in heaven* refers to the place where God lives.

**under the earth:** This phrase refers to the place where the spirits of dead people are. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> in the place of the dead

> where the dead are

See how you translated this phrase in 5:3\.

**sea:** Here the word *sea* refers to large bodies of water. A *sea* is often so large that someone standing on one side cannot see the other side. Some languages do not have a word or phrase for “sea.” If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > the saltwater place

    > large body of water

    > large round water

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, you may want to explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > The word “sea” refers to a large body of water. A sea is often so large that someone standing on one shore cannot see the other shore.

#### 5:13c

**and all that is in them, saying:**

* and all creatures that are in them, saying:
* and every creature in the earth and sea, saying together:

**all that is in them:** This phrase indicates that some of the creatures live in the earth and that some of the creatures live in the sea. This would include such animals as moles and fish.

#### 5:13d–e

**(reordered) “May there be praise and honor and glory and power to him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb, for ever and ever!”**

You may want to translate these words of praise as a poem or song.

#### 5:13d

**“To Him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb**

* “To him sitting on the throne and to the Lamb
* “The one who sits on the place/seat of ruling and the Lamb

**To Him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb:** The first phrase refers to God. See how you translated it at 5:1\. The second phrase refers to Jesus.

#### 5:13e

**be praise and honor and glory and power forever and ever!”**

* are praise and honor and glory and power for all time!”
* have all praise and honor and glory and authority to rule for eternity!”

**be praise and honor and glory and power:** There is no verb in the Greek. The BSB and many other English versions add the verb *be*. This phrase indicates that all the created beings agreed that God and the Lamb have *praise and honor and glory and power*. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> is praise and honor and glory and power

> praise and honor and glory and power belong to him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb

> we all praise and honor him who sits on the throne and the Lamb and they(dual) are great above all and have power over all

In some languages it is more natural to translate the four abstract nouns as verbs. See how you translated these words in 5:12 (where the BSB translates the word *praise* as “blessing”).

**power:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *power* means “power,” “rule,” and “sovereignty.” Other ways to translate this word are:

> dominion (NASB)

> ruling power (NET)

**forever and ever:** The Greek phrase is literally “into the ages of the ages.” The phrase means “always” or “eternally.” Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> for evermore

> for all ages to come

You should translate this phrase as you did in 1:6 or 1:18\.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> Every being/person praised the Lamb

> The Lamb is praised/worshiped

#### 5:14a

**And the four living creatures said, “Amen,”**

* The four living beings said, “Amen,”
* The four living beings said, “Even so,”

**And the four living creatures:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *living creatures* is literally “living (ones).” The word refers to beings that are like angels yet symbolically look like animals (4:7\). See how you translated this phrase in 4:6\.

**Amen:** The word *Amen* is a Hebrew word that means “even so” or “it is true.” The word is used to agree with what was said. The Greek borrowed the Hebrew word. English borrowed this word as well.

In some languages people are not familiar with this word. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Translate the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > It is so

    > True!

* Borrow this word and spell it as people in your language would say it. You may then want to explain its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > The word “amen” means “even so” or “it is true.”

See how you translated this word in 1:6\.

#### 5:14b

**and the elders fell down and worshiped.**

* and the elders prostrated themselves and worshiped/honored God and the Lamb.
* and the elders knelt and put their faces to the ground with arms outstretched and revered God and the Lamb.

**fell down:** Here the phrase *fell down* refers to kneeling and putting the face to the ground with arms outstretched toward someone. This position showed complete humility, and it honored the other person. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> prostrated themselves (NJB)

> threw themselves to the ground (NET)

Some languages have a different action that shows humility and honors someone. If that is true in your language, you may want to use that word or phrase. See how you translated this phrase in 4:10 or 5:8\.

**worshiped:** This word refers to honoring someone or something as sacred/divine. In some languages it is necessary to add who is worshiped. For example:

> worshiped God and the Lamb

## Revelation 6:1 (id: 522828)

### Section 6:1–17: The Lamb opened the first six seals

In this section, Jesus, the Lamb, opened six of the seven seals on the scroll. The opening of each of the first four seals revealed a rider and a horse who would cause a different kind of trouble for people on the earth. The opening of the fifth seal revealed all the people who had been killed because of their faith. The opening of the sixth seal caused the whole universe to be shaken and moved.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The Lamb opened six of the seven seals

> The Seals (NIV)

> The first six seals are opened

#### 6:1a

**Then I watched as the Lamb opened one of the seven seals,**

* ¶ Then I saw the Lamb break open one of the seven seals,
* ¶ As I watched, the Lamb removed the first of the seven wax stamps on the scroll.

**the Lamb:** This phrase refers to Jesus, just as it did in 5:13\. See how you translated it there.

**opened:** Here the word *opened* refers to breaking the wax of the seal. Other ways to translate this word are:

> break open (GNT)

> removed

See how you translated this word in 5:5 (“open”).

**one of the seven seals:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates literally as *one of* refers to whichever of the seven seals that the Lamb chose to open first.

**seals:** The *seals* were made of wax that had become hard. The seals were put on the scroll so that only someone with the proper authority could open it. See how you translated this word in 5:1\.

#### 6:1b

**and I heard one of the four living creatures**

* and I heard one of the four living beings
* Then I heard one of the four living beings

**and:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *and* introduces the result of opening the seal. Introduce this resulting event in a way that is natural in your language.

**the four living creatures:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *living creatures* is literally “living (ones).” The word refers to beings that are like angels yet symbolically look like animals (4:7\). See how you translated this phrase in 4:6 or 5:14\.

#### 6:1c

**say in a thunderous voice, “Come!”**

* say, as with a voice of thunder, “Come!” (RSV)
* say as loud as thunder, “Come!”

**say in a thunderous voice:** In Greek the phrase that the BSB translates as *a thunderous voice* is literally “a voice like thunder.” It is a simile. The word “thunder” refers to the loud noise that accompanies lightning. This phrase indicates that the voice was powerful and loud like thunder. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> say in a voice that sounded like thunder (GNT)

> say with a thunderous voice (NET)

> speaking with a noise like that of thunder

In some languages it is more natural to compare the action of speaking (rather than the voice) to thunder. For example:

> say/speak as loudly as thunder roars

> thunder/roar

**say:** The living creature spoke to the rider on the white horse (6:2\). He did not speak to John. But you should not add “to the rider on the white horse” here, because John did not see the rider and horse until after the living creature spoke.

In some languages it is more natural to translate the word *say* with a word that indicates loudness or intensity. For example:

> shout (CEV)

> call out (NRSV)

**Come!:** There is a textual issue in 6:1c: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the word come (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the words come and see (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT recommends it. This command was given to the rider in 6:2, whom John has not yet seen or who has not yet appeared. Use the appropriate word or phrase in your language.

### Section 6:1–17: The Lamb opened the first six seals

In this section, Jesus, the Lamb, opened six of the seven seals on the scroll. The opening of each of the first four seals revealed a rider and a horse who would cause a different kind of trouble for people on the earth. The opening of the fifth seal revealed all the people who had been killed because of their faith. The opening of the sixth seal caused the whole universe to be shaken and moved.

#### 6:2a

**So I looked and saw a white horse, and its rider held a bow.**

* I looked up/around, and indeed/hey, I saw a white horse with a rider who was holding/carrying a bow.
* Suddenly before my eyes there appeared a white horse and someone with a bow sitting on it.

**So I looked and saw a white horse:** The Greek words are literally “I saw, and look, a white horse.” The phrase “and look” emphasizes or calls attention to the words that follow. It also probably indicates surprise, unexpectedness, or suddenness. Other ways to translate these clauses are:

> And I looked, and behold, a white horse. (NKJV)

> I looked, and before my eyes was a white horse (JBP)

> I looked up, and suddenly/hey I saw a white horse

> Then there appeared before me a white horse!

**saw a white horse, and its rider held a bow:** The Greek words are literally “a white horse and one sitting on it having a bow.” It indicates that John saw both the *horse* and the *rider* at the same time but described the horse first. These verses also indicate that the *rider* held a bow when John saw him. Other ways to translate these Greek phrases are:

> was a white horse and rider with a bow

> was someone on a white horse and holding a bow

**horse:** A *horse* is a large, four\-legged animal that weighs 500 kilograms (1100 pounds) or more. Horses are about 1\.5 meters (5 feet) high at the back. People often use horses for transportation.

In some languages people are not familiar with horses. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the word in your translation. For example:

    > riding animal called a horse

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > A horse is a large animal that a person can ride. The person could direct the horse to go where he wanted.

**rider:** The Greek word does not say whether the *rider* was a human being, an angel, or another being. You should translate *rider* in a way that allows for any being. See the examples above.

**a bow:** A *bow* is a weapon which is used to shoot arrows. The rider may have been only carrying the bow and not shooting an arrow. But it is probably implied that he had arrows as well.

In some languages people are not familiar with bows. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain what the *bow* is in your translation. For example:

    > a war weapon called a bow

* Use a general word or phrase. For example:

    > a war weapon

* Explain it in a footnote. For example:

    > A “bow” is a war weapon.

    > A “bow” is a weapon used in war. It is a long piece of wood bent and tied with a string. A straight reed/stick with a sharpened front end is called an “arrow” and is fitted to the string and the string pulled back, creating spring tension. When the warrior releases the string, the arrow shoots forward.

* Explain it in a footnote together with an illustration. Include an illustration that shows a bow and arrow being used. You could put the illustration in your glossary, if you did not want to include one in your translation. For example:

    > A “bow” is a weapon used in war. See illustration on this page.

    > A “bow” is a weapon used in war. See illustration in glossary.

* Use a traditional war weapon common in your area. But you should not use a name of a modern weapon such as “gun.” You may then want a footnote to explain the literal word. For example:

    > Literally: “bow.” It is a long piece of wood bent and tied with a string. The warrior uses it to shoot sharp sticks called arrows at the enemy.

#### 6:2b

**And he was given a crown,**

* He was given a victory wreath,
* Someone gave this rider a crown of victory,
* He received a crown showing he would be victorious

**he was given a crown:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active or intransitive clause. For example:

> Someone/They gave a crown to him

> God gave a crown to him

> he received a crown

In some languages the words “take” and “receive” are translated by the same verb. The English verb “receive” implies that someone gave the crown, but the English verb “take” does not imply that. Your translation should imply or indicate that someone gave it.

**a crown:** Here, the Greek word that the BSB translates as *crown* probably refers to a wreath worn on the head as a sign of victory over something. Here, it symbolizes victories in war (6:2c). See how you translated this word in 2:10 or 4:4\.

#### 6:2c

**and he rode out to overcome and conquer.**

* and he went out/forth conquering and to conquer many people/nations.
* and he rode out in order to win many battles and gain the victory over many people/nations.

**he rode out to overcome and conquer:** The Greek words are literally “he went forth conquering and/even that he might conquer.” The clause emphasizes that the rider rode out to win battles, and he continuously won battles. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> he went out conquering and to conquer many

> He rode out to win many battles and gain the victory (NLT)

### Section 6:1–17: The Lamb opened the first six seals

In this section, Jesus, the Lamb, opened six of the seven seals on the scroll. The opening of each of the first four seals revealed a rider and a horse who would cause a different kind of trouble for people on the earth. The opening of the fifth seal revealed all the people who had been killed because of their faith. The opening of the sixth seal caused the whole universe to be shaken and moved.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The Lamb opened six of the seven seals

> The Seals (NIV)

> The first six seals are opened

#### 6:3a

**And when the Lamb opened the second seal,**

* ¶ When the Lamb broke open the second seal,
* ¶ The Lamb removed/undid the second wax stamp.

**the second seal:** The word *second* refers to the next seal that the Lamb chose to open. Other ways to translate this word are:

> the one after the first seal

> another seal

#### 6:3b

**I heard the second living creature say, “Come!”**

* I heard the second living being say, “Come!”
* Then the second living being said loudly, “Come!”

**say, “Come!”:** There is a textual issue in 6:3b: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the word come (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the words come and see (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT recommends it. The second living creature spoke here to the rider on the fiery red horse (6:4a). It is probably implied that he spoke loudly, like the first creature spoke (6:1c).

## Revelation 6:4 (id: 522834)

### Section 6:1–17: The Lamb opened the first six seals

In this section, Jesus, the Lamb, opened six of the seven seals on the scroll. The opening of each of the first four seals revealed a rider and a horse who would cause a different kind of trouble for people on the earth. The opening of the fifth seal revealed all the people who had been killed because of their faith. The opening of the sixth seal caused the whole universe to be shaken and moved.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

#### 6:4a

**Then another horse went forth. It was bright red,**

* Then another horse came out of something/nothing, a bright red one.
* Then another horse and rider appeared, a horse that was as red as fire.

**another horse went forth. It was bright red:** It is implied that the rider (6:4b) is on the horse. But John just described the horse at this point.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly imply that the horse *went forth* without a rider. If that is true in your language, you may want to include the implied information here. For example:

> another horse with a rider came out. This horse was a fiery red one

> another horse and rider came out. The horse was a fiery red one

**another horse went forth:** In some languages the phrase *went forth* requires saying the place that the horse went from. If that is true in your language, refer generally to something or imply coming out with a different verb. For example:

> another horse came out of something/nothing

> another horse appeared (NLT)

**It was bright red:** The second horse was bright red. It was similar in color to the bright red coals of a fire.

#### 6:4b

**and its rider was granted permission to take away peace from the earth**

* The rider was permitted to remove peace/harmony from the earth
* God authorized/empowered its rider to cause conflict/war between people on earth

**its rider was granted permission:** This clause is passive. Translate it in a similar way to the passive clause in 6:2b. For example:

> Power was given to its rider

> Someone gave power to the rider on this horse

> God gave power to the rider

> Its rider received powerIn some languages “take” and “receive” is translated by the same verb. The English verb “receive” implies that someone gave the power, but the English verb “take” does not imply that. Your translation should imply or indicate that someone gave it.

**rider:** See how you translated this word in 6:2\.

**permission to take away:** The BSB adds the word *permission*. These verses imply something like *permission* or “authority.” For example:

> the authority to take (NLT)

**take away peace from the earth:** This phrase indicates that the rider will cause people to argue and fight against each other. They will no longer be at *peace* with each other. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> remove harmony from among the people on the earth

> cause conflict between everyone on earth

**the earth:** Here the word *earth* refers to the people living on the earth. In some languages you may need to make this explicit. For example:

> people of the earth

> human beings

#### 6:4c

**and to make men slay one another.**

* and to cause people to kill each other.
* and to make people/them kill one another.

**men:** The word *men* refers to both men and women here. For example:

> people (GNT)

**slay:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *slay* here refers to killing people during a war. Other ways to translate this word are:

> kill (GNT)

> slaughter

#### 6:4d

**And he was given a great sword.**

* And he was given a large war machete.
* Someone gave a large fighting knife to him.
* He received a large sword from someone.

**And he was given a great sword:** The clause is passive. Translate this clause similarly to the passive clause in 6:4b. For example:

> a great sword was given to him (NASB)

> Someone gave a large sword to him

> He received a large swordIn some languages “take” and “receive” is translated by the same verb. The English verb “receive” implies that someone gave the power, but the English verb “take” does not imply that. Your translation should imply or indicate that someone gave it.

**sword:** A *sword* is a hand\-held weapon that cuts or stabs. The swords of that time were 60–120 centimeters (2–4 feet) long and made of metal.

In some languages people are not familiar with swords. If that is true in your language, you may want to describe it. For example:

> long knife

> cutting/sharp weapon

> war machete/bush\-knife

See how you translated this word in 1:16 or 2:12\.

#### 6:5a

**And when the Lamb opened the third seal,**

* ¶ When the Lamb broke open the third seal,
* ¶ The Lamb removed/undid the third wax stamp.

**third:** This word refers to the next item after the second one. If counted, this item would be counted as number three. Other ways to translate this word are:

> the one after the other two

> the one after the two of them

> another

#### 6:5b

**I heard the third living creature say, “Come!”**

* I heard the third living being say, “Come!”
* Then the third living being said loudly, “Come!”

**say, “Come!”:** There is a textual issue in 6:5b: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the word come (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the words Come and see (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT recommends it. The third living creature spoke here to the rider on the black horse (6:5d). It is probably implied that he spoke loudly, like the first creature spoke (6:1c).

#### 6:5c

**Then I looked and saw a black horse,**

* I looked up/around and indeed/hey, I saw a black horse
* Suddenly before my eyes there appeared a black horse

**I looked and saw:** The Greek words are literally “I saw, and look,” as in 6:2a. Translate the Greek words as you did in 6:2\.

#### 6:5d

**and its rider held in his hand a pair of scales.**

* and a rider with a balance scale in his hand.
* and someone sitting on it with a food/weight measuring device/thing in his hand.

#### 6:5c–d

**a black horse, and its rider held in his hand a pair of scales:** The Greek words are literally “a black horse and one sitting on it having a pair of scales in his hand.” It indicates that John saw both the horse and the person sitting on it at the same time but described the horse first. These words are similar in grammar to the words about the white horse and rider in 6:2a. Other ways to translate these words are:

> was a black horse and rider with a pair of scales in his hand

> was someone on a black horse, holding scales in his hand

**a pair of scales:** This phrase refers to a balance scale used for weighing things. It had two bowls which hung from a beam. The beam hung from a hook or ring halfway between the bowls. When the weight of the items in the two bowls were equal, the beam was level.

Usually a standard weight was put in one bowl. The person filled the other bowl with portions of the item for sale until the beam was level. They then had measured out the correct amount of the item to sell. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> a scale (GW)

> a balance scale (CEV)

> a device/tool for measuring the weight of food

> a weight measurer

## Revelation 6:6 (id: 522837)

### Section 6:1–17: The Lamb opened the first six seals

In this section, Jesus, the Lamb, opened six of the seven seals on the scroll. The opening of each of the first four seals revealed a rider and a horse who would cause a different kind of trouble for people on the earth. The opening of the fifth seal revealed all the people who had been killed because of their faith. The opening of the sixth seal caused the whole universe to be shaken and moved.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The Lamb opened six of the seven seals

> The Seals (NIV)

> The first six seals are opened

#### 6:6a

**And I heard what sounded like a voice from among the four living creatures, saying,**

* And I heard the sound of a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying,
* Then I heard someone speak somewhere in the midst of the four living creatures. It said,

**what sounded like a voice from among the four living creatures:** This clause probably indicates that John could not see who spoke. It was not one of the four living creatures, God, or Jesus. But the sound of the voice came from the area where the four living creatures were. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> something that sounded like a voice coming from the middle of the four living creatures (NCV)

> a voice speaking where the living beings were

#### 6:6b–d

At that time, a day’s wage for a common laborer was a silver coin called a “denarius.” A “denarius” would normally buy eight quarts of wheat or more. A “denarius” would also normally buy sixteen quarts of barley or more. Therefore, the words in 6:6b–c refer to a severe shortage of wheat and barley. They had become very expensive. But 6:6d prohibits any shortage of olive oil or wine. People used all these four foods daily to make their meals.

#### 6:6b

**“A quart of wheat for a denarius,**

* “A liter/quart of wheat will cost a day’s wages,
* “There will be a shortage so that a whole day’s pay will buy only one day’s worth of wheat kernels/grain

**A quart of wheat for a denarius:** This clause has no verb. In some languages it is necessary to add a verb for good grammar. You should probably add a future verb. For example:

> A quart of wheat will cost you a whole day’s wages! (CEV)

> One quart of wheat will be sold for a day’s pay!

> People will need a day’s wage to buy one quart of wheat!

This price is about eight times more than normal. In some languages a literal translation would not clearly indicate that the price is very high. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain the high cost in your translation. For example:

> Wheat will be so expensive that a day’s wage will purchase only one quart of it instead of eight quarts!

> One quart of wheat will cost much more than normal; it will cost a whole day’s wages!

**quart of wheat:** The grain called *wheat* was the daily food of many people at that time in that region. The Greek word for *wheat* and the kind of Greek measure probably imply wheat kernels/seeds/grain.BDAG, L\&N, Lenski, Osbourne, and Kistemaker all refer to *grain* for the Greek word for *wheat*, rather than *flour*. The wheat kernels could be eaten directly or ground into flour for bread.

A *quart of wheat* would make enough bread for one person for one day. People in some languages do not normally eat wheat bread. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use the daily food common to your area. This might be rice, corn, or some other kind of food. You may want to include a footnote to explain the literal word. An example footnote is:

    > Literally: “wheat.” Wheat bread was the daily food of many people at that time.

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Wheat was the daily food of many people at that time.

    > Wheat was the daily food in that place at that time. Bread is made from wheat. A quart/liter of wheat flour would make enough bread for one person for one day.

**quart:** The Greek word here refers to a measurement that is about equal to a *quart* or a liter. In some languages people are more familiar with liters than quarts. If that is true in your language, you may want to use the word “liter” here.

**a denarius:** At that time, one *denarius* paid the wage for one day of work by a laborer or farm worker. This was a low wage. Only poor people worked for one denarius a day.

The high prices on food indicates that people would have to work all day just to pay for enough food to eat that day. In your translation you may want to:

* Follow the NIV and use the phrase “a day’s wages” or a similar phrase. For example:

    > the money earned from a whole day of working

    > a day’s pay. *You may then want to explain the Greek word in a footnote. For example:*

    > Literally, “a denarius.” This was a Roman coin that a laborer or farm worker received for one day of work. It was a poor person’s wage.

* Use a word for a day’s wage for a poor person. For example:

    > a silver coin *You may then want to explain the Greek word in a footnote. For example:*

    > Literally, “a denarius.” This was a Roman coin that a laborer or farm worker received for one day of work.

* Spell the Greek word as someone in your language would say it and explain its meaning in a footnote. If you have used the word “denarius” in the Gospels, you may want to use it here. An example footnote is:

    > A denarius was a Roman coin that a laborer or farm worker received for one day of work.

#### 6:6c

**and three quarts of barley for a denarius,**

* and three liters/quarts of barley will cost a day’s wages,
* or three day’s worth of barley seeds/grain.

**three quarts of barley for a denarius:** The word *barley* refers to a cheaper grain than wheat. Poor people often bought *barley* instead of wheat. This price is about five times more than normal. Poor people in some languages do not normally eat barley bread. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

##### **General Comment on 6:6b–c**

* Use the daily food common to poor people in your area. It should be a food different than the word you used in 6:6b. You may then want to include a footnote to explain the literal word. For example:

    > Literally: “barley.” Barley was the daily food of poor people at that time.

* Explain *barley* in a footnote. For example:

    > “Barley” was the daily food of poor people at that time.

    > “Barley” was the daily food of poor people at that time. A low quality bread is made from barley. Three quarts/liters of barley was enough food for a small family for one day.

These two statements about food prices are probably instructions to the black horse and rider. The horse and rider will cause a shortage of foods used for the main part of the meal such as wheat and barley. The shortage will cause the high prices. People in some languages will not see that the shortage causes the high prices. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Include some implied information. For example:

    > Cause a shortage so that a quart of wheat costs a day’s wages and three quarts of barley costs a day’s wages

    > The food shortage will be so severe that a quart of wheat will cost a day’s wages and three quarts of barley will cost a day’s wages

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. For example:

    > This verse refers to a shortage of food that people eat daily. So the prices are five to eight times higher than normal. But there will not be a shortage of other food items like cooking oil and wine.

Also, the phrase “for a denarius” is repeated in 6:6c. In some languages it is more natural to omit the phrase. For example:

> 6b–cA loaf of wheat bread or three loaves of barley will cost a day’s pay. (NLT)

#### 6:6d

**and do not harm the oil and wine.”**

* and/but do not harm the olive oil and the wine!”
* But do not ruin the oil used in cooking or the wine.”

**and do not harm the oil and wine:** The person speaking prohibited the horse and rider from causing a shortage of olive oil and wine.Beale, Aune, and Swete support this interpretation of this clause. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> but do not harm oil and wine! (RSV)

> But don’t ruin the olive oil or the wine. (CEV)

**oil:** The word *oil* here refers to olive oil. The olive is the fruit of the olive tree. Olive oil is squeezed out of it. The *oil* was used as cooking oil and as fuel for lamps.

In some languages people will think that the word refers to something other than cooking oil. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain its use in your translation. For example:

> cooking oil

**wine:** Wine is made from the juice of a fruit called grapes. Grapes grow on a vine. People squeeze them and collect the juice. The juice is allowed to ferment, so *wine* is an alcoholic beverage.

At that time people commonly drank wine with the evening meal. People in some languages are not familiar with *wine*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > common beverage called wine

    > fermented grape juice

    > wine water *You may then want to explain its meaning in a footnote. For example:*

    > Wine is a beverage made from grapes. At that time people usually drank wine with the evening meal.

* Use the name of the beverage commonly used in your area with meals. You may then want a footnote to explain what wine is. For example:

    > Literally: “wine.” At that time, wine is a beverage that people commonly drank with the evening meal.

### Section 6:1–17: The Lamb opened the first six seals

In this section, Jesus, the Lamb, opened six of the seven seals on the scroll. The opening of each of the first four seals revealed a rider and a horse who would cause a different kind of trouble for people on the earth. The opening of the fifth seal revealed all the people who had been killed because of their faith. The opening of the sixth seal caused the whole universe to be shaken and moved.

* I heard the voice of the fourth living being say, “Come!”
* Then the fourth living being said loudly, “Come!”

#### 6:7a–b

**And when the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Come!”:** There is a textual issue in 6:7b: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the word come (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the words come and see (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT recommends it. These words are similar to 6:3a–b. Translate this verse in a similar way.

**I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Come!”:** The phrase *the voice of* refers to the fourth living creature speaking. In some languages it is more natural to refer to the living creature rather than his voice. For example:

> I heard the fourth living creature say, “Come!” (GNT)

**fourth:** This word refers to the next item after three other things. If counted, this item would be counted as number four. See how you translated this word in 4:7\.

**Then I looked and saw a pale green horse. Its rider’s name was Death,**

* I looked up/around, and indeed/hey I saw a pale green horse and a rider named Death.
* Suddenly before my eyes there appeared a sickly pale horse and someone upon it named Dying.

**Then I looked and saw:** The Greek words are literally “I saw, and look,” as in 6:2\. Translate these words in the same way.

**a pale green horse. Its rider’s name was Death:** The Greek words are literally “a pale horse and one sitting on it, the name for him (was) Death.” The words indicate that John saw both the horse and the rider at the same time but described the horse first. Translate these words similarly to “was a white horse! Its rider held a bow” in 6:2a. For example:

> a pale horse and a rider with the name of Death

> someone on a pale horse, and his name was Death

**pale green:** The Greek word the BSB translates as *pale green* refers to a pale yellowish or greenish gray color. Here the word probably represents the color of someone very sick and dying. Other ways to translate this color are:

> pale (NIV)

> sickly pale (REB)

> sickly green (JBP)

**Death:** Here the word *Death* is used figuratively as the name of a being. In some languages it is more natural to translate *Death* with a verb or a phrase. For example:

> Dying

> The source of death

> The one who causes people to die

#### 6:8b

**and Hades followed close behind.**

* Hades was following him/Death.
* Someone named the Place of the Dead closely followed him/Dying.

**Hades:** The word *Hades* refers to the place where the spirits of dead people live before God judges everyone.

Some ways to translate *Hades* are:

* Use the name in your language for the place of the spirits of dead people.

Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

> the place of the dead

> the land/world of the dead

* Use the Greek word and explain it in your translation. For example:

    > Hades the place of the dead

Here the word is used figuratively as the name of a being. This being named *Hades* follows a being named Death. *Hades* was not on a horse. In some languages referring to the place of the dead as a person is not natural. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the figurative use of the word in your translation. For example:

    > someone named Hades

* Translate literally and explain its use in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > The word “Hades” is used like the name of a being. The whole clause refers figuratively to many people dying and their spirits going immediately to the place of the dead.

See how you translated this word in 1:18\.

#### 6:8c

**And they were given authority over a fourth of the earth, to kill**

* They were given authority to kill a fourth of the people on the earth
* God gave them the authority to kill one of every four people on earth
* They received the ability to kill a fourth of everyone on the earth

**And they were given authority:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> And God gave to them power

> And they received power from GodIn some languages “take” and “receive” is translated by the same verb. The English verb “receive” implies that someone gave the power, but the English verb “take” does not imply that. Your translation should imply or indicate that someone gave it.

**authority:** The word *authority* refers to the authority and ability to do something. Another way to translate this word is:

> power (NIV)

**over a fourth of the earth:** This phrase refers to a quarter of the people living on earth at the time this prophecy occurs. In some languages it is more natural to refer to the people rather than the earth. For example:

> over a fourth/quarter of the people on the earth

**fourth:** Here, this word means “one out of four.” For example, in a group of four thousand people, one thousand would die. Other ways to translate this word are:

> one part in four parts

> one of four

> killing one part and leaving three parts alive

#### 6:8d

**by sword, by famine, by plague, and by the beasts of the earth.**

* by war machete, famine, disasters, and wild animals of the earth.
* by wars, widespread severe food shortages, catastrophes, and wild animals.

**by sword, by famine, by plague, and by the beasts of the earth:** These words indicate there were four ways that the pale horse and its rider caused people to die.

**sword:** A *sword* is a hand\-held weapon that cuts and stabs. Here the word *sword* represents any weapon which someone uses to kill someone else. It is probably a symbol for war here. For example:

> power…to kill people using wars (GW)

See how you translated this word in 6:4\.

**famine:** This word refers to an extreme shortage of food. During a famine, people die from hunger. Another way to translate this is:

> by starvation (NCV)

**plague:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *plague* is literally “death.” Here, the Greek word probably refers to diseases or other things that kill a lot of people in many places. Other ways to translate it are:

> pestilence (RSV)

> disease (NCV)

Some languages do not have a general word such as *plague*. If that is true in your language, you may need to use a descriptive phrase. For example:

> things that cause much death

**the beasts of the earth:** Here the word *beasts* refers to animals that attack and kill people. In some languages the word *beasts* already implies the phrase *of the earth*. If that is true in your language, you may want to omit that phrase. For example:

> wild animals (GNT)

##### **General Comment on 6:8d**

In the Greek, as in the BSB, the first three items (sword, famine, plague) are singular, but they refer generally to one or more occurrences of each one. In some languages it is more natural to translate each one as plural. For example:

> wars, famines, plagues, and the wild animals on the earth (GW)

### Section 6:1–17: The Lamb opened the first six seals

In this section, Jesus, the Lamb, opened six of the seven seals on the scroll. The opening of each of the first four seals revealed a rider and a horse who would cause a different kind of trouble for people on the earth. The opening of the fifth seal revealed all the people who had been killed because of their faith. The opening of the sixth seal caused the whole universe to be shaken and moved.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The Lamb opened six of the seven seals

> The Seals (NIV)

> The first six seals are opened

#### 6:9a

**And when the Lamb opened the fifth seal,**

* ¶ When he broke open the fifth seal,
* ¶ He removed/undid the fifth wax stamp.

**fifth:** This refers to the next item after the fourth one. If counted, this item would be counted as number five.

#### 6:9b

**I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain**

* I saw beneath the altar the spirits of those who had been killed/martyred
* So/Then I saw under the altar the spirits of believers whom unbelievers had killed previously.

**I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain:** This clause indicates that these believers were like sacrifices. These believers had followed God even when doing so meant that others would kill them. In that way, they offered their lives to God as a sacrifice.

**under the altar:** This phrase probably refers to at the base or bottom of the altar. See drawing below.

**altar:** On earth, an *altar* is a platform on which people offer sacrifices or gifts to God. The animal sacrifices are cooked or burned there. Below is one artist’s idea of the appearance of the altar where the Jews offered animal sacrifices and gifts in front of the temple in Jerusalem.

However the *altar* of this verse is in heaven in John’s vision. People do not offer animal or food sacrifices on it. But in some languages the usual translation of *altar* refers to sacrificing. For example:

> burning\-placeTagbanwa Back Translation on TW.

> bench of sacrificingBased on the Levatbura Lamasong (Notsi Madak) Back Translation, draft, Papua New Guinea.

> offering burning tableUma Back Translation on TW.

The people of many languages will understand that this usual translation of *altar*, being in heaven, will be different than altars on earth and will not be an altar on which to offer animals. But in some languages the usual translation of *altar* will imply animal sacrifice in heaven. If that is true in your language, use a more general word or phrase. For example:

> gift\-giving place

> bench of gifts to God

> offering table

**souls:** This word refers to the essential part of a person. It is the part of him that does not die when his body dies. For example:

> spirits

The same word is used in Matthew 10:28 and Acts 2:27\.

**those who had been slain:** The Greek grammar indicates that these people were killed earlier, before John saw them. The clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> those whom others have slain

**slain:** Here, the word *slain* refers to someone killing these believers. Other ways to translate this word are:

> killed (GNT)

> executed

#### 6:9c

**for the word of God and for the testimony they had upheld.**

* because of God’s message and the testimony which they possessed.
* They killed them because they were faithful to God’s word and to the message about Jesus that they had received.

**for the word of God and for the testimony they had upheld:** This part of the verse explains why these believers had been killed. Unbelievers hated and killed them because they had spoken God’s *word* and kept *the testimony*.

**for the word of God:** Here the phrase *the word of God* refers to what God said. It is the message from God to people. The believers believed this *word of God*. They probably also told it to others.

In some languages it is necessary to explain what was done with *the word of God*. For example:

> because they believed God’s message

> because they followed God’s word

**for the testimony they had upheld:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *upheld* means “kept,” “preserved,” or “possessed.” There are two ways to interpret it:

1. It means kept, preserved, or possessed here. Believers followed the testimony even though others persecuted them and killed them. They did not try to change it so that people would be happy with them. For example:

    > because they were faithful to…the message they had received (NCV) *(BSB, NIV, NASB, NCV, KJV)*

2. It means give or tell here. Believers told others about Jesus and his gospel even though people persecuted and killed them. For example:

    > for the testimony they had given (NRSV) *(GNT, NJB, NRSV, NABRE, GW, CEV, NET)The English word (“borne/bore”) that the RSV, ESV, NABRE, and REB use is ambiguous. It could mean “carry as a burden while persecuted” or “carry in front for others to see.”*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because the Greek lexicons support it and not interpretation (2\).Beale (page 390\) uses the phrase “committed themselves to.” Aune (page 403–406\) uses “bore” and later “maintained.” Lenski (page 231\) uses “had.”

**testimony:** The word *testimony* means “the words spoken about what one saw or heard.” Here it probably refers to what Jesus did while on earth and who he claimed to be: the Messiah and King of all kings. Other ways to translate this word are:

> truth revealed by Jesus

> message about Jesus

#### 6:10a

**And they cried out in a loud voice,**

* They shouted,
* They earnestly/passionately shouted,

**And they cried out in a loud voice:** Here, the phrase *cried out* refers to speaking loudly in order to cause someone to listen. The souls of the dead believers were calling out to God for his attention. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> they shouted in a loud voice (GNT)

> They shouted (NLT)

#### 6:10b–c

**How long, O Lord, holy and true, until You avenge our blood and judge those who dwell upon the earth?:** God will one day judge and punish *those who dwell upon the earth*. The souls under the altar asked how long they had to wait until he does that. The question implies that they wanted him to do it soon. Other ways to translate this question are:

> Sovereign, holy, and true Lord, how long before you avenge our deaths, judging those living on earth who shed our blood?

> Almighty Lord, holy and true! How long will it be until you judge the people on earth and punish them for killing us? (GNT)

> Master, you are holy and faithful! How long will it be before you judge and punish the people of this earth who killed us? (CEV)

#### 6:10b

**“How long, O Lord, holy and true,**

* “Perfect/Unique and true supreme ruler, how long
* “Almighty Lord, you are pure/holy and true! How much longer

**O Lord, holy and true:** This is spoken to God. It describes him as *holy and true*.

In some languages having this phrase separate from the question is more natural. See the GNT and CEV examples above.

**O Lord:** This is a direct address to God. In some languages having this phrase first is more natural. See the first example in the note above.

The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Lord* refers to someone who has complete authority over something. People under the rule of this person are required to follow his decisions. Other ways to translate the Greek word are:

> Supreme Ruler

> Great Master/Leader

> Ruler of highest authority

**holy and true:** The two words *holy* and *true* describe the Lord. Place them where it is most natural in your language. For example:

> holy and true Lord

**holy:** Here the word *holy* indicates that God is perfect and unique. He only does what is right. He is different than all the other beings. Other ways to translate this word are:

> pure/perfect spiritually/morally

> unique/separate

See how you translated this word in 3:7 or 4:8\.

**true:** This word indicates that the Sovereign Lord does not lie. It also indicates that he is always truthful. He will do whatever he said he would do.

#### 6:10c

**until You avenge our blood and judge those who dwell upon the earth?”**

* until you(sing) judge the people who inhabit the earth and take revenge for our(excl) blood that was shed?”
* will it be until you judge the people on earth and punish them for killing us?”

**avenge our blood:** The word *avenge* refers to punishing someone for a wrongdoing. The word *blood* refers figuratively to death. People killed the believers under the altar because they followed Jesus. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> take revenge on those…who shed our blood (GW)

> punish them for killing us (GNT)

> take vengeance for our death (NJB)

**judge:** This word indicates that God will decide if someone is guilty or innocent of wrongdoing. It is implied that the believers under the altar expected God to declare those who killed them to be guilty and then punish them. For example:

> pass sentence (NJB)

**those who dwell upon the earth:** This phrase refers to all people. The believers under the altar wanted God’s time of judging all people to come quickly. At that time God will judge those who killed them.

The opening of the fifth seal revealed all the people who had been killed because of their faith. The opening of the sixth seal caused the whole universe to be shaken and moved.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The first six seals are opened

#### 6:11a

**Then each of them was given a white robe**

* Then they were each given a white robe, (RSV)
* Then someone gave a white robe to each of them,
* Then each of them received a white robe,

**each of them was given a white robe:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> God gave a white robe to each of them

> someone gave white robes to them all

> they received a white robeIn some languages “take” and “receive” is translated by the same verb. The English verb “receive” implies that someone gave the robe, but the English verb “take” does not imply that. Your translation should imply or indicate that someone gave it.

**robe:** This word refers to a long, loose garment that covers the body from the shoulders to the feet. A robe also has loose sleeves covering the arms.

In some languages people are not familiar with robes. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > long flowing clothes

    > one\-piece full\-length clothes

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, you may want to explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > A robe is a long loose garment which covers the body from the shoulders down to the feet. A robe also has loose sleeves covering the arms. *But if you already have a footnote at 1:13 on “robe,” you may want to refer to it in a footnote here instead. For example:*

    > See the footnote on “robe” in 1:13\.

See how you translated this word in 1:13\.

#### 6:11b

**and told to rest a little while longer,**

* and they were told to rest a little while longer, (GNT)
* he told them to wait a little longer,
* and they were told to be patient a little longer, (NJB)

**told:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. As in 6:11a, either God or an angel told them God’s message. For example:

> God told them

> they heard this message/word from God

**rest:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *rest* can also mean “wait” (as in the NIV). Since they could do nothing at this time, they were told to wait or *rest*.

#### 6:11c

**until the full number of their fellow servants, their brothers,**

* until the total number of their fellow servants, namely their brothers and sisters in Christ,
* until the complete count of fellow believers, their fellow servants,

**the full number of:** This phrase refers to all of the believers who would be killed for their faith. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the number of (NIV)

**their fellow servants, their brothers:** This phrase refers to other believers who would be killed for their faith. They will join the group already under the altar. They will be both *fellow servants* and *brothers* to the believers already under the altar.

In some languages people will think that this phrase refers to two groups. If that is true in your language, you may want to indicate it is only one group. For example:

> their fellow servants, that is, their believing/Christian brothers,

**fellow servants:** The word *fellow* indicates that the believers under the altar and the believers yet to be killed were God’s servants.

**brothers:** The word *brothers* refers to both men and women here. For example:

> their brothers and sisters (NLT)

Here Jesus used the word *brothers* to refer figuratively to believers. In some languages people will think that the word *brothers* refers to literal brothers. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain the figurative meaning in your translation. For example:

> believers (GNT)

#### 6:11d

**were killed, just as they had been killed.**

* was completed, who were to be killed as they had been.
* was fulfilled. For God’s enemies will kill them also.

**were killed, just as they had been killed:** This clause indicates that the “fellow servants, their brothers” (6:11c) will be killed also. They will be killed because they believe in Jesus, just like the believers under the altar.

**were killed:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> whom God’s enemies will kill

> whom others will kill

The opening of the fifth seal revealed all the people who had been killed because of their faith. The opening of the sixth seal caused the whole universe to be shaken and moved.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

#### 6:12a

**And when I saw the Lamb open the sixth seal,**

* ¶ I watched as he broke open the sixth seal.
* ¶ I saw the Lamb remove/undo the sixth wax stamp.

**sixth:** This refers to the next item after five other things. If counted, this item would be counted as number six.

#### 6:12b–14b

All of these events occurred when the sixth seal was opened. Probably 6:15–17 and all of chapter 7 also occur after the sixth seal was opened.

#### 6:12b

**there was a great earthquake,**

* A great earthquake occurred,
* And/Then the earth shook greatly.

**(NRSV) and:** In Greek, 6:12b begins with the conjunction usually translated “and.” Here, the conjunction implies that opening the seal caused the earthquake and other events to occur. The BSB omits the conjunction and allows the context to imply its meaning.

**there was a great earthquake:** There is a textual issue in 6:12b: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts begin 6:12b with the word and (BSB, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, NCV). (2\) One early Greek manuscript begin 6:12b with the words and look (RSV, KJV, ESV). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. The Greek clause is literally “a great earthquake occurred.” Another way to translate this clause is:

> The earth shook greatly/terribly

**earthquake:** The word *earthquake* refers to the ground shaking.

#### 6:12c

**and the sun became black like sackcloth of goat hair,**

* the sun became black like a hair sackcloth,
* The sun became black like coarse cloth made of black goat hair.

**sackcloth of goat hair:** The Greek phrase is literally “a hair sackcloth.” Sackcloth is a rough cloth. The threads of the cloth are thick and made of hair. So the simile probably refers to the rough texture and dark color of such a cloth. Use the word or phrase for a coarse cloth of this kind. For example:

> coarse sackcloth (NJB)

#### 6:12d

**and the whole moon turned blood red,**

* the whole moon became red as blood,
* The entire moon turned the color of blood.

**the whole moon turned blood red:** The Greek clause is literally “the whole moon became as blood.” This clause probably indicates that the moon turned the deep red color of blood. For example:

> the whole moon became red like blood (NCV)

**and the stars of the sky fell to the earth**

* the stars fell from the sky to the earth
* The stars fell upon the earth,

**stars of the sky:** The phrase *of the sky* describes the location of the *stars*. It poetically contrasts with the phrase “to the earth.” But in some languages the phrase *of the sky* is not necessary or natural. For example:

> stars (GNT)

**of the sky:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *sky* also means “heaven.” Here the word refers to the place where stars are. Use the normal word in your language here.

In some languages it is more natural to refer to the sky as the place where the stars fell from. For example:

> the stars fell from the sky

#### 6:13b

**like unripe figs dropping from a tree shaken by a great wind.**

* like late figs dropping from their tree when shaken by a strong wind,
* as old figs drop when a strong wind shakes the tree.

**unripe figs dropping from a tree:** This kind of fig tree bears edible fruit. Sometimes the tree bears fruit later than the normal time for figs.

In some languages fig trees are not known. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use the name of a common tree that bears fruit that the wind could blow off the tree as the fruit becomes ripe. You may then want a footnote to explain the literal word. For example:

    > Literally: “fig tree.”

* Use the major language word. You may want to include a footnote to explain why that tree was chosen for this simile. An example footnote is:

    > The fig tree is a common tree in Israel that produces late fruit. The autumn winds can easily blow the figs off the tree.

**unripe figs:** The Greek word here refers to figs that remained *unripe* late in the fig growing season. They do not ripen. After the growing season, a strong wind can easily blow them off of the tree. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> out of season figs

> late figs (NIV)

Use a word that describes fruit that a wind could blow off of the trees.

**shaken by a great wind:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> when a great wind shakes it

**The sky receded like a scroll being rolled up,**

* the sky split apart and rolled away like a scroll,
* Also, the sky split in two and moved away like someone rolling up a scroll.

**receded like a scroll being rolled up:** The Greek words are literally “split apart, like a scroll rolling up.”BDAG (page 125\) says that the Greek word *apochōrizō* means “separate” and translates it “was split” for this verse. Louw and Nida have two senses: “separate definitely” and “move away,” but they use this verse alone to justify “move away.” This would be like an opened scroll splitting in the middle and the two ends rolling themselves up away from each other. For example:

> The sky was split apart like a scroll when it is rolled up (NASB)

> The sky was split apart like a scroll being rolled up (NET)

> the sky split\-in\-two and rolled\-up like a rolled\-up paper which is opened\-up and divided\-in\-two and rolls\-up againKankanaey Back Translation on TW.

> The sky was rolled up like a scroll (NLT)

**a scroll:** A *scroll* was a long piece of paper or parchment used for writing a long document. A person unrolled it to read it and then rolled it up to put it away. The paper or parchment was normally rolled up, so it would often roll up by itself if a person did not hold it open.

In some languages people are not familiar with scrolls. If that is true in your language, you may want to use something similar in shape to a scroll. For example:

> paper

> a mat

**being rolled up:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. Since this is a figure of speech, it is not important who rolled up the scroll.

In some languages an active clause must be used. For example:

> that someone rolls up

#### 6:14b

**and every mountain and island was moved from its place.**

* and every mountain and island was shaken/removed from its place.
* And earthquakes moved/dislodged every mountain and island from its place.

**every mountain and island was moved from its place:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *moved* can also mean “removed” or “shaken.” It is not clear if this verse corresponds to 16:20 (“fled” and “no mountain could be found”) or not.The scholars also have mixed opinions. Aune has “shaken,” Osbourne has “removed,” and Smalley has “moved.” Beale translates as “moved,” but says it is connected to “fled” in 16:20\. Other ways to translate this are:

> every mountain and island was dislodged from its place (REB)

> every mountain and island was removed from its place (NIV, ESV)

> all the mountains and islands were shaken from their places (NJB)

**every mountain and island was moved:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. God caused the earthquakes that moved the mountains and islands, or he commanded someone to move them. For example:

> earthquakes moved every mountain and island

> God caused every mountain and island to move from their place

**Then the kings of the earth, the nobles, the commanders,**

* ¶ Then the kings/rulers of nations, other rulers, military leaders,
* ¶ Then the chief leaders over nations, the governors, military leaders,

**the kings of the earth:** This phrase refers to the chief rulers of every nation on earth. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> rulers of nations

> top/supreme leaders everywhere

**nobles:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *nobles* is literally “great men” (as in the RSV). This word probably refers to important leaders, but not the chief/top rulers. Other ways to translate this word are:

> rulers (GNT)

> governors (NJB)

**the commanders:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *the commanders* refers to military leaders. Use the usual word that people call the top rank of military leaders of your country. The word should be able to refer to any nation’s military leaders.

#### 6:15b

**the rich, the mighty, and every slave and free man**

* the wealthy, the people with political power, every slave, and every free man
* rich people, influential people, every person subjected to a master, and every person who rules his own life

**the rich:** This phrase refers to people who have great wealth. For example:

> the rich people (NJB)

**the mighty:** This phrase refers to people who have great political power or influence. For example:

> the men of influence (NJB)

**slave:** A *slave* is a person who belongs to his owner, called his master. A slave has to obey his master. He is not free to leave his master. Other ways to translate this word are:

> forced laborers

> those subjected to a master

**free man:** A *free man* is a person who is not a slave. A *free* person can work in exchange for money for anyone who needs him. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> free workers

> those who rule their own lives

#### 6:15c

**hid in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains.**

* hid in caves/holes and among the rocks/boulders of the mountains.

**caves:** A *cave* is a large hole which goes deep into a hillside. Here these *caves* are big enough for people to enter them. Some languages may not have a word for *caves*. If that is true in your language, use a word referring to a good hiding place underground. For example:

> holes

**rocks:** Here, this word refers to *rocks* big enough to hide behind. For example:

> boulders

**And they said to the mountains and the rocks,**

* They said/shouted to the mountains and the rocks/boulders,

**said:** Here the people spoke to the rocks and mountains because they were desperate. Other ways to translate this word are:

> called (NIV)

> shouted (CEV)

People do not normally speak to rocks and mountains. See the General Comment on 6:16a–17b below.

#### 6:16b–17b

In 6:16b–17b the people were very afraid. Your language may have a way of speaking that indicates fear. It might be short sentences. For example:

> “Fall on us! Hide us from the one sitting on the throne! Hide us from the wrath of the Lamb! 17Indeed, the great day of their wrath has come! Who can stand?”

Consider how your language indicates great fear when speaking.

#### 6:16b

**“Fall on us and hide us from the face of the One seated on the throne,**

* “Fall on us(excl) and hide us from the presence of him who sits on the throne
* “Cover/Bury us and hide us from God, the one who sits on the place/seat of ruling

**Fall on us:** The speakers called on the mountains to cover them. They wanted to avoid standing before God. They were greatly afraid that God would judge them and punish them. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> Cover us

> Bury us

**hide us from the face of:** The phrase *the face of* often refers to being in front of someone. This phrase indicates that they do not want God to see them. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> hide us from the presence of (NASB)

> hide us away from (NJB)

> hide us from the eyes of (GNT)

**the One seated on the throne:** This phrase indicates that the person referred to as *the One* is a ruler. Here the phrase refers to God (4:2–5\).

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer to someone other than God. If that is true in your language, you may want to include some implied information. For example:

> him who sits on the throne and rules everything

> the great/greatest One who sits on the throne

See how you translated a similar phrase “someone seated on it” in 4:2\.

#### 6:16c

**and from the wrath of the Lamb.**

* and from the great anger of the Lamb!
* and from the angry Lamb!

**wrath of the Lamb:** The word *wrath* refers to great anger. In some languages it is not natural to hide from an emotion like *wrath* or anger. If that is true in your language, you may need to translate *the Lamb* as the main part of the phrase. For example:

> the wrathful/furious Lamb

> the Lamb who is very angry

**the Lamb:** This phrase refers to Jesus, just as it did in 6:1\. See how you translated it there.

* **Associated Passages:** REV 6:16

## Revelation 6:17 (id: 522860)

### Section 6:1–17: The Lamb opened the first six seals

In this section, Jesus, the Lamb, opened six of the seven seals on the scroll. The opening of each of the first four seals revealed a rider and a horse who would cause a different kind of trouble for people on the earth. The opening of the fifth seal revealed all the people who had been killed because of their faith. The opening of the sixth seal caused the whole universe to be shaken and moved.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The Lamb opened six of the seven seals

> The Seals (NIV)

> The first six seals are opened

#### 6:17a

**For the great day of Their wrath has come,**

* Because the extraordinary day of their(dual) anger has come,
* For today/this is the great and terrible day when they punish us(excl) because they are angry with/against us.

**For:** This conjunction introduces the reason for what they said in 6:16b–c. For example:

> because (GW)

**the great day of Their wrath has come:** The phrase *has come* indicates that the day on which the people spoke these words was *the great day of Their wrath*.

In some languages it is necessary or more natural to translate *has come* in a different way. For example:

> the great day of their wrath is today

> It has become the great day of their wrath

**the great day:** Here the word *great* indicates that the day is important or extraordinary. This day is a special day when God and Jesus will punish the unbelievers on the earth. To those people, this day will be extremely terrifying. So you should not use a word that implies they are happy about this day. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the terrible day (GNT)

> the extraordinary day

> the unique day

**day of Their wrath:** This phrase refers to the day when God and the Lamb will be very angry. They will express their anger by punishing people. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> day when God and the Lamb show their anger

> day when God and the Lamb are angry and punishing us(excl)

#### 6:17b

**and who is able to withstand it?”**

* and who is able to endure it?” (GW)
* Not a single person can survive!”

**who is able to withstand it?:** This is a rhetorical question. It emphasizes the fact that no one can stand. Some ways to translate this are:

* Use a rhetorical question. For example:

    > who can stand against it? (JBP)

    > who is able to survive? (NLT)

* Use a statement. For example:

    > No one can stand against it!

    > Indeed, no one will survive!

**withstand:** Here this word refers to enduring or surviving. See the above examples.

##### **General Comment on 6:16–17**

The people spoke to the mountains and rocks. In some languages a literal translation is not natural. If that is true in your language, you may need to translate 6:16 as a wish or desire. For example:

> 16aThey wanted the mountains and rocks 16bto fall on them and hide them from the face of him who sits on the throne 16cand from the wrath of the Lamb. 17aThey shouted, “The great day of their wrath has come, 17band who can stand?”

> 16aThey wished/desired that the mountains and rocks 16bwould fall on them. They wished/desired the mountains and rocks to hide them so that God on the throne could not see them 16cand the Lamb would not punish them in his anger. 17aThey exclaimed, “The great day of their wrath has come. 17bNobody will be able to endure it!”

### Section 7:1–8: Angels put God’s seal on 144,000 people

In this section, John saw angels put God’s seal on 144,000 people from Israel. This seal indicates that these people belong to God.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The 144,000 of Israel Sealed (NRSV)

> The 144,000 Are Marked for God (CEV)

#### 7:1a

**After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth,**

* ¶ Next I saw four angels, standing at the four corners of the earth, (NJB)
* ¶ After that I saw four angels. One was standing in/at the north, one in/at the east, one in/at the south, and one in/at the west of the earth.

**After this:** The word *this* refers to the event in 6:16–17\. In some languages it is more natural to use the word “that.”

**angels:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *angels* refers here to spirit beings who serve God. See how you translated this word in 1:1 or 5:2\.

**the four corners of the earth:** This idiom refers to four places that are as far away from each other as possible. 7:1b implies that these four places are the sources for the winds. In many languages, winds come from the north, south, east, and west. Here, the idiom implies that the angels control the wind over the whole world. Some languages do not have an idiom that refers to four places that are as far away from each other as possible. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use the four words north, south, east, and west. For example:

    > in/at the north, the east, the south, and the west of the earth

* Translate the meaning without the idiom. For example:

    > in/at the four places on the earth far distant from each other

#### 7:1b

**holding back its four winds**

* stopping the four winds of the earth
* They prevented any wind

#### 7:1c

**so that no wind would blow on land or sea or on any tree.**

* so that wind would not blow on the land or on the sea or on any tree.
* from blowing anywhere on the earth, including on the land, the seas, or on any tree.

#### 7:1b–c

**holding back its four winds so that no wind would blow:** The phrase *its four winds* refers to winds from the north, south, east, and west. Together they represent wind from any direction. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> stopping the four winds of the earth so that no wind would blow

> preventing all wind from blowing on the earth

**blow:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *blow* probably refers to strong winds that damage things. The angels prevented the winds from causing this damage. But the Greek word may also refer to any kind of wind, strong or gentle.

**sea:** The word *sea* refers to large bodies of water. A *sea* is often so large that someone standing on one side cannot see the other side. Here it refers to oceans in general. Some languages do not have a word or phrase for “sea.” If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > the saltwater place

    > large body of water

    > large round water

* Use the major language word.

See how you translated this word in 5:13\. The word *sea* is symbolic, so you should not name a particular *sea*.

## Revelation 7:2 (id: 522862)

### Section 7:1–8: Angels put God’s seal on 144,000 people

In this section, John saw angels put God’s seal on 144,000 people from Israel. This seal indicates that these people belong to God.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The 144,000 of Israel Sealed (NRSV)

> The 144,000 Are Marked for God (CEV)

#### 7:2a

**And I saw another angel ascending from the east,**

* Then I saw another angel rising where the sun rises,
* Then I saw another angel ascending in the east.

**from the east:** The Greek phrase is literally “from the rising of the sun” (as in the RSV). This phrase is probably a poetic way to refer to the east. A more literal translation is:

> where the sun rises (NJB)

#### 7:2b

**with the seal of the living God.**

* having the seal of the God who lives forever.
* He had/held the ring/tool that puts the symbol of the living God on things.
* This angel carried a sign/stamp used to mark people, showing that they belong to the living God.

**seal:** Here the word *seal* refers to a device that puts a mark on something. The mark usually is a unique shape. Each mark identifies the owner. At that time, each king would have a ring with a unique seal that was used to make such marks. Below is an example of a ring with a *seal*.

The word *seal* has a different meaning here than at 5:1\.

In some languages people are not familiar with this kind of *seal*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > device/tool for marking ownership

    > symbol putting/marking thing

    > signet ring

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > The word “seal” refers to a device that puts a mark on something or someone. The mark shows to whom the thing or person belongs.

**the living God:** The word *living* here refers to God as being alive. God is a living being as opposed to idols which are not alive. Some other examples for translating are:

> the alive GodThis phrase should not imply in your language that He is one of many “gods.”

> the God who lives forever

#### 7:2c

**And he called out in a loud voice**

* He said with a powerful voice
* He said very loudly

**he called out in a loud voice:** Here, the phrase *called out in a loud voice* probably implies that the angel had a powerful voice. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> he cried out with a powerful voice

> he shouted in a great voice

#### 7:2d

**to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea:**

* to the four angels who had been given the ability to damage the land and the sea,
* to the four angels to whom God had given the power to hurt the earth and the sea,

**the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea:** This phrase refers to the four angels in 7:1\. God gave them the power and authority to harm the entire earth. The Greek is literally “the four angels to whom was given to them to harm the land and sea.” The BSB adds the word *power* to make the phrase natural in English. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the four angels whose duty was to devastate land and sea (NJB)

> the four angels who had been given permission to damage the earth and the sea (NET)

> the four angels who had been allowed to harm the earth and sea (GW)

**who had been given power:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. God gave them the power. For example, the NCV says:

> to whom God had given power

##### **General Comment on 7:2a–d**

7:2d includes new information about the four angels. In some languages it is more natural to put that information before the information about the new angel. For example:

> 2dThe four angels had been given power to harm the land and the sea. 2aThen I saw another angel coming up from the east, 2bhaving the seal of the living God. 2cHe said in a loud voice to the four angels,

## Revelation 7:3 (id: 522864)

### Section 7:1–8: Angels put God’s seal on 144,000 people

In this section, John saw angels put God’s seal on 144,000 people from Israel. This seal indicates that these people belong to God.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The 144,000 of Israel Sealed (NRSV)

> The 144,000 Are Marked for God (CEV)

#### 7:3a

**“Do not harm the land or sea or trees**

* “Do not damage the land or the sea or the trees
* “Do not hurt the earth or the sea or the trees

#### 7:3b

**until we have sealed the foreheads of the servants of our God.”**

* until we(excl) put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our(incl) God.”
* until we put the symbol of our(incl) God’s ownership on the foreheads of the people who serve him.”

#### 7:3a–b

**we:** The pronoun *we* indicates that the angel had other angels helping him. It probably does not include the four angels.

**have sealed:** This phrase refers to marking the people with the seal in 7:2b. This mark showed who owned those people. The kind of seal or what the mark looked like is not described in these verses. Refer generally to using the seal here. For example:

> put a mark of ownership

> put an owner’s symbol

**servants of our God:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *servants* can also be translated as “slaves.” The difference between *servants* and slaves is not important here. Here the word *servants* indicates that believers belong to God and serve him. Some ways they serve him are: worshiping him, praying to him, obeying him, and working for him. For example:

> those who serve our God

This phrase should refer generally to believers.

* **Associated Passages:** REV 7:3

## Revelation 7:4 (id: 522868)

### Section 7:1–8: Angels put God’s seal on 144,000 people

In this section, John saw angels put God’s seal on 144,000 people from Israel. This seal indicates that these people belong to God.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The 144,000 of Israel Sealed (NRSV)

> The 144,000 Are Marked for God (CEV)

#### 7:4a

**And I heard the number of those who were sealed,**

* Then I heard the count of those who were sealed:
* And the angels did so. Then I heard the number/amount of those on whom they put the symbol.

**And I heard the number of those who were sealed:** This clause implies that the angels put the mark of the seal on the believers at this time. Your translation should imply or indicate that they did that. In some languages it is more natural to clearly indicate that they did so. For example:

> And the angels did so. And I heard the number of those who were sealed:

**who were sealed:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> whom the angels sealed

#### 7:4b

**144,000 from all the tribes of Israel:**

* 144,000 people from all the clans of Israel.
* The number/amount sealed was 144,000 people from all the clans of Israel.

**144,000:** The Greek phrase uses number words: “one hundred forty\-four thousands.” There are several ways to translate this meaning:

* Use number words. For example:

    > one hundred forty\-four thousand

    > one hundred thousand and/plus forty thousand and/plus four thousand

* Use numerals as the BSB does.

Use the number word or phrase for “thousand” from the major language. For example:

> 144 tausen

> one hundred and forty\-four tausens

The number refers to the number of men or people. John may have only seen men, or he may have seen both men and women. These verses do not say. Some languages must include a noun with the number. For example:

> 144,000 men/people

**all the tribes of Israel:** God gave to Jacob the name *Israel*. Jacob/Israel had twelve sons. Each of these sons became the head of a family group. Each group was called by the name of the son who founded that group. The people of Israel became a nation (in culture, language, and identity, not just politically). Use the word for that kind of group. For example:

> all the clans of Israel

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The 144,000 of Israel Sealed (NRSV)

> The 144,000 Are Marked for God (CEV)

#### 7:5a–8c

All the tribes named here were named after the sons of Israel, except for Manasseh. Manasseh was a grandson of Israel. John used the name Manasseh instead of Dan, who was another son of Israel. He did so without explaining why.

#### 7:5a

**From the tribe of Judah 12,000 were sealed,**

* From the clan of Judah, 12,000 people were sealed,
* The angels sealed 12,000 people from the clan of Judah.

**From the tribe of Judah:** This phrase refers to the clan that descended from Judah, one of the sons of Israel. The phrase is first in the clause to emphasize who this group of 12,000 men/people were.

**12,000 were sealed:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> they sealed 12,000

> the angels sealed 12,000

#### 7:5b–8c

**from the tribe of Reuben 12,000:** The words “were sealed” are implied in each clause but not repeated. In some languages it is more natural to repeat those words. For example:

> from the clan of Reuben, 12,000 were sealed

> the angels sealed 12,000 from the tribe of Reuben

#### 7:5b

**from the tribe of Reuben 12,000,**

* from the clan of Reuben, 12,000 people were sealed,
* The angels sealed 12,000 people from the clan of Reuben.

#### 7:5c

**from the tribe of Gad 12,000,**

## Revelation 7:9 (id: 522870)

### Section 7:9–17: A great multitude praised God and the Lamb

In this section, John saw a new part of this vision. He saw believers rejoicing, praising, and worshiping in heaven. One of the elders around the throne (4:4\) explained the vision to John.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The vision of a huge crowd of believers and its explanation

> The Great Multitude in White Robes (NIV)

> God’s People Around His Throne in Heaven (GW)

#### 7:9a

**After this I looked and saw**

* ¶ Then I looked again, and indeed/hey, I saw
* ¶ After that I looked around, and suddenly I saw

**After this:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *this* is literally “these (things).” It refers to the events of 7:1–8\. Other ways to translate this phrase here are:

> After these things I looked (NASB)

> Then as I looked

> When those things were finished, I looked around/up

**I looked and saw:** The Greek words are literally “I saw, and look.” The phrase “and look” emphasizes or calls attention to the words that follow. It also probably indicates surprise or suddenness. The word “look” is not a command to look at something. Other ways to translate these words are:

> I looked again, and before my eyes appeared (JBP)

> I looked, and suddenly/hey I saw

See how you translated these words in 6:2\.

#### 7:9b

**a multitude too large to count,**

* a huge crowd that no one could count,
* so many people that no man or woman could count them.

**a multitude too large to count:** The word *multitude* means “very big crowd.” This crowd is so large that John says it is *too large to count*. Use the word in your language for such a large crowd.

**too large to count:** This clause indicates a very large number of people. God knew how many there were, but no man or woman could count them. Other ways to translate it are:

> no person could count

> innumerable

> countless

#### 7:9c

**from every nation and tribe and people and tongue,**

* from every nation and tribe/clan and people and language,
* These people were from every country, every tribe, every people group, and every language.

**from every nation and tribe and people and tongue:** The word *every* applies to each of the four groups. In some languages it is more natural to repeat it for each group. For example:

> from every nation, every tribe, every people, and every language

This phrase naming the four groups is also in 5:9d. The order of the groups is different, but the meaning is the same. See how you translated this phrase in 5:9\.

#### 7:9d

**standing before the throne and before the Lamb.**

* standing before the one sitting on the throne and before the Lamb.
* They stood before the place/seat of ruling in heaven and in front of the Lamb.

**standing before the throne:** This phrase refers to standing before God. He is sitting on the throne. But John usually speaks indirectly about God, as in 4:2\.

In some languages it is more natural to refer to the person sitting on the throne. You should refer only indirectly to God. For example:

> standing before the one on the throne

> standing before him who sits on the throne

In some languages it is more natural to refer to God here. For example:

> standing before God sitting on the throne

**Lamb:** This word refers to a young sheep. Here, the word is a symbolic title for Jesus Christ. See how you translated this word in 5:6\.

#### 7:9e

**They were wearing white robes**

* They wore white robes

**robes:** This word refers to a long loose garment that covers the body from the shoulders to feet. A robe also has loose sleeves covering the arms. See how you translated this word in 1:13 or 6:11\.

#### 7:9f

**and holding palm branches in their hands.**

* and held palm branches in their hands.
* and held the branches of a tree named palm in their hands as a symbol of joy and victory.

**palm branches:** Palm trees have branches that all extend from the top of the trunk. The leaves are long and flat.

In some languages people are not familiar with palm trees. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a general word referring to tree branches. You may then want to describe them. For example:

    > flat branches

    > branches of the palm tree

* Use a word for a similar tree with long, flat branches.

Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, you may want to explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

> Palm trees have branches that all extend from the top of the trunk. The leaves are long and flat.

You may want to include an illustration.

To the Jewish people *palm branches* are symbolic of joy and victory (as in Leviticus 23:40 and John 12:13\). In many languages a literal translation would not imply this symbolic meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the symbolic meaning in your translation. For example:

    > palm branches as a symbol of joy and victory

* Explain the symbolic meaning in a footnote. For example:

    > Palm branches were a symbol of joy and victory.

* Use a symbol of rejoicing or victory in your language. Do not use a symbol that has incorrect connections to spirits and such things. You may then want to explain the literal word in a footnote. For example:

    > Literally: “palm branches.” In Jewish culture, palm branches were a symbol of joy and victory.

#### 7:10a

**And they cried out in a loud voice:**

* They shouted in a loud voice, (NJB)
* They were saying/chanting loudly,

**And they cried out in a loud voice:** Here this clause indicates that these people shouted loudly because they felt very strongly about what they were saying. They strongly desired to praise God and Jesus. Another way to translate this clause is:

> they shouted (CEV)

The Greek grammar probably indicates that they shouted the words of 7:10b–d repeatedly. For example:

> they were shouting with a mighty shout (NLT)

> they chanted loudly

#### 7:10b

**“Salvation to our God,**

* “Salvation comes from our God, (GNT)
* “Our(incl) God is the one who is able to save us!”

**Salvation to our God:** This clause indicates that God is the source of salvation. For example:

> Salvation comes from our God…! (GNT)

> Our God…has the power to save his people (CEV)

> The one who saved us, it is our GodKankanaey Back Translation on TW.

> Concerning our God…, he is the one who saved us.Otomi Back Translation on TW.

**Salvation:** This noun refers to the event of someone rescuing another person. God saves people. Here it may refer to saving people from hell, or the terrible things in this book or something else. If possible, do not say what people are saved from.

In some languages it is more natural to translate *Salvation* using a verb. For example:

> Our God has the power to save

> Our God has made the way to save us!

In some languages it is necessary to say whom God saves. For example:

> Our God …has the power to save his people (CEV)

> Our God is the one who saves us(incl)!

In some languages it is necessary to say what God saves people from. If that is true in your language, refer in a general manner to death or danger. For example:

> Saving people from death

#### 7:10c

**who sits on the throne,**

* who is seated as king on the throne,
* He reigns/rules from his place/seat of ruling!

**who sits on the throne:** The clause *who sits on the throne* indicates that God rules as king.

In some languages translating the purpose of the *throne* is more natural. For example:

> who rules as king over everything

This clause tells the reader more about God. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other gods and, only this one sits on the throne. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about God. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> He sits on the throne as king

**throne:** See how you translated this word at 3:21 or 4:9\.

#### 7:10d

**and to the Lamb!”**

* and salvation also comes from the Lamb!”
* And the Lamb is also the one who is able to save us!”

**and to the Lamb:** Here, this phrase indicates that salvation also belongs to the Lamb. That is, Jesus and God together are the source of salvation. In some languages it is more natural to repeat some information in 7:10b. For example:

> and salvation also belongs to the Lamb!

> and the Lamb has the power to save!

* All the angels were standing around the throne, (NIV)
* All of the angels were standing in a circle around the place/seat of ruling,

#### 7:11a–b

**And all the angels stood around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures:** The throne was at the center of the area. Near the throne were the four living creatures (4:6b). The elders were in a circle around the throne and the four living creatures (4:4a). This clause indicates that the angels surrounded all these things. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> All the angels stood around the throne, the elders, and the four living creatures. (GNT)

> all the angels who were standing in a circle round the throne, surrounding the elders and the four living creatures (NJB)

#### 7:11b

**and around the elders and the four living creatures.**

* the elders, and the four living beings.
* and surrounded the leaders and the four living beings.

**the elders:** Here the word *elders* refers to those who have authority. These twenty\-four people (or angels) were leaders. They had God as their leader. See how you translated this word in 4:4\.

**the four living creatures:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *living creatures* is literally “living (ones).” The word refers to beings that are like angels. See how you translated this phrase in 4:6\.

#### 7:11c

**And they fell facedown before the throne and worshiped God,**

* They prostrated themselves before the throne and worshiped/honored God,
* They knelt and put their faces to the ground with their arms outstretched before the place/seat of ruling and revered God.

**And they fell facedown:** Here, this phrase refers to kneeling and putting the face to the ground with arms outstretched toward someone. This position showed complete humility before God and honored him. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> prostrated themselves…and touched the ground with their foreheads (NJB)

> threw themselves down with their faces to the ground (NET)

Many languages have a different action that shows complete humility and honor to someone. If that is true in your language, you may want to use that word or phrase. See how you translated the similar phrases in 4:10 or 5:14\.

**worshiped:** This word refers to honoring someone or something as sacred/divine. Other ways to translate this word are:

> venerated

> revered

**Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and strength be to our God:** These words praise God. There is no verb in the Greek. The BSB and many other English versions add the verb *be*. This phrase indicates that the angels agreed that God had praise and glory and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and strength. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> our God has all praise and glory and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and strength

> Praise, glory, wisdom, thanks, honor, power, and strength belong to our God forever and ever! (CEV)

> We praise and glorify our God. He is wise! We thank and honor him. He is powerful and mighty!

See how you translated a similar clause in 1:6 (“to Him be the glory and power”).

#### 7:12a

**saying, “Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom**

* saying, “Amen. Praise and majesty and wisdom
* They said, “Even so. Praise, glory, wisdom,

**Amen:** The word *Amen* is a Hebrew word that means “even so” or “it is true.” It is used to agree with what was said. The Greek borrowed the Hebrew word. English borrowed this word as well. See how you translated this word in 1:6 or 5:14\.

**Blessing:** This word refers to speaking words to honor someone. In some languages it is more natural to translate this noun as a verb. For example:

> We praise you, our God

> May our God be blessed

**glory:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *glory* refers to greatness, power, splendor, and majesty. In some languages it is more natural to translate this as a verb or adjective. For example:

> we glorify our God

> Our God is glorious/great/majestic

See how you translated this word in 4:9 or 5:12\.

**wisdom:** The word *wisdom* means “be able to understand events and know what should be done.” See how you translated this word in 5:12\.

#### 7:12b

**and thanks and honor and power and strength**

* and thanks and honor and might and power
* thanksgiving, reverence, ability, and strength

**honor:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *honor* means “respect, reverence.” See how you translated it in 5:12\.

**power and strength:** The Greek words that the BSB translates as *power* and *strength* both refer to power, force, and strength. The Greek word that the BSB translates as *power* can also refer to ability. If possible, use two words related to “power,” “strength,” “might,” or “ability” here.

In some languages it is more natural to use verbs or adjectives. For example:

> Our God is strong and mighty

> How powerful is our God! How mighty is he!

See how you translated the two words *power* and *strength* in 5:12\.

#### 7:12c

**be to our God forever and ever! Amen.”**

* goes to our(excl) God forever and ever. Amen!”
* belong to you,(sing) our(excl) God always. Truly!”

**forever and ever:** The Greek phrase is literally “into the ages of the ages.” This phrase means “always” or “eternally.” See how you translated this phrase in 5:13\.

## Revelation 7:13 (id: 522878)

### Section 7:9–17: A great multitude praised God and the Lamb

In this section, John saw a new part of this vision. He saw believers rejoicing, praising, and worshiping in heaven. One of the elders around the throne (4:4\) explained the vision to John.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The vision of a huge crowd of believers and its explanation

> The Great Multitude in White Robes (NIV)

> God’s People Around His Throne in Heaven (GW)

#### 7:13a

**Then one of the elders addressed me:**

* ¶ In response, one of the elders/leaders asked me,
* ¶ Then one of the leaders responded to the words of the angels and asked me,

**one of the elders addressed me:** The Greek words are literally “one of the elders answered and said to me.” The word “answered” probably indicates that the elder responded to the praise of the angels (7:12\). He responded by speaking to John. Other ways to translate these words are:

> one of the elders responded and asked me

> one of the elders asked me (NIV)

> One of the elders turned to me and asked (REB)

#### 7:13b

**“These in white robes,” he asked, “who are they,**

* “These people in white robes, who are they,
* “Who are these people wearing white robes?

#### 7:13c

**and where have they come from?”**

* and where are they from?”
* Where did they come from?”

#### 7:13b–c

**“These in white robes,” he asked, “who are they, and where have they come from?”:** This is a leading question. It causes someone to think about what the answer might be. The elder knew the answer to this question and he also knew that John did not know the answer. He asked John this question to cause John to think about the people in white robes. Since John replied, you should translate these words as a question.

**These in white robes…who are they…?:** The words *These in white robes* are emphasized in the Greek and the BSB by being first in the clause. Some languages will not be able to emphasize those words in that way. For example:

> who are these in white robes…?

If possible emphasize the words *These in white robes* in another way. For example:

> Look at these people dressed in white robes. Who are they…?

> What about those people dressed in white robes? Who are they…?

**who are they, and where have they come from?:** These clauses are two questions. In some languages it is more natural to separate the questions. For example:

> Who are they? Where have they come from?

#### 7:14a

**“Sir,” I answered, “you know.”**

* I replied, “My lord, you yourself know.”
* I answered, “Sir, you know who they are, not I. Please tell me.”

**Sir:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *Sir* is literally “my lord.” The phrase is used to show honor to someone of higher status. The BSB and many other English versions use the more general word *Sir*. But in English “my” is not natural before *Sir*.

**you know:** This phrase indicates that John expected the elder to tell him what he knew. This rhetorical statement is a polite request that the elder tell him who they are. John probably did not know or did not want to guess. The pronoun *you* is emphasized in the Greek. You may need to include some implied information to indicate that John expected a reply. For example:

> it is you who knows, so would you please tell me?

> I do not know but you do. Please tell me.

#### 7:14b

**So he replied, “These are the ones who have come out of the great tribulation;**

* And he said, “These people are the ones who have passed through the great ordeal.
* And he replied to me, “These people are the believers who have ended/finished enduring the terrible distress.

**the ones who have come out of the great tribulation:** Here, the phrase *come out* indicates that earlier these people were in *the great tribulation*. They experienced all or part of the suffering of that time. The phrase *come out* also indicates that *the great tribulation* no longer affects them. They now stand before God and Jesus (7:9\). Other ways to translate these words are:

> They are those who have passed through the great ordeal (REB)

> people who have ended their time in the great tribulation

> believers who have finished experiencing/enduring the great tribulation

> people who have been through the great trial (NJB)

**the great tribulation:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *tribulation* means “distress,” “trouble,” or “oppression.” This phrase probably refers to the time just before Jesus returns. At that time God will send severe troubles upon the people of the earth. People will also severely persecute believers during that time. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the great ordeal (NRSV)

> the terrible suffering (GW)

> the great distress (NCV)

In some languages it is necessary to translate the noun *tribulation* using a verb. For example:

> the time when people suffer terribly

If you have translated Matthew 24:21 (“great tribulation”), see how you translated this meaning there.

#### 7:14c–d

**have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb:** These words refer figuratively to the believers becoming clean with respect to sin.Beale (page 436\) says that the metaphor means that, “the saints have been cleansed from their sin by their persevering faith in Christ’s death.” Mounce, Hughes, Swete, Lenski, Osbourne, and Beckwith also refer to cleansing here. Jesus’ blood cleans them.

In some languages a literal translation would not indicate the figurative meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > These words refer figuratively to Jesus cleaning the believers from their sin.

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb, that is, he has made them clean from sin.

* Translate the meaning without the metaphor. For example:

    > they have become clean from sin by means of the blood of the Lamb *You may also want a footnote to explain the literal words. An example footnote is:*

    > Literally: “they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.”

#### 7:14c

**they have washed their robes**

* They have washed their robes/clothes

**robes:** A *robe* is a one\-piece, long, loose garment that the people of that time wore. See how you translated this word in 7:9\.

#### 7:14d

**and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.**

* and whitened them in the blood of the Lamb.
* in the blood of the Lamb and completely whitened them, showing they were now holy before God.

**made them white in the blood of the Lamb:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *made them white* refers to removing stains from white cloth. The cloth becomes pure white again. These words refer figuratively to being made pure.Aune (page 474\) refers to this as a “purifying process.” Osbourne and Smalley also refer to *purifying* here.

**in the blood of the Lamb:** This phrase belongs with both verb phrases (“have washed their robes” and “made them white”). Place this phrase where it is natural in your language. For example:

> in the blood of the Lamb they have washed their robes and made them white

##### **General Comment on 7:14c–d**

The word “washed” and the phrase “made them white” probably refer to the same event. The robes are made white by being washed.

> The vision of a huge crowd of believers and its explanation

> The Great Multitude in White Robes (NIV)

> God’s People Around His Throne in Heaven (GW)

#### 7:15a–17c

These verses read like poetry.Osbourne speaks of its rhythm, Kistemaker likens it to a hymn, and Smalley also calls it poetic, with three parts in each verse. The UBS4 formats it as poetry. Consider whether you want to format these verses as poetry, as the BSB and some other English versions do.

#### 7:15a

**For this reason, they are before the throne of God**

* For that reason they stand/stay before the throne of God
* And so they stand in the presence of God in front of his place/seat of ruling

**they are before the throne of God:** This clause indicates that these people are in the presence of God. For example:

> they stand before God’s throne (GNT)

#### 7:15b

**and serve Him day and night in His temple;**

* and serve him at all times in his temple,
* and day and night do everything that he commands them to do in his temple.

**serve Him:** Here the word *serve* refers to doing religious duties such as priests do. Other ways to translate this word are:

> do His will

> do everything that He commands them to do

**day and night:** This phrase refers to doing something all the time. See how you translated this phrase in 4:8\.

**His temple:** The word *temple* refers to a building where God, or another deity, is believed to be present in a special way. People worship there. See how you translated this word in 3:12\.

#### 7:15c

**and the One seated on the throne will spread His tabernacle over them.**

* and he who sits on the throne will shelter them.
* And the one who sits on the place/seat of ruling will care for them.

**the One seated on the throne:** This phrase refers to God. This implied meaning may already be clear in your translation. See how you translated this phrase at 5:1\.

**will spread His tabernacle over them:** This clause indicates figuratively that God will dwell with these believers, protect them, and care for them. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> will shelter them with his presence (RSV)

> will be their shelter (JBP)

> will be present with them (NCV)

#### 7:16a

**‘Never again will they hunger,**

* They will never be hungry again,
* They will hunger no more

#### 7:16b

**and never will they thirst;**

* and they will never be thirsty again.
* and thirst no more.

#### 7:16a–b

**‘Never again will they hunger, and never will they thirst:** The Greek words are literally “They will hunger no more and thirst no more” (as in the NRSV). The phrase “no more” is repeated to emphasize that phrase. The repeated words in the Greek makes the two clauses poetic. For example:

> Those people will never be hungry again, and they will never be thirsty again (NCV)

But in some languages it is more natural not to repeat the words. For example:

> They will never hunger or thirst again (NJB)

#### 7:16c

**nor will the sun beat down upon them,**

* The sun will not hurt/strike them,
* The sun will not overcome them,

#### 7:16d

**nor any scorching heat.’**

* nor will searing/roasting heat do so.
* and burning heat will not overcome them.

#### 7:16c–d

**nor will the sun beat down upon them, nor any scorching heat:** These two clauses have a similar meaning. Together they emphasize that the believers will not suffer from the hot sun anymore. John probably implies a complete lack of suffering or trouble here, but the English versions all translate the Greek literally. Other ways to translate these words are:

> Neither the sun nor any burning heat will ever overcome them (GW)

> neither sun nor any scorching heat will burn them (GNT)

> The sun will not hurt them, and no heat will burn them (NCV)

**nor any scorching heat:** The phrase “will…beat down upon them” is implied from 7:16c. But it is not repeated here in the Greek or in the BSB. In some languages it is more natural to repeat some or all of that phrase. For example:

> nor will any scorching heat beat upon them

**scorching heat:** This phrase refers to heat that can burn. For example:

> burning heat (GW)

#### 7:17a

**For the Lamb in the center of the throne will be their shepherd.**

* For the Lamb at the throne will shepherd them
* It will be like that because the Lamb before/near the place/seat of ruling will provide for them like a shepherd,

**For:** This conjunction introduces the reason why believers will no longer suffer from hunger, thirst, or heat. For example:

> because (GNT)

**the Lamb in the center of the throne:** The Greek words are literally “the Lamb in the middle/midst of the throne.” This phrase probably has the same meaning as in 5:6b–c. There the Lamb is in the midst of the throne, the four living creatures, and the elders. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the Lamb at the throne

> The lamb in the center near the throne (GW)

See how you translated this phrase in 5:6\.

**will be their shepherd:** The Greek words are literally “will shepherd them.” The verb “shepherd” refers to watching over, protecting, and leading sheep or goats to new pasture. Here the phrase indicates that the Lamb watches over, protects, and provides for his people. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> will shepherd them (NET)

> will watch over them

#### 7:17b

**‘He will lead them to springs of living water,’**

* and will guide them to springs of the water of life.
* and he will lead them to springs of life\-giving water.

**‘He will lead them to springs of living water’:** This clause refers figuratively to providing for people’s needs. Like shepherds *lead* sheep to food and water, the Lamb *will lead* believers to the things they need. For example:

> he will guide them to springs of life\-giving water (GNT)

**springs:** Here the word *springs* refers to places where water arises out of the ground.

**living water:** The Greek phrase is literally “water of life.” This phrase indicates that the water is the source of life. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the water of life (NRSV)

> water that gives eternal life

> life\-giving water (GNT)

#### 7:17c

**and ‘God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.’”**

* And God will wipe every tear.”
* And God will remove all their grief and sorrow.”

**‘God will wipe away every tear from their eyes’:** This clause implies that believers will not suffer or be sad again. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer only to wiping tears, without giving true comfort. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Include this implied information in your translation. For example:

    > He will wipe every tear from their eyes so that they will not be sad ever again

* Translate the meaning with this implied information. For example:

    > God will remove all their grief and sorrows

    > God will comfort them so that they never cry/weep again

### Section 8:1–5: The Lamb opened the last seal, and an angel offered incense

In this section, the Lamb opened the seventh seal and heaven was quiet for half an hour. Then seven angels were each given trumpets. Another angel came to the altar with a bowl for burning incense. He was given incense and offered it on the altar. The angel then used the bowl to gather burning coals from the altar. He threw the burning coals upon the earth.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The Seventh Seal (GNT)

> The Seventh Seal and the Golden Censer (NRSV)

#### 8:1a

**When the Lamb opened the seventh seal,**

* ¶ When he broke open the seventh seal,
* ¶ The Lamb removed/undid the seventh wax stamp on/from the scroll.

**opened:** Here the word *opened* refers to breaking the last drop of wax that sealed the scroll. See how you translated this word in 6:1 or 6:12\.

**seventh:** The word *seventh* here refers to the next item after the sixth one. If counted, this item would be counted as number seven. Here it also refers to the last of the seven items. Use the word or phrase that is natural in your language. For example:

> the one after the other six

> the one after the six of them

> last

**seal:** A *seal* indicates that only those with the proper authority are allowed to open the thing with the seal on it. See how you translated this word in 5:1 or 6:12\.

#### 8:1b

**there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.**

* heaven was silent for about half an hour.
* So/Then for about half an hour everyone/everything in heaven was quiet.

**there was silence in heaven:** This clause indicates that heaven was quiet. There was no noise. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> all in heaven was silent

> heaven became quiet

**about half an hour:** The word *hour* refers to a period of time. There are twenty\-four hours in one day. The phrase *half an hour* refers to half of the time referred to by the word *hour*. Some languages do not have a word or phrase for the meaning of *half an hour*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a word or phrase that means about that length of time. For example:

    > about the same time as that from sundown to the first star

    > about the same time that it takes to walk two kilometers

* Use minutes. For example:

    > thirty minutes

* Use the major language word or phrase if it is well known.

#### 8:2a

**And I saw the seven angels who stand before God,**

* Then I saw the seven angels who were standing in front of God,
* Then I saw the seven angels standing before God.

**And:** Here the Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *And* introduces something that happened after the events in 8:1\. For example:

> Then (RSV)

**the seven angels who stand before God:** Here the word *stand* and the Greek tenseThe perfect. indicate that the role of these angels was to stand in the presence of God. For example:

> the seven angels who were standing before God

#### 8:2b

**and they were given seven trumpets.**

* and seven trumpets were given to them.
* Someone gave seven trumpets to them.

**they were given seven trumpets:** This clause indicates that each angel received a trumpet. This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> God had someone give seven trumpets to them

> someone gave a trumpet to each of them

> they received seven trumpetsIn some languages “take” and “receive” is translated by the same verb. The English verb “receive” implies that someone gave the trumpets, but the English verb “take” does not imply that. Your translation should imply or indicate that someone gave the trumpets.

**trumpets:** The word *trumpet* refers to a musical instrument that was often used to alert people to danger. It was also used to announce important messages. At that time trumpets were made from metal or from animal horns.

The particular kind of trumpet used here is not important. In some languages people use trumpets made of animal horn, shell, bamboo, or other material. If that is true in your language, you may want to use the word for that kind of trumpet here. See how you translated this word in 1:10 or 4:1\.

### Section 8:1–5: The Lamb opened the last seal, and an angel offered incense

In this section, the Lamb opened the seventh seal and heaven was quiet for half an hour. Then seven angels were each given trumpets. Another angel came to the altar with a bowl for burning incense. He was given incense and offered it on the altar. The angel then used the bowl to gather burning coals from the altar. He threw the burning coals upon the earth.

#### 8:3a

**Then another angel, who had a golden censer, came and stood at the altar.**

* ¶ Another angel, who had a golden incense bowl, came and stood at the altar.
* ¶ An angel with an incense burner made of gold came and stood at the platform for burning incense.

**golden:** The word *golden* indicates that the censer was made of gold. Gold is a rare metal of a somewhat yellow color. It was the most expensive metal known at that time. It is naturally shiny and beautiful. See how you translated this word in 1:12 or 5:8\.

**censer:** A *censer* is a dish or bowl that was used to carry burning incense or hot coals. It sometimes had chains, a handle, or short feet attached to it. A person would hold the censer by the chains, handle, or feet when there were burning incense or coals in it.

Some languages do not have a word for *censer*. If that is true in your language, you may want to use a general word for what a *censer* does. The exact shape of the censer is not important here. For example:

> incense bowl

> incense burner

**altar:** On earth, an *altar* is a platform on which people offer sacrifices or gifts to God. This *altar* is golden, like the small *altar* for burning incense in the Jewish Temple. But this *altar* is in heaven in John’s vision. Translate this word as you did in 6:9\.

#### 8:3b–c

**He was given much incense to offer, along with the prayers of all the saints:** The Greek words are literally “Much incense was given to him, so that he will give (it) with the prayers of all the saints.” Someone gave the incense to the angel. The angel offered both the incense and the prayers to God. For example:

> he was given a great quantity of incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints (NRSV)

#### 8:3b

**He was given much incense to offer,**

* A lot of incense was given to him to offer,
* Someone gave a large amount of sweet\-smelling dried tree sap to him to burn as an offering to God

**He was given much incense:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> someone gave much incense to him

> God had someone give a lot of incense to him

> he received much incenseIn some languages “take” and “receive” is translated by the same verb. The English verb “receive” implies that someone gave the incense, but the English verb “take” does not imply that. Your translation should imply or indicate that someone gave it.

**much incense:** The word *much* indicates more than the usual amount. The amount of *much incense* might be several handfuls or more.

**incense:** The word *incense* refers to the dried sap of certain kinds of trees. The dried sap burns slowly to make a sweet\-smelling smoke. Incense is often used as a part of worship.

In some languages people are not familiar with *incense*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain incense in your translation. For example:

    > special tree resin/sap called incense burned to give/release a sweet smell

    > sweet smelling tree resin/sap called incense

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Incense is the dried sap of certain trees. The dried sap burns slowly to make a sweet\-smelling smoke. People often burned incense as part of their worship.

    > See the footnote on incense at 5:8\.

See how you translated this word in 5:8\.

**to offer:** The word *to* introduces a purpose clause. The angel offered the incense by burning it.

In some languages people are not familiar with burning incense as an offering. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain the process in your translation. For example:

> to burn as an offering

> to offer by burning and giving the good smell

#### 8:3c

**along with the prayers of all the saints,**

* and he offered it, mingled with the prayers of all the believers,
* and to mix with the prayers of all God’s holy people.

**along with the prayers of all the saints:** This phrase indicates that the *prayers* would mix with the incense. For example:

> to mix with the prayers of God’s people (NLT)

**along with the prayers:** The smoke of burning incense is often a symbol of *prayers*. Here the incense smoke is mixed with what it represents. The prayers are offered with the incense.

**saints:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *saints* means “holy ones.” Here the word refers to all believers. See how you translated it in 5:8\.

#### 8:3d

**on the golden altar before the throne.**

* on the golden altar that was before the throne.
* He offered them on the fire on the altar. It was made of gold and stood in front of the place/seat of ruling.

**on the golden altar before the throne:** This phrase refers to the altar in 8:3a. John described the altar as being *golden* and *before the throne*. Your translation should indicate that this phrase refers to the altar in 8:3a. For example:

> on that altar of gold that stood before the throne

> on it. This altar was made of gold and stood before the throne

**on the golden altar:** The incense altar had a small place to hold the burning coals. The incense was placed on those coals. You may need to explain this process. For example:

> and burned the incense on the coals on the golden altar

* **Associated Passages:** REV 8:3

* And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the believers,
* The smoke from the incense and the prayers of God’s holy people

**And the smoke of the incense:** As the incense burned, it produced sweet\-smelling smoke. For example:

> The smoke coming from the incense (NET)

#### 8:4b

**rose up before God from the hand of the angel.**

* rose before God from the incense that came from the angel’s hand.
* rose together and went to God from where the angel put it on the altar.

**from the hand of the angel:** This phrase indicates that the angel used his hand to put the incense on the altar. The smoke came from the incense on the coals on the altar.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that the smoke came *from the hand of the angel*. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

> from the incense that came from the angel’s hand

> when the angel placed it there

> from the altar where the angel had poured them out (NLT)

##### **General Comment on 8:4a–b**

In some languages it is more natural to place the phrase “together with the prayers of the saints” at the end of the sentence. For example:

> 4a–band the smoke of the incense from the angel’s hand went up before God with his people’s prayers. (REB)

##### **General Comment on 8:3b–4b**

It is implied that the angel offered the incense. In some languages it is more natural to include the implied information in the translation. For example:

> 3bHe was given much incense to offer 3cwith the prayers of all God’s holy people. 3dThe angel put this offering on the golden altar before the throne. 4a–bThe smoke from the incense went up from the angel’s hand to God with the prayers of God’s people. (NCV)

> 3bHe was given a lot of incense to offer 3don the gold altar in front of the throne. He offered it 3cwith the prayers of all of God’s people. 4a–bThe smoke from the incense went up from the angel’s hand to God along with the prayers of God’s people. (GW)

## Revelation 8:5 (id: 522896)

### Section 8:1–5: The Lamb opened the last seal, and an angel offered incense

In this section, the Lamb opened the seventh seal and heaven was quiet for half an hour. Then seven angels were each given trumpets. Another angel came to the altar with a bowl for burning incense. He was given incense and offered it on the altar. The angel then used the bowl to gather burning coals from the altar. He threw the burning coals upon the earth.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The Seventh Seal (GNT)

> The Seventh Seal and the Golden Censer (NRSV)

#### 8:5a

**Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar,**

* Then the angel put/moved the incense bowl before him and filled it with fire from the altar,
* Then the angel brought the incense burner in front of him and filled it with some of the fire from the altar.

**the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar:** The angel already had the censer. The word *took* refers to holding it differently so that he could easily fill it. For example:

> the angel readied the censer and filled it with fire

In some languages it is more natural to omit the word *took*, leaving the meaning implied. For example:

> the angel filled the censer with fire

#### 8:5b

**and hurled it to the earth;**

* and threw it to the earth.
* He threw it down to the earth,

**hurled:** This English word refers to throwing something forcefully. But the Greek word is the normal word for “throw.” For example:

> threw (GNT)

**it:** This pronoun refers to the censer that the angel filled with fire.

#### 8:5c

**and there were peals of thunder, and rumblings,**

* Then there were crashes of thunder, rumbling/rolling thunder,
* and thunder boomed loudly, storm noises occurred,

**peals of thunder:** This phrase refers to the loud, booming noises of thunder.

**rumblings:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *rumblings* is literally “sounds/voices.” Here the word probably refers to the “rolling” sound of thunder and probably the wind. See how you translated this word in 4:5\.

#### 8:5d

**and flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.**

* lightning, and an earthquake.
* lightning flashed, and the earth shook.

**an earthquake:** This word refers to the ground shaking strongly.

##### **General Comment on 8:5c–d**

In some languages it is more natural to translate the events that occurred in 8:5c–d with verbs. For example:

> Thunder pealed/roared, the sky rumbled, lightning flashed, and the earth shook.

* **Associated Passages:** REV 8:5

## Revelation 8:6 (id: 522898)

### Section 8:6–9:21: Angels blew the first six trumpets

In this section, the blowing of each trumpet signaled a disaster. God would send these disasters upon the people of the earth. Some of the disasters were hail, fire, and poisoned water.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The Seven Angels and Trumpets (NCV)

> The Seven Trumpets (NRSV)

#### 8:6

**And the seven angels with the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.**

* ¶ Then the seven angels with the seven trumpets prepared to blow them.
* ¶ Then the seven angels got/made ready to blow the seven trumpets that they were holding.

**prepared to sound them:** This phrase indicates that the angels made themselves ready to blow the trumpets. They probably raised the trumpets and put the mouthpieces of the trumpets to their lips. For example:

> made ready to blow them (RSV)

* **Associated Passages:** REV 8:6

## Revelation 8:7 (id: 522899)

### Section 8:6–9:21: Angels blew the first six trumpets

In this section, the blowing of each trumpet signaled a disaster. God would send these disasters upon the people of the earth. Some of the disasters were hail, fire, and poisoned water.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The Seven Angels and Trumpets (NCV)

> The Seven Trumpets (NRSV)

#### 8:7a

**Then the first angel sounded his trumpet,**

* ¶ The first one blew his trumpet,
* ¶ When the first angel blew his trumpet,

**Then the first angel sounded his trumpet:** The Greek clause is literally “The first trumpeted.” It indicates that the first of the seven angels blew his trumpet. For example:

> The first blew his trumpet (NJB)

#### 8:7b

**and hail and fire mixed with blood**

* and hail and fire mixed with blood appeared
* I saw fire and rain turned to ice, both mixed with blood.

**and hail and fire mixed with blood:** The Greek clause is literally “hail and fire mixed with blood occurred/happened.” It refers to the hail, fire, and blood appearing. For example:

> Hail and fire mingled with blood appeared (JBP)

**hail and fire mixed with blood:** The Greek phrase indicates that both the hail and the fire were mixed with the blood. For example:

> hail and fire both mixed with blood

**hail:** The word *hail* refers to frozen rain. A piece of *hail* can be as small as a raindrop or bigger than a fist. Some languages do not have a word for *hail*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > frozen rain

    > rain turned to ice

    > balls of ice

    > cold, hard rain

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > The word “hail” refers to frozen rain. A piece of hail can be as small as a raindrop or bigger than a fist.

#### 8:7c

**were hurled down upon the earth.**

* and were thrown to the earth.
* Someone threw those things down to the earth.

**were hurled down:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. God probably ordered someone to hurl the hail and fire. For example:

> someone threw it

##### **General Comment on 8:7b–c**

Two verbs affect the hail and fire. First John sees them (the hail and fire “appeared”), then he saw them thrown to the earth. The second verb emphasizes the fact that God caused this disaster of hail and fire. In some languages the first verb may not be needed for the correct meaning. For example:

> hail and fire mixed with blood were thrown down on the earth (NLT)

#### 8:7d

**A third of the earth was burned up,**

* A third part of the earth was burned,
* One of every three lands/areas of the earth burned,

#### 8:7e

**along with a third of the trees**

* a third part of the trees was burned,
* one of every three trees burned,

#### 8:7f

**and all the green grass.**

* and all the green grass was burned.
* and all the green grass burned.

#### 8:7d–f

**A third of the earth was burned up, along with a third of the trees and all the green grass:** These three clauses are passive. Some languages must use other kinds of clauses. For example:

> The fire burned a third of the earth, it burned a third of the trees, and it burned all the green grass.

> The fire burned a third of the earth, a third of the trees, and all the green grass.

> A third of the land burned, a third of the trees burned, and all the green grass burned.

**A third of the earth…along with a third of the trees:** Here the word *third* means “one part out of three parts.” For example, in a group of three hundred areas of land, one hundred of them burned. Other ways to translate these clauses are:

> one plot in three plots of land…one tree in three

> one of every three lands/areas of all the earth…one of every three trees

> of all the parcels of land on the earth one parcel burned and two parcels did not burn…of all the trees one burned and two did not burn

**the earth:** Here the phrase *the earth* refers to the land.

### Section 8:6–9:21: Angels blew the first six trumpets

In this section, the blowing of each trumpet signaled a disaster. God would send these disasters upon the people of the earth. Some of the disasters were hail, fire, and poisoned water.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The Seven Angels and Trumpets (NCV)

> The Seven Trumpets (NRSV)

#### 8:8a

**Then the second angel sounded his trumpet,**

* ¶ The second angel blew his trumpet,
* ¶ When the second angel blew his trumpet,

**second:** The word *second* refers to the next item after the first one. If counted, this item would be counted as number two. See how you translated this word in 4:7 or 6:3\.

#### 8:8b

**and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea.**

* and something that looked like a big mountain, burning with fire, was thrown into the sea. (NCV)
* someone threw something like a big, fiery mountain into the sea/ocean.

**something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. God ordered someone to do this. For example:

> someone threw something like a great mountain, all ablaze

> God had someone throw something like a great mountain, all on fire

**something like a great mountain burning with fire:** This phrase indicates that the object looked like a mountain and that it was on fire. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> something that looked like a big mountain, burning with fire (NCV)

> Something that looked like a huge mountain on fire (GNT)

> something like a great fiery mountain (CEV)

**sea:** The word *sea* refers to a large body of water. A *sea* is often so large that someone standing on one side cannot see the other side. Here it probably refers to oceans in general. The *sea* is symbolic, so you should not name a particular *sea*. See how you translated this word in 5:13 or 7:1\.

#### 8:8c–9b

All three events in 8:8c–9b were caused by the thing like a big, fiery mountain. The second event (8:9a) does not have an “and” before it. This is good English style, but your language style will likely be different. List these three events naturally in your language.

#### 8:8c

**A third of the sea turned to blood,**

* A third part of the oceans turned into blood,
* One part of every three parts of the oceans became blood,

**A third of the sea turned to blood:** Here the word *third* means “one part out of three parts.” Other ways to translate this clause are:

> One part in three parts of the oceans turned into blood

> One\-third of the water in the sea became blood (NLT)

> One part of every three parts of the oceans turned into blood and the other two parts did not

#### 8:9a

**a third of the living creatures in the sea died,**

* a third part of all the living animals/things in the oceans died,
* and one of every three living creatures in the oceans died,

**a third of the living creatures in the sea died:** The phrase *living creatures* refers to fish and any other animals that live in the seas. One out of every three creatures died because the water had turned to blood. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> one third of the creatures that were living in the sea died (GW)

> one of every three beings/creatures that lived in the ocean died

#### 8:9b

**and a third of the ships were destroyed.**

* and a third part of the ships were destroyed.
* and one of every three ships sank.

**a third of the ships were destroyed:** This clause indicates that one out of every three ships were destroyed. They were either sunk or so badly ruined that they were unable to sail. This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> this event/disaster destroyed a third of the ships

### Section 8:6–9:21: Angels blew the first six trumpets

In this section, the blowing of each trumpet signaled a disaster. God would send these disasters upon the people of the earth. Some of the disasters were hail, fire, and poisoned water.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The Seven Trumpets (NRSV)

#### 8:10a

**Then the third angel sounded his trumpet,**

* ¶ The third angel blew his trumpet,
* ¶ When the third angel blew his trumpet,

**third:** This refers to the next item after the second one. If counted, this item would be counted as number three. See how you translated this word in 4:7 or 6:5\.

#### 8:10b

**and a great star burning like a torch fell from heaven**

* and a big star, fiery like a torch, plummeted from the sky
* an enormous star dropped from the sky, flaming like a torch.

**a great star burning like a torch fell from heaven:** The phrase *burning like a torch* describes the *great star*. But the main event is that it *fell from heaven*.

In some languages it is more natural to have the words *burning like a torch* after the word *fell*. For example:

> a great star fell from heaven. It was burning like a torch… (CEV)

**burning like a torch:** The word *torch* here refers to a branch of wood with one end covered with something that burns easily. This end is set on fire. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> burning like a torch (NCV)

> flaming like a torch (GW)

See how you translated the word *torch* and the illustration at 4:5\.

**fell:** This word indicates that the star descended very quickly. Other ways to translate this word are:

> dropped (GNT)

> plummeted

> crashed

**heaven:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *heaven* can refer to either the sky or *heaven*. Some languages are like Greek, having only one word that means both “heaven” and “sky.” Other languages are like English, having two words. If your language has two words, translate the Greek word as “sky” here.

#### 8:10c

**and landed on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water.**

* on a third of all the rivers and springs of water.
* It landed/fell on one of every three rivers and on one of every three springs.

**on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water:** Here the word *third* means “one out of three.” These phrases probably indicate that the star affected one out of every three rivers and one out of every three springs. Other ways to translate these phrases are:

> on one in every three rivers and springs of water

> on one of every three rivers and on one of every three springs of water

> It fell on one part of the rivers and springs and on two parts it did not fall

**springs of water:** Here the word *springs* refers to places where water arises out of the ground. In some languages it is not necessary to include the phrase *of water*. For example:

> springs (GW)

#### 8:11a

**The name of the star is Wormwood.**

* The name of the star is Absinthe/Bitter.

**Wormwood:** *Wormwood* is a plant with a very bitter taste. The plant is also named “absinthe” or “artemisia.” The name *Wormwood* does not refer to wood that has been eaten by worms.

The name focuses on the very bitter taste of this plant. The star was called *Wormwood* because it turned the waters very bitter. You may want to:

* Use the name of a very bitter plant or food in your area.
* Name the star for its bitter taste. For example:

    > “Bitterness” (GNT)

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > The name “Wormwood” refers to a plant that is very bitter.

#### 8:11b

**A third of the waters turned bitter like wormwood oil,**

* A third part of the waters became bitter,
* That one of every three rivers became bitter.

**A third of the waters:** This phrase refers to the same *third* as the “third of the rivers and…springs” in 8:10c. For example:

> That third of the rivers

> The rivers and springs that the star fell on

**bitter:** The taste of bitterness is unpleasant. Unsweetened chocolate, raw coffee beans, and some unripe fruit are *bitter*. Some medicines, such as quinine, are also very *bitter*.

#### 8:11c

**and many people died from the bitter waters.**

* and many people died from drinking the water that was bitter. (NCV)
* Many people drank this bitter water, and they died.

**many people died from the bitter waters:** The people died because they drank the bitter water. It was harmful or poisonous.

In some languages it is more natural to explain in the translation that the people drank the bitter water. For example:

> many people died from drinking the water that was bitter. (NCV)

> many people died from drinking the water, because it had turned bitter. (GNT)

> many people drank this bitter water, and they died.

#### 8:12a

**Then the fourth angel sounded his trumpet,**

* ¶ The fourth angel blew his trumpet,
* ¶ When the fourth angel blew his trumpet,

**fourth:** The word *fourth* refers to the next item after three other things. If counted, this item would be counted as number four. See how you translated this word in 4:7 or 6:7\.

#### 8:12b

**and a third of the sun and moon and stars were struck.**

* and a third of the sun was hit/affected, a third of the moon also, and a third of the stars also,
* someone hit/affected a third part of the sun, a third part of the moon, and a third part of the stars.

**a third of the sun and moon and stars were struck:** The word *struck* figuratively refers to God causing that part to become dark. This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. God probably ordered someone to strike the sun and moon and stars. For example:

> a third of the sun became dark, a third of the moon was struck, a third of the stars were struck

> someone struck/affected the sun, someone struck/affected a third of the moon, someone struck/affected one out of every three stars

> God had someone strike/affect a third of the sun, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars.

**a third of:** Here the word *third* refers to one part out of three parts. See how you translated this phrase in 8:7\.

#### 8:12c

**A third of the stars were darkened,**

* so that a third of them all became dark.
* And so a third of each of them no longer gave light.

**A third of the stars were darkened:** Probably a third of the stars stopped shining. For the sun and moon, there are two ways to interpret this clause:

1. It indicates that one part of three parts of the sun and one part of three parts of the moon became dark.
2. It indicates that the sun and moon both gave one\-third less light.

Translate possible in a way that allows either or both meanings. For example:

> the light went out of a third of them (NJB)

> their light lost a third of its brightness (GNT)

##### **General Comment on 8:12b–c**

The clause in 8:12c “A third of the stars were darkened” refers to what happened to the sun, moon, and stars. Some ways to indicate that are:

* Translate this clause as a new sentence that refers back to the whole previous sentence. For example:

    > a third of the sun, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars were struck. So a third of them became dark, (NCV)

* Add a word such as “each” or “all.” For example:

    > a third of them all became dark

    > one\-third of each turned dark

#### 8:12d

**a third of the day was without light, and a third of the night as well.**

* A third part of the day was without light, and also a third of the night.
* One of three parts of both the day and night were dark.

**a third of the day was without light:** This clause probably indicates that the sun did not shine for four out of twelve daylight hours. You should translate this clause without describing details, since the details were not told. For example:

> A third part of the day was without light

> One of three parts of the day was dark

> One part of the day was dark and two parts were not dark

**a third of the night as well:** The phrase “was without light” is implied here but not repeated. In some languages it is more natural to repeat the phrase. For example:

> a third of the night was without light

> a third of the night was dark

> the night was dark a third of the time

> In the nighttime four hours didn’t have even any stars show.Otomi Back Translation on TW.

> at night for four hours the moon and the stars did not give light.Yakan Back Translation on TW.

#### 8:13a

**And as I observed, I heard an eagle flying overhead, calling in a loud voice,**

* ¶ I saw a lone eagle flying overhead, and I heard it say in a loud voice,
* ¶ I saw an eagle that was flying high, and I heard it call in a powerful voice,

**an eagle:** There is a textual issue in 8:13a: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the word eagle (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the word angel (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. The Greek phrase is literally “one eagle.” The word “one” probably emphasizes that the eagle was alone. For example:

> a single eagle (NLT)

**eagle:** An *eagle* is a large, sometimes aggressive bird. Eagles weigh about 5 kilograms (11 pounds) and are about 1 meter (3 feet) in length.

See how you translated this word in 4:7\.

**flying overhead:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *flying overhead* refers to the open sky far above the ground. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> in midair (NIV)

> high in the air (GNT)

**calling in a loud voice:** Here the phrase *calling in a loud voice* refers to speaking loudly. Another way to translate it is:

> said with a powerful voice

#### 8:13b

**“Woe! Woe! Woe to those who dwell on the earth,**

* “How terrible, terrible, terrible for the inhabitants of the earth,
* “There will be great, terrible, and awful trouble for those living on the earth,

**Woe! Woe! Woe to those who dwell on the earth:** Here the Greek word that the BSB translates as *Woe* refers to a time of much hardship or distress. Speaking the word three times probably corresponds to three hardships (each called a “woe”).The first hardship is described in 9:1–11\. The second hardship is described in 9:13–21\. The third hardship is probably the bowl judgments in chapter 16 (Beckwith, page 669; EBC, page 688; Johnson, page 508\). The character and severity of the events of chapter 16 fits best when compared to the first two hardships. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> How terrible, terrible, terrible for the inhabitants of the earth!

> Trouble, trouble, trouble to everyone who lives on earth! (CEV)

If you have translated Matthew 11:21 (“How dreadful”), Mark 13:17 (“How miserable”), or Luke 22:22 (“woe”), see how you translated *Woe* there.

The word *Woe* is said three times to correspond to the three hardships. But in some languages repeating a word has a different use or is unnatural. If that is true in your language, repeat the meaning in a natural way. For example:

> Woe for the inhabitants of the earth! Indeed, woe to them. Yes, woe.

**those who dwell on the earth:** This phrase refers to the people living on the earth. For example:

> all who live on earth (GNT)

#### 8:13c

**because of the trumpet blasts about to be sounded by the remaining three angels!”**

* because of the blasts of the trumpets that the other three angels are about to blow!”
* for the other/last three angels are about to blow their trumpets!”

**the trumpet blasts about to be sounded by the remaining three angels:** The Greek words are literally “the remaining trumpet blasts of the angels about to sound them.” The Greek uses an active clause, and the BSB uses a passive clause. Some languages must use an active clause. For example, the RSV says:

> the blasts of the other trumpets which the three angels are about to blow

**the trumpet blasts:** The Greek phrase is literally “the remaining sounds of the trumpet.” Here this phrase refers to the sounds that the last three trumpets will make when the three angels blow them. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the remaining trumpet blasts (GW)

> the sound of the other trumpets (REB)

**about to be sounded:** This phrase indicates that the time is close for the last three angels to blow their trumpets.

* ¶ The fifth angel blew his trumpet,
* ¶ When the fifth angel blew his trumpet,

**Then the fifth angel sounded his trumpet:** Translate this clause in a similar way to the other angels sounding their trumpets. See 8:7 or 8:12\.

**fifth:** The word *fifth* refers to the next item after four other things. If counted, this item would be counted as number five. Other ways to translate this word are:

> the one after the other four

> the one after the four of them

> another (after the other four)

#### 9:1b

**and I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to earth,**

* and I saw a star which had fallen from the sky to the earth.
* I saw a being/angel that looked like a star that had previously fallen from the sky to the earth.

**a star that had fallen:** This phrase indicates that the star had already fallen. For example:

> a star that had previously fallen

**(NIV:) sky:** The Greek word that the NIV translates as *sky* can refer either to the sky or to heaven. Here John has only said that the star had fallen to the earth. So he probably meant *sky* here.

#### 9:1c

**and it was given the key to the pit of the Abyss.**

* The star was given the key to the shaft/tunnel of the bottomless pit.
* Someone gave to the being/angel the key to open the shaft/cave that went down to the very/immeasurably deep hole that is the home of demons and the dead.

**and it was given the key:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> Someone/They gave the key to him

> God had someone give the key to him

> The star received the keyIn some languages “take” and “receive” is translated by the same verb. The English verb “receive” implies that someone gave the key, but the English verb “take” does not imply that. Your translation should imply or indicate that someone gave it.

**it:** The pronoun *it* refers to the “star” mentioned in 9:1b. Another way to translate this pronoun is:

> The star (NIV)

**to:** The key opened or unlocked the shaft of the Abyss. In some languages it is more natural to include that implied information in your translation. For example:

> to open

> that unlocks

**the pit of the Abyss:** There are several ways to interpret the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *the pit of the Abyss*:

1. It means the shaft that leads to the Abyss. The Abyss is deeper in the earth, and this is the shaft that connects to it. For example:

    > the shaft leading down to the Abyss (NJB) *(RSV, NIV, NJB, NABRE, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, REB, NCV, ESV)*

2. It means the pit is the Abyss. The Abyss is a pit that has no bottom. For example:

    > the bottomless pit (NASB) *(BSB, GNT, NASB, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because the word *Abyss* means more than a hole in the ground.Beale (page 493\), Aune (pages 525–526\), Swete (page 115\), Lenski (pages 287–288\), and others support interpretation (1\).

**(NIV:) shaft:** This word refers to a very deep hole that goes straight down or goes in a mostly downward direction. Other ways to translate this word are:

> downward tunnel/cave

> hole

**Abyss:** The word *Abyss* refers to a very deep pit or chasm. It indicates that the pit or chasm was too deep to measure. Here it probably refers to something underground rather than a chasm, since a shaft leads to it. Here the Greek word that the BSB translates as *Abyss* refers to an underground place where the spirits of dead people and demons lived. Other ways to translate this word are:

> bottomless pit (RSV)

> hole deep beyond measure

> cave/cavern leading to the place of the dead

### Section 8:6–9:21: Angels blew the first six trumpets

In this section, the blowing of each trumpet signaled a disaster. God would send these disasters upon the people of the earth. Some of the disasters were hail, fire, and poisoned water.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The Seven Angels and Trumpets (NCV)

> The Seven Trumpets (NRSV)

#### 9:2a

**The star opened the pit of the Abyss,**

* He opened the shaft/tunnel of the bottomless pit,
* After/As he opened the door leading down into that hole,

**opened the pit of the Abyss:** The Greek clause is literally “he opened the shaft of the Abyss.” The NIV shortens the clause, as is natural in English. In some languages it is more natural to translate the whole Greek clause. For example:

> he opened the shaft of the Abyss

#### 9:2b

**and smoke rose out of it like the smoke of a great furnace,**

* and smoke rose from it like the smoke from an enormous furnace.
* thick, black smoke came out of it just like black smoke coming from a huge fire.

**smoke rose out of it like the smoke of a great furnace:** This clause compares the smoke coming from the Abyss to smoke that comes from a *great furnace*.

In some languages it is not natural to repeat the word *smoke*. For example:

> smoke poured out as though from a huge furnace (NLT)

**like the smoke of a great furnace:** A *furnace* is an enclosure heated by a big fire. A furnace often has a smokestack above that takes the smoke far above it. This simile refers to lots of thick black smoke rising quickly.

In some languages people are not familiar with furnaces. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a simile for something in your area that produces a lot of black smoke that rises quickly. For example:

    > like the smoke from a house fire

* Describe the meaning of the simile. For example:

    > much thick, black, smoke rising quickly

#### 9:2c

**and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke from the pit.**

* The sun and air/atmosphere became dark from the smoke of the bottomless pit.
* The smoke from that hole darkened the sun and air/atmosphere.

**and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke from the pit:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> The smoke from the Abyss darkened the sun and sky

> the sun and the air turned dark because of the smoke (CEV)

**the air:** The BSB translates the Greek phrase here literally as *the air*. The smoke probably went everywhere in the air: low to the ground and high in the sky and in between, as well. Other ways to translate this word are:

> sky (NIV)

> atmosphere

**darkened:** The word *darkened* here indicates that the smoke greatly reduced the amount of light. Here the word probably does not indicate that the sun and sky were completely dark.

* **Associated Passages:** REV 9:2

## Revelation 9:3 (id: 522917)

### Section 8:6–9:21: Angels blew the first six trumpets

In this section, the blowing of each trumpet signaled a disaster. God would send these disasters upon the people of the earth. Some of the disasters were hail, fire, and poisoned water.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The Seven Angels and Trumpets (NCV)

#### 9:3a

**And out of the smoke, locusts descended on the earth,**

* And out of the smoke, locusts descended upon the earth
* Grasshoppers came down to the earth out of the smoke.

**out of the smoke, locusts descended:** The phrase *out of the smoke* is emphasized in the Greek and the BSB. If possible, emphasize this phrase naturally in your language.

In some languages it is more natural to put this clause in its usual place. For example:

> locusts came out of the smoke

**locusts:** The Greek word used here refers to any kind of grasshopper. The *locust* is a kind of grasshopper that flies in swarms and eats all plants. Many English versions use the word *locusts* because of its harmful nature. Farmers fear swarms of locusts because they can eat a whole crop in minutes. Your language may have a word for *locusts*, or you may have a general word for grasshopper.

Some languages do not have a word for locust or grasshopper. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > swarms of plant eating, flying insects

    > swarms of flying insects called grasshoppers

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > The name “locust” refers to a plant eating, flying insect. They swarm and eat all plants and even the bark of trees. Farmers fear swarms of locusts because they can eat a whole crop in minutes.

#### 9:3b

**and they were given power like that of the scorpions of the earth.**

* and were given the power that earthly/real scorpions have.
* God gave to them power to hurt people like that of a scorpion’s sting.

**they were given power:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> God gave power to them

> they received powerIn some languages “take” and “receive” is translated by the same verb. The English verb “receive” implies that someone gave the power, but the English verb “take” does not imply that. Your translation should imply or indicate that someone gave it.

**power like that of the scorpions of the earth:** This phrase indicates that the locusts had stingers as scorpions do (9:10a). Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> like the power of earthly scorpions (GW)

> the same power that scorpions have (CEV)

**like that of the scorpions of the earth:** Scorpions can be two centimeters (0\.8 inches) long or as large as twelve centimeters (five inches), depending on the kind of scorpion. A scorpion’s tail has a stinger on the end. The stinger can stab the skin and inject poison that causes pain.

The stings of some kinds of scorpions cause only mild pain. But the stings of other kinds of scorpions cause severe pain. 9:6a implies that these locusts cause severe pain.

In some languages scorpions are not known. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Describe a *scorpion* in your translation. For example:

    > like that of an insect/animal with a sting that causes severe pain

* Use an insect or small animal in your area that has a painful sting or bite. You may then want to explain the literal word in a footnote, using the major language word for *scorpion*. An example footnote is:

    > Literally: “scorpion.” A scorpion is an insect that has a tail with a stinger on the end. It can stab the skin and inject a small amount of poison that causes pain.

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > A scorpion is an insect that has a tail with a stinger on the end. It can stab the skin and inject poison that causes severe pain.

**the scorpions of the earth:** The phrase *of the earth* indicates that these scorpions are the usual ones that live on earth. Since *the earth* is the only place where real scorpions live, some English versions omit this phrase. For example:

> scorpions (NLT)

* **Associated Passages:** REV 9:3

## Revelation 9:4 (id: 522919)

### Section 8:6–9:21: Angels blew the first six trumpets

In this section, the blowing of each trumpet signaled a disaster. God would send these disasters upon the people of the earth. Some of the disasters were hail, fire, and poisoned water.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The Seven Angels and Trumpets (NCV)

> The Seven Trumpets (NRSV)

#### 9:4a

**They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree,**

* They were told not to hurt the grass or any plant or any tree on the earth,
* God forbade them to harm any grass, green plant, or tree on the earth.

**They were told:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> God told them

**the grass of the earth or any plant or tree:** Grass, plants, and trees all grow on *the earth*. In some languages it is more natural to indicate that all these things grow on *the earth*. For example:

> any grass, green plant, or tree on the earth (GW)

Since people usually think of grass, plants, and trees as growing on the earth, it is more natural in some languages to omit the phrase *of the earth*. For example:

> the grass or plants or trees (NLT)

#### 9:4b

**but only those who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.**

* but only to hurt those people who did not have God’s seal/mark on their foreheads.
* He told them to harm only those people without the symbol of God’s ownership on their foreheads.

**but only those who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads:** This clause indicates that God told the locusts to harm the people named here. In some languages it is more natural to repeat some of the words from 9:4a here. For example:

> they could harm only the people who did not have the mark of God’s seal on their foreheads (GNT)

**those who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads:** Earlier, in 7:3–4, angels put God’s seal or mark on 144,000 people. The phrase here refers to the people without that seal or mark.

**seal:** This word refers to a mark put on the people. The mark is placed with the device called a “seal” (7:2b). What the mark looked like is not described. Other ways to translate this word are:

> mark of ownership

> owner’s symbol

See how you translated this word in 7:3\.

##### **General Comment on 9:4a–b**

In some languages it is more natural to translate these instructions as a direct quote. For example:

> They were told, “Do not harm the grass on the earth or any plant or tree. You may harm only those people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.”

* **Associated Passages:** REV 9:4

### Section 8:6–9:21: Angels blew the first six trumpets

In this section, the blowing of each trumpet signaled a disaster. God would send these disasters upon the people of the earth. Some of the disasters were hail, fire, and poisoned water.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The Seven Angels and Trumpets (NCV)

> The Seven Trumpets (NRSV)

#### 9:5a–b

**The locusts were not given power to kill them, but only to torment them for five months:** The *power* here is the same power mentioned in 9:3b. This sentence further describes that power.

#### 9:5a

**The locusts were not given power to kill them,**

* These locusts were not given the power to kill anyone, (NCV)
* God/He did not allow them to kill those people

**The locusts were not given power to kill them:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> God did not give to them the power to kill those people

> the locusts did not receive the power to kill those peopleIn some languages “take” and “receive” is translated by the same verb. The English verb “receive” implies that someone gave the power, but the English verb “take” does not imply that. Your translation should imply or indicate that someone gave it.

#### 9:5b

**but only to torment them for five months,**

* but they were given power to cause pain/suffering to the people for five months.
* but only gave to them power to make those people suffer for five months.

**torment:** This word refers to causing someone to feel severe pain. Other ways to translate this word are:

> cause pain (NCV)

> torture (NIV)

> make them suffer (CEV)

##### **General Comment on 9:5a–b**

In some languages it is more natural to first describe the power these creatures did have. For example:

> They were given power to torture them for five months, but not to kill them.

#### 9:5c

**and their torment was like the stinging of a scorpion.**

* And their pain was severe, like the pain from the sting of a scorpion when it strikes someone.
* The people suffered severe pain like that of a scorpion sting/bite.

**torment:** Translate this word the same way as in 9:5b.

> The Seven Angels and Trumpets (NCV)

#### 9:6a–d

**In those days men will seek death and will not find it; they will long to die, but death will escape them:** The words *men will seek death and will not find it* (9:6a–b) have the same meaning as the words *they will long to die, but death will escape them* (9:6c–d). Repeating the same meaning using different words emphasizes that meaning. If possible, emphasize the meaning naturally in your language.

In some languages repeating one’s words has a different use. If that is true in your language, emphasize the meaning in a natural way. For example:

> During those days men will intently seek to die, but will not find a single way to die

#### 9:6a

**In those days men will seek death**

* During those days people will look for a way to die, (NCV)
* And in those days people will try/want to die

**men:** Here the word *men* refers to both men and women.

**seek death:** The people will suffer so much severe pain from the locusts that they will want to die. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> want to die (CEV)

> look for a way to die (NCV)

#### 9:6b

**and will not find it;**

* but they will not find it. (NCV)
* but will not be able to die.

**and will not find it:** This clause indicates that the people will not die even though they want to. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> but they will not be able to (CEV)

> but find none

#### 9:6c

**they will long to die,**

* They will want to die, (NCV)
* Indeed, they will eagerly desire to die

**they will long to die:** The word *long* refers to desiring or wanting something. For example:

> hope for death (CEV)

> desire to die (KJV)

#### 9:6d

**but death will escape them.**

* but death will run away from them. (NCV)
* but it will not be possible for them to die.

**death will escape them:** The word *escape* refers to eluding someone or something. For example:

> death will flee from them (GNT)

This clause is used figuratively to refer to people not being able to die. In some languages a literal translation would not have that meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a different word or figure of speech that gives this meaning. For example:

    > death will not come to them

    > they will not be able to meet with death

    > death is far from them

* Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:

    > they will not be able to die

#### 9:7a

**And the locusts looked like horses prepared for battle,**

* ¶ The locusts looked like horses ready for war.
* ¶ The grasshoppers looked like horses that had been armored/dressed to go into battle.

**horses prepared for battle:** A *horse* is a large, four\-legged animal that weighs 500 kilograms (1100 pounds) or more. They are about 1\.5 meters (5 feet) high at the back. At that time, some kinds of soldiers rode *horses* into battle. Some of these soldiers put armor over their horses’ faces, chests, backs, rumps, and legs to protect them. At that time the armor was made of overlapping, flat ovals of metal. The metal ovals were attached to a leather undergarment. An example of this armor is pictured below.

Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> horses ready for battle (CEV)

> horses armoured for battle (NJB)

In some languages people are not familiar with *horses* or their armor. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > large riding animals ready for war

    > large riding animals with protective armor/clothing for fighting

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. For example:

    > A horse is a large animal that one kind of soldier rode into battle. Such a soldier would put armor over his horse’s face, chest, back, rump, and legs to protect it. The locusts looked like the war horse without the rider.

See how you translated the word *horse* in 6:2\.

#### 9:7b

**with something like crowns of gold on their heads,**

* On their heads they wore something like golden wreaths,
* They wore what looked like crowns made of gold on their heads,

**something like crowns of gold:** These things on the heads of the locusts looked like crowns. See how you translated the phrase “golden crowns” in 4:4\.

**their:** The pronoun *their* refers to the locusts.

#### 9:7c

**and faces like the faces of men.**

* and their faces looked like people’s faces.
* and their faces looked human. (NJB)

#### 9:8a

**They had hair like that of women,**

* The locusts’ hair was like women’s hair,
* The hair of the locusts looked like the hair of women,

**They had hair like that of women:** The Greek is literally “they had hair like women’s hair,” as in the NABRE. It makes clear that these locusts had something that normal locusts do not have.

How it was that *They had hair like that of women* is not explained here. It could mean that their hair was long, surrounded the face, or was thick. You should translate this clause literally without explaining it.

#### 9:8b

**and teeth like those of lions.**

* and their teeth were big and sharp like lions’ teeth.
* and they had long and sharp teeth like the teeth of lions.

**teeth like those of lions:** The phrase *teeth like those of lions* describes teeth that are long and sharp so that they can bite deeply into other large animals. In some languages people are not familiar with lions. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a general word for the animal. For example:

    > their teeth were like those of a fierce animal

* Explain the meaning in your translation of what lions’ teeth were like. For example:

    > their teeth were long and sharp

* Use the word for a similar, large, meat\-eating animal that is better known in your culture. For example:

    > their teeth were like the teeth of tigers/panthers/leopards

**They also had thoraxes like breastplates of iron,**

* They wore coverings on their chest that looked like they were made of iron,
* Their chests were covered with what looked like iron breastplates. (GNT)

#### 9:9b

**and the sound of their wings was like**

* and the noise made by their wings was like
* The movement of their wings made a loud sound like

#### 9:9a–b

**thoraxes like breastplates of iron:** The *thoraxes* are the chest areas of the bodies. The *breastplates* are the thin sheets of metal or overlapping plates of metal armor. They are shaped to fit over the chest to protect the wearers. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> Their chests were covered with what looked like iron breastplates (GNT)

> They had body–armour like iron breastplates (NJB)

The *breastplates* might be used instead of the other armor, as pictured in the note at 9:7a. Or the *breastplates* might be added to the other armor.

**iron:** At the time, *iron* was the strongest metal known. Today, iron is used to make cars, trucks, and many kinds of tools.

In some languages people are not familiar with *iron*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Describe it in your translation. For example:

    > very strong metal

* Use the major language word and explain it in your translation. For example:

    > iron, a very strong metal,

* Use the major language word and explain it in a footnote if people are not familiar with it. An example footnote is:

    > At the time, iron was the strongest metal known. Today, iron is used to make cars, trucks, and many kinds of tools.

#### 9:9c

**the roar of many horses and chariots rushing into battle.**

* the loud rumbling of many horse chariots going quickly into battle.
* that of the sound of many horses running into battle pulling war carts.

**the roar of many horses and chariots rushing into battle** This clause indicates that the *horses* were running. Many horses running together make a loud thudding and rumbling noise similar to “rolling” thunder. Chariots have wooden wheels, often with an outer ring of iron. These make much noise as they roll over the ground. The sound of the locusts’ wings was like the noise of the running horses pulling chariots. The sound continued for a long time. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the loud noise of many horses and chariots running into battle

> the loud rumbling of many horses and chariots going quickly to battle

**many horses and chariots:** The Greek phrase is literally “of\-chariots of\-horses of\-many.” There are several ways to interpret this phrase. The main ones are:

1. It refers to horses pulling chariots and that there were many of these horse chariots. For example, the GNT says:

    > many horse\-drawn chariots *(RSV, GNT, NABRE, ESV, NET)*

2. It indicates that there were many horses and also there were chariots. For example, the BSB says:

    > many horses and chariots *(BSB, NIV, REB, NCV)*

3. It indicates that there were chariots and each chariot had many horses. For example, the NJB says:

    > chariots with many horses *(NJB, GW, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because there seems no reason from the Greek grammar to separate the horses from the chariots, as in interpretation (2\). And it seems more likely that, for an example of a loud noise, *many* connects to *chariots with horses* and not just to *horses* (interpretation (3\)). Other ways to translate this phrase according to interpretation (1\) are:

> many horse chariots

> many chariots pulled by horses

> many horses pulling many chariots

**chariots:** The word *chariot* refers to a vehicle with two wheels that is pulled by a horse or horses. The soldier stands in the vehicle. The wheels are made of wood and often have a band of iron around each wheel. The wheels make a rumbling noise when they roll.

In some languages people are not familiar with *chariots*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > horse\-drawn/pulled war vehicles *But the word or phrase you use should not refer to modern military trucks or tanks.*

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. For example:

    > A chariot is a war vehicle with two wheels. It is pulled by one or two horses. The soldier stands in the vehicle. The wheels are made of wood and often have a band of iron around the wheels. The wheels make a rumbling noise when they roll.

#### 9:10a

**They had tails with stingers like scorpions,**

* They had tails and/with stingers like scorpions have,
* Their tails looked like the tails of scorpions and could sting.

**They:** The pronoun *They* refers to the locusts. For example:

> The locusts (NCV)

**scorpions:** Use the same word or phrase that you used in 9:5\.

#### 9:10b

**which had the power to injure people for five months.**

* and in their tails they had power to severely hurt/harm people for five months.
* They had power in their tails to make people suffer very much for five months.

**which had the power to injure people for five months:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *injure* is literally “harm” (as in 9:4a). Here the Greek word is more general than “torture/torment” (9:5b) but similar in meaning. The rest of this clause has a similar meaning to 9:5a–c. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> they had the power in their tails to cause people pain for five months

> their power to hurt people for five months is in their tails (ESV)

> they could make people suffer for five months with the poison in their tails

**They were ruled by a king, the angel of the Abyss.**

* They had as their king the angel of the bottomless pit,
* Their leader was the angel/being of/from that very/immeasurably deep hole.

**king:** Here the word *king* refers to a ruler. Some languages do not have a word for *king*. If that is true in your language, you may want to use a more general word. For example:

> leader (NJB)

**the angel of the Abyss:** This phrase may refer to the “star that had fallen from heaven to the earth” (9:1b, BSB). It is also possible that it refers to Satan. Translate in a way that allows for either interpretation.

In some languages the translation of *angel* only refers to beings that obey God. If that is true in your language, use a word or phrase that refers to a disobeying spirit. The usual New Testament word or phrase is “demon” or “evil spirit.” For example:

> the demon of the Abyss

**of the Abyss:** Here the word *of* indicates a connection to the Abyss. The angel belonged to, or was somehow connected with, the Abyss.

**Abyss:** The word *Abyss* refers to a place of great depth. See how you translated this word in 9:1\.

#### 9:11b

* whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon,
* His name in the Hebrew language is Abaddon, the Destroyer.

* and Apollyon in Greek.
* His name in the Greek language is Apollyon. This name also means the Destroyer.

#### 9:11b–c

**in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek it is Apollyon:** Both the name *Abaddon* and the name *Apollyon* mean “Destroyer.” You may want to:

* Add a footnote to explain the meaning of these names. For example:

    > Both the name Abaddon and the name Apollyon mean “Destroyer.”

    > Both names mean “Destroyer.”

* Explain the meaning of the names in your translation. For example:

    > His name in Hebrew is Abaddon; in Greek the name is Apollyon (meaning “The Destroyer”) (GNT)

**The first woe has passed:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *woe* here means “trouble” or “distress.” This clause refers to the distress caused by the locusts (9:3–11\). Other ways to translate this clause are:

> That was the first of the disasters (NJB)

> The first trouble is past (NCV)

See how you translated the word *woe* in 8:13\.

#### 9:12b

**Behold, two woes are still to follow.**

* but look/hey, two other great troubles are indeed still coming.
* But listen/wow, two more great difficulties will come.

**Behold:** In Greek the word which the BSB translates as *Behold* is more literally “look.” The word emphasizes or calls attention to the words that follow. The word is not a command to look at something. Other ways to translate this word are:

> listen,

> indeed/hey,

**two woes are still to follow:** The Greek clause is literally “two woes come yet after these things.” The phrase “these things” refers to the events in 9:1–11\. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> two woes are still coming after these things (NASB)

> there are still two other troubles that will come (NCV)

> Two more horrible things will happen soon. (CEV)

### Section 8:6–9:21: Angels blew the first six trumpets

In this section, the blowing of each trumpet signaled a disaster. God would send these disasters upon the people of the earth. Some of the disasters were hail, fire, and poisoned water.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The Seven Angels and Trumpets (NCV)

> The Seven Trumpets (NRSV)

#### 9:13a

**Then the sixth angel sounded his trumpet,**

* ¶ The sixth angel blew his trumpet,
* ¶ When the sixth angel blew his trumpet,

**the sixth:** This refers to the next item after five other things. If counted, this item would be counted as number six. See how you translated this word in 6:12\.

#### 9:13b

**and I heard a voice**

* and I heard a/the voice of someone talking
* I heard someone talking.

**I heard a voice:** In some languages hearing *a voice* is not natural. For example:

> I heard words

> I heard someone speaking

#### 9:13c

**from the four horns of the golden altar before God**

* from the four horns/corners of the golden altar in front of God.
* The sound of his voice came from the four horns/corners of the gold altar standing/located before God.

**the four horns:** There is a textual issue here:

1. Some manuscripts have the four horns. For example:

    > the four horns (RSV) *(BSB; RSV, GNT, NJB, NIV2011, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, ESV, KJV)*

2. Some manuscripts have the horns. For example:

    > the horns (NET) *(NIV, NET, REB, NCV)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT editors decided that option (1\) was more likely.The scholars reviewing the manuscripts say that it was difficult for them to decide. Beale (page 505\) also includes “four” in his translation and discussion, but Aune (page 482\) and Mounce (page 192\) do not.

**horns:** Here the word *horns* refers to the raised corners at the top of the altar. For example:

> a voice coming from the four corners of the gold altar (GNT)

**altar:** On earth, an *altar* is a platform on which people offer sacrifices or gifts to God. This *altar* is golden, like the small *altar* for burning incense in the Jewish Temple. But this *altar* is in heaven in John’s vision. Translate this word as you did in 6:9 or 8:3\.

### Section 8:6–9:21: Angels blew the first six trumpets

In this section, the blowing of each trumpet signaled a disaster. God would send these disasters upon the people of the earth. Some of the disasters were hail, fire, and poisoned water.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The Seven Angels and Trumpets (NCV)

> The Seven Trumpets (NRSV)

#### 9:14a

**saying to the sixth angel with the trumpet,**

* The voice said to the sixth angel with a trumpet,
* The being/speaker said to the sixth angel holding the trumpet,

#### 9:14b

**“Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.”**

* “Set free the four angels who are held at the great river Euphrates.”
* “Allow the four restrained/confined angels/demons at the great river Euphrates to go.”

#### 9:14a–b

**Release:** This word probably means “set free” here. The four angels were in some way restrained, but now they were allowed to go. For example:

> Free (NCV)

**the four angels who are bound:** The word *bound* refers to being tied or prevented from moving freely. These angels were prevented from leaving their place at the Euphrates river. They were prevented from leaving there long ago, before John heard about them. God caused them to remain there.

Translate *bound* with a word that refers generally to being prevented from moving freely. The angels were probably not tied with earthly things like rope.

The clause *who are bound* is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> the four angels whom God caused to remain there

**the four angels:** These are probably four demons.Beale, Aune, Osbourne, Kistemaker, and Smalley. In some languages the translation of *angel* only refers to beings that obey God. If that is true in your language, use a word or phrase that refers to demons or evil spirits. For example:

> the four demons

**the great river Euphrates:** The word *great* probably means both “big” and “important” here.

#### 9:15a

**So the four angels who had been prepared**

* These four angels, who had been prepared beforehand
* God had prepared these four angels/demons

**the four angels who had been prepared:** Earlier, God had prepared these angels for the task of killing one third of mankind. The clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> whom God had prepared beforehand

**the four angels:** This phrase refers to the same four angels of 9:14b. For example:

> These four angels (NJB)

#### 9:15b

**for this hour and day and month and year**

* for this hour and day and month and year,
* for this particular/exact hour and day and month and year.

**for this hour and day and month and year:** This phrase refers to the exact time in history that these angels are released. The four time words in this phrase emphasizes the fact that it is an exact time. God chose that time, and it will happen at that time.

In some languages it is more natural to start with the longest time period (*year*) and end with the shortest time period (*hour*). For example:

> for this very year and month and day and hour

**this:** The Greek word is literally “the.” The BSB translates the Greek word as *this* to help indicate an exact time. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> that (GW)

> this exact

**hour:** Here the word *hour* refers to a point in time. The angels were prepared to begin at that exact time.

In some languages a literal translation would not have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a word or phrase for an exact time. For example:

    > moment

    > exact time

* Use the word or phrase from the major language.

In some languages, the phrase “day and month and year” may imply the exact time of day. If that is true in your language, translating the word *hour* may not be necessary. For example:

> for this very day and month and year

#### 9:15c

**were released to kill a third of mankind.**

* were set free to kill a third part of mankind.
* So the sixth angel allowed them to go and kill one of every three people.

**were released:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> the sixth angel released them

**a third of mankind:** Here the word *third* means “one part out of three parts.” For example, in a group of three thousand people, one thousand people would die. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> one part in three parts of mankind

> one of every three of all people

> one part of mankind and two parts not

See how you translated the phrase *a third of* in 8:7 (in “a third of the trees”).

**mankind:** The word *mankind* refers to all the people living on the earth. Other ways to translate this word are:

> all people/humans

> all the people of the earth

##### **General Comment on 9:15a–c**

All of 9:15a–b is the subject phrase for the main verb phrase “were released” in 9:15c. In some languages it is more natural to make 9:15a–b a background sentence. For example:

> 15aThese four angels had been kept ready 15bfor this very hour and day and month and year. 15cAnd at this time they were released to kill a third of mankind.

This example uses active clauses instead of passive ones:

> 15aGod had prepared these four angels 15bfor this very hour and day and month and year. 15cAnd at this time the sixth angel released them to kill a third of mankind.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The Seven Angels and Trumpets (NCV)

> The Seven Trumpets (NRSV)

#### 9:16a–b

The words here imply that the four angels controlled the army. In some languages a literal translation would not imply that the four angels controlled the army. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain the implied information in a footnote. An example footnote is:

> The four angels controlled this vast army of two hundred million soldiers, because both 9:15 and 9:18 refer to killing one third of mankind.

#### 9:16a

**And the number of mounted troops was two hundred million;**

* The number of soldiers on war horses was two hundred times one thousand thousands.
* The number of the cavalry was 200,000,000,

**mounted troops:** This phrase refers to soldiers riding horses. At that time, these soldiers fought using swords, spears, or bows. They fought while sitting on the backs of the horses. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> troops of cavalry (RSV)

> soldiers on war horses

In some languages people are not familiar with soldiers riding horses. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain what cavalry is in a footnote. For example:

> Soldiers on horses were a very strong fighting part of an army at that time.

**two hundred million:** The Greek phrase is literally “twice ten thousand of ten thousand.” This may refer to a huge but indefinite number of soldiers. But all English reference versions translate according to the calculation of “twice ten thousand of ten thousand,” which is *two hundred million*.

In some languages combinations of number words such as *two hundred million* are not known. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Follow the literal Greek phrase. For example:

    > twice ten thousand times ten thousand (RSV)

* Use both numerals and number words. For example:

    > 200 million

* Use only numerals. For example:

    > 200,000,000

* Use a combination of smaller number words that equal *two hundred million*. For example:

    > two hundred thousands of thousands

* Use the major language word for “million.” For example:

    > 200 milien

    > two hundred miliens

#### 9:16b

**I heard their number.**

* This was the number I heard. (REB)
* I heard someone say how many soldiers there were.
* as I heard someone say.

**I heard their number:** The word *heard* implies that someone said how many soldiers there were. John heard what he said. In some languages it is more natural to refer to the person speaking. For example:

> I heard someone tell the number of soldiers

> I heard someone say how many of them there were

Having this clause after the number (9:16a) emphasizes the number. Another example of emphasizing the number is:

> this was the number I heard (REB)

##### **General Comment on 9:16a–b**

In some languages it is more natural to have the clause about hearing the number first. If possible, then emphasize the number naturally. For example:

> 16b I heard 16a the number of the mounted troops, and indeed, it was two hundred million!

#### 9:17a

**Now the horses and riders in my vision looked like this:**

* ¶ And this is how I saw in the vision the horses and those who sat on them: (NASB)
* ¶ And in my vision I saw the horses and their riders. They looked like this:

**Now the horses and riders:** The word *riders* refers to the soldiers sitting on the horses. These *riders* may or may not have looked like people. Another way to translate this phrase is:

> the horses and those who sat on them

**in my vision:** The Greek phrase is literally “the vision” (as in the NASB). The phrase refers to all that John has seen and written in this book. You may add the pronoun *my* if it is natural in your language.

**vision:** Here the word *vision* refers to something that appears supernaturally. It is like a dream, but the person is usually awake. It is something or someone that people usually cannot see, but God causes them to see it.

**looked like this:** This phrase indicates that the description of the horses and riders follows in 9:17b–d.

#### 9:17b–d

The breastplates have three colors. The colors are probably meant to match the three things that come out of their mouths. The fiery red color matches the color of fire. The dark blue color matches the color of the smoke. The sulfur yellow matches the color of sulfur.

#### 9:17b

**The riders had breastplates the colors of fire, sapphire, and sulfur.**

* They wore coverings on their chests that had the colors of hot coal red, hyacinth/sapphire blue, and sulfur yellow
* their breastplates had the colors of bright red, dark blue, and yellow.

**The riders had breastplates:** The Greek phrase the BSB translates as *The riders had breastplates* is literally “having breastplates.” The Greek does not indicate if it was the *riders* or the “horses” mentioned in 9:17a who wore breastplates. The phrase could refer to either:

1. the riders,
2. both the riders and the horses.

You should translate this phrase without saying who wore the *breastplates*. For example

> The breastplates were

> Their breastplates were (NIV)

**breastplates:** The *breastplates* are formed by a thin sheet of metal or overlapping plates of metal shaped to fit over the chest to protect the wearers. See how you translated this word in 9:9\.

**the colors of fire:** This refers to a bright red. It is similar in color to bright red coals of a fire.

**sapphire:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *sapphire* refers to a deep blue or purplish\-blue color.

**and sulfur:** The word *sulfur* describes the color of pure *sulfur*, a medium yellow. For example:

> sulfur–yellow (NJB)

In some languages people are not familiar with *sulfur*. If that is true in your language, you may want to use the usual word for yellow in your language. For example:

> yellow

> egg yolk yellow

#### 9:17c

**The heads of the horses were like the heads of lions,**

* The heads of the horses looked like the heads of lions,
* Each horse looked like it had the head of a lion,

**like the heads of lions:** The male lion has a mane of hair around his neck. Lions eat other animals and have large sharp teeth.

In some languages people are not familiar with *lions*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. For example:

    > A lion is a large feline/cat. It weighs about 200 kilograms. The male lion has a mane of hair over his neck. Lions eat other animals and have large sharp teeth.

    > See footnote on lion at 4:7\.

* Use the major language word and add a descriptive word or phrase. For example:

    > the heads of fierce lions

#### 9:17d

**and out of their mouths proceeded fire, smoke, and sulfur.**

* and out of their mouths came fire, blue smoke, and sulfur.
* and fire, smoke, and poisonous sulfur came from each of their mouths.

**out of their mouths proceeded fire, smoke, and sulfur:** The phrase *out of their mouths* is emphasized in the Greek and the BSB. If possible, emphasize this phrase naturally in your language.

In some languages it is more natural to have this clause in its usual place. For example:

> fire, smoke, and sulfur came out of their mouths

**out of their mouths:** In 9:17c John described the heads of the horses. So the pronoun *their* probably refers to only the horses here.

**smoke:** The smoke was probably a dark blue color, matching the color on the breastplates. You may want to use a similar word or phrase for the color of the smoke here. For example:

> dark blue smoke

**sulfur:** The word *sulfur* refers to a yellow powder or soft solid. It is often found at hot springs and near volcanoes. When *sulfur* burns, it makes a poisonous, bad smelling gas.

In some languages people are not familiar with *sulfur*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use the major language word and add a descriptive word or phrase. For example:

    > poisonous sulfur

* Describe *sulfur*. For example:

    > poisonous yellow powder *You may then want to describe the literal word. For example:*

    > Literally: “sulfur.” Sulfur is a powder that makes a poisonous, bad smelling gas when it burns.

**A third of mankind was killed by the three plagues of fire, smoke, and sulfur that proceeded from their mouths.**

* A third part of mankind was killed by these three disasters: the fire, smoke, and sulfur that came out of their mouths.
* The three catastrophes of fire, smoke, and sulfur that left their mouths killed one of every three people.

**A third of mankind was killed by the three plagues of fire, smoke, and sulfur that proceeded from their mouths:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> The three plagues of fire, smoke, and sulfur that came out of their mouths killed a third of mankind

**A third of mankind:** Here the word *third* means “one part out of three parts.” See how you translated this phrase in 9:15\.

**plagues:** This word refers to disasters that harm a lot of people. Here it refers to the fire, smoke, and sulfur. Use a word that can refer to the fire, smoke, and sulfur. It should indicate harm or death. For example:

> calamities/disasters that cause people to suffer

> things that cause much death

#### 9:19a

**For the power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails;**

* The killing power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails,
* The horses’ ability to kill people was in their mouths and in their tails,

**For:** Here the Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *For* introduces an explanation for the plagues. Some English versions omit the conjunction. Connect 9:19a to 9:18 in a way that is natural in your language.

**the power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails:** The horses killed people with the plagues from their mouths. They also hurt people with bites of their snake\-like tails.

**the power of the horses:** Here the word *power* refers to the ability to hurt people. The word does not refer to physical strength here. In some languages including this implied information in your translation will make the meaning clearer. For example:

> The power of the horses to hurt people

> The horses’ ability to kill people

#### 9:19b

**indeed, their tails were like snakes, having heads with which to inflict harm.**

* because their tails are like snakes, having heads that inflict injuries. (NET)
* for their tails had heads that could hurt people, like poisonous snakes.

**indeed:** This conjunction introduces an explanation of 9:19a. For example:

> because (NET)

Some English versions only use a semi\-colon or leave the connection implied.

**having heads with which to inflict harm:** This clause explains how the tails of the horses were like snakes. Their tails had something that looked like the heads of poisonous snakes. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> and had heads which inflicted wounds (NJB)

> with heads, and they use them to hurt people (GNT)

> having heads that were able to hurt/wound people

**Now the rest of mankind who were not killed by these plagues**

* ¶ The rest of mankind, whom these disasters did not kill,
* ¶ The rest of the people survived these catastrophes

**who were not killed by these plagues:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> whom these plagues did not kill

> who survived these plagues (REB)

**plagues:** This word refers to disasters that harm a lot of people. Here it refers to the fire, smoke, and sulfur. See how you translated this word in 6:8 or 9:18\.

#### 9:20b

**still did not repent of the works of their hands.**

* did not repent at all of the evil things that they had done,
* but refused to turn away from their evil deeds.

**still did not repent:** The word *still* indicates that even after seeing all those terrible plagues, the people did not repent. For example:

> still refused to repent (NLT)

> still did not renounce (REB)

**repent:** This word refers to changing one’s mind and actions. The people did not stop sinning. They did not begin to obey God. Some other examples are:

> turn away from their sin

> change their hearts/ways

> leave the sinful/evil ways

See how you translated this word in 2:5 or 3:3\.

**the works of their hands:** This is an idiom that refers to what people do. Here it is implied that the people did evil things. See 9:20c–21b for what these works are. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> their evil deeds (NLT)

> the evil things that they had been doing

#### 9:20c

**They did not stop worshiping demons**

* for example, they did not stop worshiping/venerating demons,
* For example, they did not stop revering demons,

The Greek begins with the word “that.” It indicates that 9:20c–d is a list of “the work of their hands.” Other ways to translate this word are:

> that is, they did not…

> namely, they did not…

> For they did not…

The BSB, GNT, and NCV begin a new sentence here. They allow the context to imply that 9:20c–d are examples.

**worshiping:** This word refers to honoring someone or something as sacred/divine. Other ways to translate this word are:

> venerating

> revering

See how you translated this word in 4:10 or 5:14\.

**demons:** This word refers to evil spirit beings. These *demons* are not spirits of dead people.

#### 9:20d

**and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood,**

* nor gold, silver, bronze, stone, or wood idols,
* and they did not stop revering idols made of gold, silver, bronze, stone, or wood.

**idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood:** Some idols were made of *gold*, some idols were made of *silver*, some idols were made of *bronze*, some idols were made of *stone*, and some idols were made of *wood*. Some idols may have been made with more than one of these materials. But this phrase does not indicate that each idol was made from all these materials.

**idols:** This word refers to images or statues that people worship or revere as representing a god.

**gold:** The word *gold* refers to a rare metal of a somewhat yellow color. It was the most expensive metal at that time. It is naturally shiny and beautiful. See how you translated this word in 1:12 or 9:7\.

**silver:** The word *silver* also refers to a precious metal, though it is not as rare and expensive as gold. But it is still somewhat expensive. When polished it was used as a mirror. It was used in coins and decorations.

Some languages do not have a word for *silver*. If that is true in your language, you should use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, you may want to explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

> Silver is also a precious metal, though it is not as rare and expensive as gold. When polished it was used as a mirror. It was used in coins and decorations.

**bronze:** This word refers to a metal made from a mixture of copper and tin. The Greek word also refers to pure copper or brass. (Brass is a mixture of copper and zinc.) The metal called *bronze* is a yellowish\-brown color. Copper is a reddish\-brown metal color. Some kinds of coins are made of *bronze* or copper. (The other common color of coins is silver\-colored.)

In some languages people are not familiar with *bronze*, copper, or brass. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the word in your translation. For example:

    > brown/tan metal called bronze

    > reddish brown metal called copper

* Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > brown/tan metal

    > reddish brown metal

* Use the major language word.

See how you translated this word in 1:15\.

#### 9:20e

**which cannot see or hear or walk.**

* which cannot either see or hear or walk. (RSV)
* Their idols are only things that cannot see or hear or walk!

**which cannot see or hear or walk:** These images or statues *cannot see or hear or walk*. Therefore, they are unable to help those who worship them. For example:

> which cannot either see or hear or walk (RSV)

> things that cannot see or hear or walk (NCV)

The NCV uses the word “things,” which implies that the idols are not alive.

**Furthermore, they did not repent of their murder, sorcery,**

* They also did not repent when they murdered people, did sorcery,
* Furthermore, they did not turn away from their murdering, doing magic,

**their murder:** The word *murder* refers to killing someone deliberately and unlawfully. All means of killing are included. In some languages it is more natural to use a verb. For example:

> murdering/killing others

> when they murdered people

**sorcery:** The word refers to doing something by supernatural means. These supernatural means are from demonic power, not from God. This *sorcery* could include using spells, magic potions, and contacting evil spirits. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> witchcraft (NJB)

> sorceries (RSV)

> magic arts (NIV)

The noun *sorcery* refers to an event. In some languages it is more natural to use a verb. For example:

> doing sorcery

> practicing witchcraft (CEV)

#### 9:21b

**sexual immorality, and theft.**

* sinned sexually, or stole.
* committing sexual immorality, or stealing.

**sexual immorality:** This phrase refers to any sexual relations that are not with one’s spouse. The noun phrase *sexual immorality* refers to an event. In some languages it is more natural to use a verb. For example:

> committing immorality/adultery

> when they sinned sexually

**theft:** This word refers to taking things that belong to someone else without his permission. In some languages it is more natural to use a verb. For example:

* ¶ Then I saw another powerful angel descending from heaven.

**another mighty angel:** The word *another* indicates that this was an angel that John had not seen before. It was not one of the angels that John had seen holding the trumpets.

**mighty:** This word indicates that this was a powerful angel. It is the same word that is used in 5:2\.

**heaven:** Here the word *heaven* refers to the place where God lives.

#### 10:1b

**wrapped in a cloud, with a rainbow above his head.**

* He was wrapped in a cloud. He had a rainbow on his head,
* His robe was a cloud. His headdress was a rainbow.
* A cloud covered him like a robe, and a rainbow was on his head.

**wrapped in a cloud:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *wrapped* indicates that the cloud wrapped around him. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> He was robed in a cloud (NIV)

> He was dressed in a cloud (GW)

**with a rainbow above his head:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *above* is literally “on.” The rainbow probably looked like it was on the angel’s head like a hat or headdress. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> and a rainbow was on his head

> and had a rainbow standing/rising up from his head

#### 10:1c

**His face was like the sun,**

* his face shone like the sun,
* His face was as bright as the sun.

**His face was like the sun:** This clause indicates that the angel’s face shone brightly. For example:

> his face shone like the sun (REB)

#### 10:1d

**and his legs were like pillars of fire.**

* and his legs were like columns on fire.
* His legs appeared to be burning poles/posts.

**his legs were like pillars of fire:** A *pillar* has the same shape as a thick pole or post but is made of stone. Pillars are used to support a building or roof. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> his legs were like fiery pillars (NIV)

> his legs looked like pillars/posts that were on fire

The phrase “pillars of fire” might indicate that the angel’s legs were made only of fire that flamed upward like a pillar, as in Exodus 13:21, where God revealed his presence in a fire shaped like a pillar. But it seems unlikely that God would directly picture his presence as legs of an angel. The *pillars of fire* are probably only a hint or reminder of Exodus 13:21, rather than a direct connection to it.Aune (page 558\) says, ‘The reference to the angel’s legs as ‘pillars of fire’ is often considered an allusion to Exodus 13:21…where the guiding presence of God is described as…‘a pillar of fire,’ though it is not clear that this is anything but a formal allusion without material significance. In 1 Enoch 18:11 and 21:7, Enoch sees ‘pillars of fire’ falling from heaven, both in contexts of divine punishment.”

See how you translated the word *pillar* in 3:12\.

### Section 10:1–11: An angel gave a little scroll to John

In this section, John saw a powerful angel come down from heaven to the earth. John described what the angel looked like. When the angel shouted, John heard seven beings speak with loud voices like thunder. God told John not to write what they said. The powerful angel announced that when the seventh angel blew his trumpet, God would finish his plan. Then God told John to eat the scroll that the angel held. He also told John that he would show him more future events.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> John saw an angel holding a small scroll

> The Angel with the Little Scroll (NRSV)

#### 10:2a

**He held in his hand a small scroll, which lay open.**

* In the palm of his hand he had a small scroll that was unrolled.
* He held a small, open scroll in his open hand.

**He held in his hand a small scroll, which lay open:** The clause and phrase *He held in his hand a small scroll, which lay open* explain how the angel held the scroll. The scroll was partly unrolled and lay on his open hand. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> He had a small scroll open in his hand. (GNT)

> He held a small, opened scroll in his hand. (GW)

**a small scroll:** This scroll was a different one than the scroll with the seven seals.

**scroll:** The word *scroll* refers to a long piece of paper that is written on. Then it is rolled into a cylinder shape. See how you translated this word in 5:1\.

#### 10:2b

**He placed his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land.**

* He put his right foot on the surface of the sea and his left foot on land,
* He placed his right foot on top of the ocean. He placed his left foot on the land.

**He placed his right foot on the sea:** Here the Greek word the BSB translates literally as *placed* means “placed” or “put.” The GNT translates this as:

> He put his right foot on the sea

**on the sea:** Here the word *on* probably indicates that the angel’s foot was on the surface of the sea. His foot was probably not sunk into the sea.

**sea:** The word *sea* refers to a large body of water. A *sea* is often so large that someone standing on one side cannot see the other side. The *sea* is symbolic, so you should not name a particular *sea*. See how you translated this word in 5:13 or 8:8\.

**his left foot on the land:** The phrase “He placed/put” is implied from the previous clause but not repeated. In some languages it is more natural to repeat some or all of the phrase. For example:

> he put his left foot on the land

#### 10:3a

**Then he cried out in a loud voice like the roar of a lion.**

* and shouted in a loud voice that sounded like the roar of a lion.
* He shouted loudly, like the very loud bellowing of a fierce lion/animal.

**he cried out in a loud voice:** The angel probably shouted without using words, as when a lion roars. But he may have shouted words. Translate the words *loud voice* in a way that allows for either possibility. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> he shouted in a loud voice (GW)

> he shouted loudly (NCV)

**like the roar of a lion:** The word *roar* refers to the very loud noise that animals such as oxen and lions make. A lion’s *roar* can be heard far away. It causes people to be afraid.

In some languages people are not familiar with lions. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Describe the meaning. For example:

    > the very loud bellowing of a fierce/angry animal

* Use the name of an animal in your area that makes a very loud, frightening noise. For example:

    > the bellowing of a bull *You may then want to indicate the literal words in a footnote, using the major language word for lion. An example footnote is:*

    > Literally: “the roar of a lion.”

* Use the major language word for *lion*.

#### 10:3b

**And when he cried out, the seven thunders sounded their voices.**

* And when he shouted, the voices of seven thunders spoke. (NCV)
* After he shouted, seven peals of thunder uttered words.

**the seven thunders sounded their voices:** The Greek clause is literally “the seven thunders spoke their voices.” It refers to speaking actual words. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> the seven peals of thunder uttered their voices (NASB)

> the seven thunders spoke with voices of their own (GW)

> the seven thunders spoke (REB)

**When the seven thunders had spoken, I was about to put it in writing.**

* And when the seven thunders spoke, I prepared to write.
* After the seven thunders uttered those words, I was about to write them.

#### 10:4a–b

**When the seven thunders had spoken, I was about to put it in writing. But I heard a voice from heaven saying:** These words indicate that, after they finished speaking, John got his paper and quill ready to write what the seven thunders said. But the voice from heaven interrupted him before he actually wrote anything.

#### 10:4b

**But I heard a voice from heaven saying,**

* But I heard a voice from heaven tell me,
* But I heard someone say from heaven,

**a voice from heaven saying:** John does not say who spoke here. Use a word or phrase that can refer to anyone in heaven. For example:

> speech coming from heaven

> someone say from heaven

#### 10:4c

**“Seal up what the seven thunders have said, and do not write it down.”**

* “Conceal/Hide what the seven thunders have said. Do not write it.”
* “Do not let anyone know what the seven thunders said. Do not write what they said.” So I did not write their words.

**Seal up:** Here the command *Seal up* means “do not tell anyone.” For example:

> Keep secret (GNT)

##### **General Comment on 10:4b–c**

The context implies that John did not write what the seven thunders said. In some languages it is more natural to include the implied information in your translation. For example:

> but I heard a voice from heaven say, “Seal up what the seven thunders have said and do not write it down.” So I did not.

#### 10:5a

**Then the angel I had seen standing on the sea and on the land**

* ¶ And/Then the angel whom I previously saw standing on both the surface of the sea and on the land

**on the sea:** Translate this phrase as you did in 10:2\.

#### 10:5b

**lifted up his right hand to heaven.**

* lifted his right hand toward heaven.

**lifted up his right hand to heaven:** There is a textual issue in 10:5b: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the phrase right hand (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the word hand (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. Here the phrase *lifted up his right hand* indicates that the person was promising something. In some languages people will not know why he *lifted up his right hand* even after reading 10:6\. If that is true in your language, you may want to include some implied information. For example:

> lifted up his right hand to heaven to promise

> lifted up his right hand to heaven to make an oath

## Revelation 10:6 (id: 522963)

### Section 10:1–11: An angel gave a little scroll to John

In this section, John saw a powerful angel come down from heaven to the earth. John described what the angel looked like. When the angel shouted, John heard seven beings speak with loud voices like thunder. God told John not to write what they said. The powerful angel announced that when the seventh angel blew his trumpet, God would finish his plan. Then God told John to eat the scroll that the angel held. He also told John that he would show him more future events.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> John saw an angel holding a small scroll

> The Angel with the Little Scroll (NRSV)

#### 10:6a

**And he swore by Him who lives forever and ever,**

* He made an oath, calling on the name of the one who lives forever,
* Then he asked the eternal One/God to support what he was about to say.

**swore by Him:** The word *swore* refers to calling upon someone greater to be a witness that what the speaker was saying is true. It is implied that this other being will punish the speaker if what he said is not true. It does not indicate that the speaker is using bad or inappropriate words.

Here the angel called on God to witness that his statement of 10:6e–7c was true. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> spoke a vow that his words are true according to him

> promised with an oath calling the name of him

> called for support for his words from him

**Him who lives forever and ever:** This phrase refers to God. He lives eternally. For example:

> God who lives forever (CEV)

**forever and ever:** The Greek phrase is literally “into the ages of the ages.” The word “age” refers to a very long time. So the phrase “the ages of the ages” refers to eternity. For example:

> the living one of the timeless ages (JBP)

#### 10:6b–d

**who created heaven and everything in it, the earth and everything in it, and the sea and everything in it:** This clause tells the reader more about God. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other gods that John was thinking of and only this one *created heaven* and all other things. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about the only true God. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> He created the heavens and all that is in them, the earth and all that is in it, and the sea and all that is in it.

Also see the General Comment at 10:6e about reordering the information in this verse.

#### 10:6b

**who created heaven and everything in it,**

* who made the heavens and all that is in them,
* For he/God created the sky and everything in it,

**created:** This word means “made.” God made all these things from nothing. For example:

> made (NJB)

**heaven and everything in it:** The Greek words that the BSB translates as *heaven* and *it* are singular. But the phrase refers to the sky and everything in it, such as the stars, the moon, and the planets.Beale (page 538\) and Aune (page 565\) say it refers to creation. For example:

> the skies and all that is in them (NCV)

> the sky and space and all that is in those things

#### 10:6c

**the earth and everything in it,**

* the world and all that is in it,
* the earth and everything in it,

**the earth and everything in it:** This phrase refers to the world and all the animals and plants that live here.

#### 10:6d

**and the sea and everything in it:**

* and the oceans and all that is in them,
* and the sea and everything in it.

**the sea and everything in it:** This phrase refers to all the seas and oceans of the world. It includes everything that lives in them; for example, fish, animals, and plants.

#### 10:6e

**“There will be no more delay!**

* and said, “The time of delay/waiting is finished!
* With that oath to support his words, the angel said, “The final events will wait no longer.

**There will be no more delay:** The word *delay* refers to a time of waiting. This clause indicates that the final events are about to occur. For example:

> The time of waiting is over (NJB)

##### **General Comment on 10:6a–e**

10:6a indicates that an angel made an oath. It also describes God. 10:6b–d also describes God. 10:6e then begins to tell what the angel said. His words was supported by his oath in 10:6a.

In some languages it is more natural to separate the description from the main event. If that is true in your language, you may want to translate this verse as more than one sentence. You may also want to reorder those sentences. For example:

> 6aAnd he swore by him who lives for ever and ever, 6bwho created the heavens and all that is in them, 6cthe earth and all that is in it, 6dand the sea and all that is in it. 6eFinishing the oath, the angel, said, “There will be no more delay!

> 6aAnd he made an oath, asking the eternal God to be a witness to what he said. 6bGod is the one who created the heavens and all that is in them. 6cHe created the earth and all that is in it. 6dHe created the sea and all that is in it. 6eAfter making that oath, the angel said, “There will be no more delay!

> 6aGod lives for ever and ever. 6bHe created the heavens and all that is in them, 6cthe earth and all that is in it, 6dand the sea and all that is in it. 6aIn the name of God, the angel made an oath 6eand said, “There will be no more delay!

In this section, John saw a powerful angel come down from heaven to the earth. John described what the angel looked like. When the angel shouted, John heard seven beings speak with loud voices like thunder. God told John not to write what they said. The powerful angel announced that when the seventh angel blew his trumpet, God would finish his plan. Then God told John to eat the scroll that the angel held. He also told John that he would show him more future events.

#### 10:7a

**But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound his trumpet,**

* Rather, in the days when the seventh angel is prepared to blow his trumpet,
* Instead of more delay, during the time when the seventh angel is about to blow his trumpet,

**But:** The conjunction *But* indicates contrast to the long delay up to this time. It does not indicate contrast to the end of the delay (10:6e). Some ways to translate this conjunction are:

* Indicate that the contrast is only with the word “delay.” For example:

    > rather than more delay,

    > instead of more delay,

* Leave the conjunction implied. Some English versions omit it.

**in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound his trumpet:** There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as *is about to*:

1. The word means soon before. For example:

    > In the days when the seventh angel is ready to blow his trumpet (GW) *(BSB, NIV, NASB, GW, CEV, NET, REB, NCV)*

2. The word means at that time. For example:

    > when the seventh angel blows his trumpet (GNT) *(GNT, NJB, NABRE, NLT, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because it is the usual meaning of the Greek word.Swete (page 129\) has “when the Seventh Angel is about to blow.”

#### 10:7b

**the mystery of God will be fulfilled,**

* the mysterious plan of God will be completed,
* what occurs/happens then will fulfill God’s secret/hidden plan.

**the mystery of God:** Here the Greek word that the BSB translates as *mystery* refers to truth or knowledge that is not known. People cannot discover this truth or knowledge by seeking it on their own. Someone else must reveal it to them.

God’s plan is a *mystery*, because it comes from him and only he knows it fully. Here, the phrase *the mystery of God* refers to all or some part of that plan. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> God’s secret plan

> the hidden purpose of God (REB)

**will be fulfilled:** This phrase indicates that God’s plan will be completed or finished. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> will be accomplished (NIV)

> will be completed (GW)

#### 10:7c

**just as He proclaimed to His servants the prophets.”**

* just as he announced to his servants, the prophets.”
* It will occur/happen just as he told those who serve him, namely, his prophets.”

**just as He proclaimed to His servants the prophets:** This clause indicates that God had earlier told his prophets about his secret plan, called “the mystery of God” in 10:7b. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> as he announced to his servants the prophets, should be fulfilled. (RSV)

> as he promised to his servants the prophets. (REB)

In some languages it is more natural to translate this clause as a complete sentence. For example:

> It will happen just as he announced it to his servants the prophets. (NLT)

**proclaimed:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *proclaimed* refers to telling others good news. Here the good news was the prophecies about the mystery of God. Other ways to translate this word are:

> announced (NIV)

> made this good news known (GW)

**His servants the prophets:** This phrase indicates that the *prophets* were God’s *servants*. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the prophets who served him

> his servants, namely, the prophets

**servants:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *servants* can also be translated as “slaves.” Here the word refers to prophets serving God. They do this when they listen to God speaking to them, write what he said, and tell others the message. Another way to translate this word is:

> those who serve him

See how you translated this word in 7:3\.

**prophets:** A *prophet* is a person whom God uses to communicate with the people. The message (often called a “prophecy”) may include a vision, as in Ezekiel 1 and Daniel 8\. A prophecy may reveal something about past events, current events, or future events. The prophet speaks God’s message to the people or writes it down for their use. See how you translated the similar word “prophetess” in 2:20\.

##### **General Comment on 10:7a–c**

God told his prophets what would happen before it actually happened. In some languages it is more natural to describe God telling the prophets first in this verse. For example:

> God told his secret plans to his servants the prophets, and it will all happen by the time the seventh angel sounds his trumpet. (CEV)

#### 10:8a

**Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me again, saying,**

* ¶ Then the voice from heaven that I had heard earlier spoke to me again,
* ¶ Then I heard that same person/someone from heaven say to me,

**the voice that I had heard from heaven:** This phrase refers to the voice in 10:4b. Translate it similarly to there. For example:

> speech coming from heaven that I had heard earlier

> I heard that same person/someone from heaven say

#### 10:8b

**“Go, take the small scroll that lies open**

* “Go and take the scroll that is partly unrolled
* “Go and take the open scroll

#### 10:8c

**in the hand of the angel standing on the sea and on the land.”**

* in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and the land.”
* from the hand of the angel standing on both the surface of the sea and the land.”

#### 10:8b–c

**lies open:** This phrase indicates that the scroll was still partly unrolled, so that someone could read it. For example:

> is open (RSV)

When the angel shouted, John heard seven beings speak with loud voices like thunder. God told John not to write what they said. The powerful angel announced that when the seventh angel blew his trumpet, God would finish his plan. Then God told John to eat the scroll that the angel held. He also told John that he would show him more future events.

#### 10:9a

**And I went to the angel and said, “Give me the small scroll.”**

* Then I went to the angel and asked/told him to give the little scroll to me.
* So I went to the angel and said, “Please give me the little scroll.”

#### 10:9b

**“Take it and eat it,” he said.**

* He said to me, “Take and eat it.

#### 10:9a–b

**And:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *And* is literally “and.” It usually indicates a continuation of the story. This is why the BSB translates it as *And*. But since the voice from heaven commanded John to go and take the scroll, many English versions translate the Greek word as “so.” Consider how to connect the event here with the command of 10:8\.

**said:** The Greek word is literally “told” (as in the RSV). But John spoke politely to the angel. He did not rudely demand the scroll. He did not command the angel as if he had greater authority than the angel. So some English versions translate the Greek word as “asked.” This indicates a polite request. Other English versions, such as the BSB, translate this word as “said.” Consider how you want to translate this word.

#### 10:9c

**“It will make your stomach bitter,**

* It will make your stomach hurt/ache,
* It will be unpleasant/bitter to your stomach,

**It will make your stomach bitter:** This clause indicates that John’s stomach would hurt from the bitterness of the scroll. This bitterness implies that the message would be unpleasant in some way. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> it will be bitter to your stomach (RSV)

> it will turn your stomach sour (NIV)

#### 10:9d

**but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.”**

* but it will be sweet like honey in your mouth.”
* but it will taste as sweet as honey.”

**as sweet as honey:** The word *honey* refers to the sweet, sticky, thick liquid that bees make. It is very pleasant to eat.

In some languages people are not familiar with *honey*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

##### **General Comment on 10:9c–d**

* Use a word that refers to a similar sweet substance that tastes good. For example:

    > as sweet as syrup

* Translate the meaning without the simile. For example:

    > very sweet

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. For example:

    > Honey is the sweet, sticky, thick liquid that bees make. People eat honey as food.

Putting the scroll in the mouth happens first, and then the stomach becomes sour. In some languages it is more natural to put 10:9d before 10:9c. For example:

> 9dIn your mouth it will be as sweet as honey, 9cbut it will turn your stomach sour.

**they told me:** There is a textual issue in 10:11a: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the clause they said to me (BSB, NRSV, NASB, GW, CEV, NET). (2\) Some later Greek manuscripts have the clause he said to me (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. The Greek clause is literally “they said to me.” It is not clear who the pronoun *they* refers to. It probably refers generally to angels who told John God’s message. For example:

> they said to me (NRSV)

> some voices said (CEV)

> Others told me

Some English versions translate this clause as a passive because it is not clear to whom the pronoun “they” refers.

**You must prophesy:** The Greek clause is literally “It is necessary for you to prophesy.” God required John to write more prophecies for him.

**prophesy:** The word *prophesy* refers to speaking to people a message that God gives to him. These messages are called “prophecies” and reveal things that God wants people to know at that time. Other ways to translate this word are:

> speak God’s message

> proclaim God’s revelation

#### 10:11b

**about many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.”**

* about many peoples, countries, languages, and kings.”
* about many peoples/lands, nations, languages, and national leaders.”

**about:** There are several ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as *about*. The main interpretations are:

1. It means concerning. The word refers to talking about the many peoples and nations. For example:

    > about (RSV) *(BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NASB, NABRE, NLT, CEV, NET, REB, ESV, NCV)*

2. It means against. The prophecy is about the bad things that the many peoples and nations are doing. For example:

    > against (NJB) *(NJB)*

3. It means before. The prophecy is for the many peoples and nations to hear. For example:

    > in front of (GW) *(KJV, GW)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).Swete (page 132\) says, “The Seer is not sent to prophesy in their presence…, nor against them.” Osbourne (page 404\) translates the Greek word as “about.”

**peoples and nations:** See how you translated these words in 5:9 or 7:9\.

**kings:** This word refers to the highest ruler of a country. He usually has authority to make all decisions concerning the country. In some languages people are not familiar with *kings*. If that is true in your language, you may want to use a word or phrase that means leaders of countries. For example:

> leaders of nations

## Revelation 11:1 (id: 522975)

### Section 11:1–14: The two witnesses

In this section, John saw a new part of this vision. He saw the temple in Jerusalem. Ungodly people controlled the outermost courtyard of the temple.

Then he saw two men who testified about God and Jesus. They were killed, but God caused them to live again and took them to heaven. At that time God caused an earthquake in which seven thousand people died. The rest of the people in Jerusalem then honored God.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> God’s two witnesses

> Two men told/testified about God and Jesus in Jerusalem

#### 11:1a

**Then I was given a measuring rod like a staff and was told,**

* ¶ A reed/cane like a measuring rod was given to me, and I was told,
* ¶ The Lamb gave me a reed/bamboo stem/stick which looked like a stick for measuring distances. He told me,

**I was given a measuring rod like a staff:** The clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. Probably Jesus gave the rod, because in 11:3a the speaker said that he will give power to his witnesses. For example:

> The Lamb gave a reed like a measuring rod to me

> I received a reed like a measuring rodIn some languages “take” and “receive” is translated by the same verb. The English verb “receive” implies that someone gave the rod, but the English verb “take” does not imply that. Your translation should imply or indicate that someone gave it.

**a measuring rod:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *a measuring rod* refers to the straight stick or stem of the reed plant. It is a long, straight stemmed plant that often grows by water.

In some languages people are not familiar with reeds. If that is true in your language, you may want to use the name of a straight, thin stemmed plant that is not easily broken. This could be bamboo or some other long straight plant or stick, or a straight tree branch. For example:

> a long cane (NJB)

**a staff:** This refers to a straight stick that is used for measuring distances. It may have been similar to the “measuring rod” in Ezekiel 40:5\. That rod was about 3\.2 meters (10\.5 feet) long.

**was told:** There is a textual issue in 11:1a: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the word saying (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some later Greek manuscripts have the words the angel stood saying (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT recommends it. The clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. Probably Jesus spoke to him here. For example:

> he told me

#### 11:1b

**“Go and measure the temple of God and the altar,**

* “Go/Rise and measure God’s temple and the altar,
* “Go and use the reed/bamboo to learn/count the size of God’s temple and the place/platform for offerings.

**Go:** The Greek word is literally “Rise” (as in the RSV). It indicates that Jesus summoned John to do something. In some languages a literal translation indicates that meaning. For example:

> Rise (RSV)

But the context does not indicate that John was sitting and needed to stand up. In some languages a different word must be used to indicate the correct meaning. For example:

> Come (NRSV)

> Listen

The context implies that in the vision John would go from place to place in order to measure things. So many English versions translate the Greek word as *Go*.

**measure:** People *measure* something to find out how big it is. At that time people measured the size of large things using a rod. A person moved the rod along the edge of an item consecutively from its beginning to its end. The number of times the rod is laid down consecutively is counted.

In some languages the word “count” is used here instead of *measure*. For example:

> count the distance/size

**temple:** The word *temple* refers to a building where God, or another deity, is believed to be present in a special way. People worship him there. Here the word refers to the building of worship in Jerusalem. See how you translated this word in 3:12 or 7:15\.

**altar:** On earth, an *altar* is a platform on which people offer sacrifices or gifts to God. This *altar* is in front of the earthly temple. A fire burned inside this *altar*. See how you translated this word in 6:9\.

#### 11:1c

**and count the number of worshipers there.**

* and count those worshiping there.
* Also, count the number of people who are worshiping God there.

**and count the number of worshipers there:** The Greek words are literally “and the ones worshiping there.” The word “measure” from 11:1b is implied here. Here it indicates the meaning of *count*.

**worshipers:** This word refers to people who had come to the temple to honor God.

* **Associated Passages:** REV 11:1

## Revelation 11:2 (id: 522978)

### Section 11:1–14: The two witnesses

Then he saw two men who testified about God and Jesus. They were killed, but God caused them to live again and took them to heaven. At that time God caused an earthquake in which seven thousand people died. The rest of the people in Jerusalem then honored God.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

#### 11:2a

**But exclude the courtyard outside the temple. Do not measure it,**

* But do not measure the outer courtyard of the temple; leave that out,
* But do not include the outermost courtyard when you measure,

**exclude the courtyard outside the temple. Do not measure it:** These two clauses have the same meaning. In some languages it is more natural to reverse their order or combine them into one clause. For example:

> do not measure the outermost courtyard of temple; ignore it

> do not measure the outer courtyard (NLT)

**exclude the courtyard outside the temple:** This clause indicates that the outer court was not to be included in measuring the temple area. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> Leave out the court which is outside the temple (NASB)

> leave that out (ESV)

By excluding the *courtyard outside the temple*, John would measure only the distance around the inner courts. Within these courts was the temple.

In some languages it is more natural to explain what was measured. For example:

> exclude the outer court and measure only the wall around the inner courts and the temple

**courtyard outside the temple:** The temple in Jerusalem was surrounded by several courtyards. The phrase *courtyard outside the temple* refers to the area inside the outermost wall. But it does not include the courtyard of women, the courtyard of men and the courtyard of the priests.

The *courtyard outside the temple* was set aside for people who were not Jews. They could worship God there. They were not allowed into any of the other courts. John was told to measure the size of the temple and the inner courtyards that surrounded the temple. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the outer courtyard of the temple (NET)

> the outermost court/area of the temple

#### 11:2b

**because it has been given over to the nations,**

* because it has been given to the nations/foreigners.
* because God has given control of it to pagans.

**it has been given over to the nations:** This clause indicates that God allowed the non\-Jews, often referred to as “the Gentiles,” to occupy or control this courtyard. The clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> God has given it to the Gentiles

**it:** This pronoun refers to the outer court.

**the nations:** Here the word *nations* refers to people who are not Jews. Here the word refers to people who are not the people of God. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the Gentiles (NIV)

> foreigners

> the heathen (GNT)

> those people who don’t know God (CEV)

#### 11:2c

**and they will trample the holy city for 42 months.**

* They will trample/stomp on the holy city for forty\-two months.
* For 42 months they will oppress the people of the city that has been set apart for God.

**they will trample:** The word *trample* means to walk over something and stomp on it so as to destroy it. Here it refers figuratively to oppressing people.

In some languages a literal translation would not imply the figurative meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:

    > They will oppress *You may then want to explain the Greek word in a footnote. For example:*

    > Literally: “trample.”

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. For example:

    > The word “trample” refers figuratively to oppressing the people in the holy city.

**the holy city:** The scholars have various opinions about what this phrase refers to. Translate this phrase literally.

**holy:** Here this word refers to the city as being dedicated for God’s use. Other ways to translate *holy* are:

> set apart

> special in God’s eyes

### Section 11:1–14: The two witnesses

In this section, John saw a new part of this vision. He saw the temple in Jerusalem. Ungodly people controlled the outermost courtyard of the temple.

Then he saw two men who testified about God and Jesus. They were killed, but God caused them to live again and took them to heaven. At that time God caused an earthquake in which seven thousand people died. The rest of the people in Jerusalem then honored God.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> God’s two witnesses

> Two men told/testified about God and Jesus in Jerusalem

#### 11:3a

**And I will empower my two witnesses,**

* But/And I will enable my two witnesses,
* I will give authority to two people who testify/witness about me.

**And:** The Greek conjunction here probably introduces more information. Some English versions translate the Greek conjunction as “and.” Other English versions do not translate the conjunction and allow the context to imply this connection.

There is some contrast here with the ungodly people trampling the holy city. In some languages it is more natural to indicate this contrast. For example:

> But (NJB)

**I will empower:** The Greek word the BSB translates as *I will empower* is literally “I will give.” BSB supplies the word *empower* because the context implies either “power” or “authority” will be given. What the witnesses will be able to do is told in 11:3b. For example:

> grant authority (ESV)

**witnesses:** The noun “witness” refers to a person who tells what he has seen, heard, or come to know. Here the *witnesses* tell others what God told them. The Greek word may refer to two men or to a man and a woman. It probably does not refer to two women. Other ways to translate this word are:

> testifiers

> people who speaks about what they knows

> those who report/explain

See how you translated this word in 1:5 or 3:14\.

#### 11:3b

**and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth.”**

* and they will prophesy for one thousand, two hundred and sixty days. They will be clothed in sackcloth to show their sadness/grief/sorrow during that time.”
* They will wear clothes for mourning and proclaim God’s messages/revelation for 1,260 days.”

**prophesy:** The word *prophesy* refers to speaking to people a message that God gives to him. These messages are called “prophecies” and reveal things that God wants people to know at that time. Other ways to translate this word are:

> speak God’s message

> proclaim God’s revelation

See how you translated this word in 10:11\.

**1,260:** The Greek phrase uses number words: “one\-thousand two\-hundred sixty.” There are several ways to translate this meaning:

* Use number words. For example:

    > one thousand two hundred sixty

    > one thousand and/plus two hundred and/plus sixty

* Use numerals as the BSB does.

Use number words or phrase for “thousand” and “hundred” from the major language. For example:

> one tausen two handet six tens

> one tausen and two handets and six tens

**clothed in sackcloth:** The word *sackcloth* refers to a rough cloth. The threads of the cloth are thick and made of hair. People often wore clothing made of *sackcloth* when they mourned someone who died.

In some languages people are not familiar with *sackcloth*. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain it in your translation. For example:

> wearing mourning clothes

> they will be dressed in rough cloth to show their sadness (NCV)

> dressed in clothing of rough cloth as a sign of grief

See how you translated this word at 6:12\.

#### 11:4–10

There are two ways to interpret who spoke these verses:

1. They are not part of the quotation that began in 11:1\. The speaker stopped speaking to John at the end of 11:3\. For example:

    > 3And I will grant my two witnesses power to prophesy for one thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.”

    > 4These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands which stand before the Lord of the earth.… (RSV) *(BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NASB, NABRE, NLT, GW, CEV, REB, NCV, ESV)*

2. They are part of the quotation. The speaker continues speaking until the end of 11:10\. For example:

    > 3But I shall send my two witnesses to prophesy for twelve hundred and sixty days, wearing sackcloth. 4These are the two olive trees and the two lamps in attendance on the Lord of the world.…10and the people of the world are glad about it and celebrate the event by giving presents to each other, because these two prophets have been a plague to the people of the world.’ (NJB) *(NJB, NET)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).Aune (page 577\), Osbourne (page 419\), Kistemaker (page 321\), and Smalley (page 276\) support interpretation (1\).

#### 11:4a–b

**These witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth:** This clause describes the two witnesses using the symbols of two olive trees and two lampstands. It refers back to the prophecy in Zechariah 4:1–14\.

In some languages a literal translation would not have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Translate this as a simile. For example:

    > These two witnesses are like two olive trees and two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth

* Explain that the saying is symbolic. For example:

    > These two witnesses are symbolically the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. For example:

    > This sentence has olive trees and lampstands, like Zechariah 4:1–14 does.

* Explain the reference in your translation. For example:

    > These two witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth, as is written in scripture

#### 11:4a

**These witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands**

* ¶ These witnesses are like two olive trees and two lamps on their stands
* ¶ These two people are symbolically the two olive trees and the two lampstands

**olive trees:** Olive trees have small round fruit. People squeeze the fruit and collect the oil. This oil is used in cooking and as fuel for lamps.

**the two lampstands:** A lampstand is a 1–2 meter (3–6 feet) tall stand. It has a place for a lamp on top. Here it is implied that lamps are on the lampstands. There were many kinds and styles of lampstand. The kind and style of lampstand is not important here.

A lamp in Jesus’ time was a small clay or metal container that people put oil in. The lamp was shaped to hold a wick on one side. The exact kind of lamp is not important here. So you should use a word that refers generally to this kind of lamp or light producing device.

See how you translated the word *lampstands* in 1:12 or 2:5\.

#### 11:4b

**that stand before the Lord of the earth.**

* that are/remain before the Lord over the earth.
* that stay in the presence of the Lord who rules the earth.

**that stand before the Lord of the earth:** This phrase refers to both the olive trees and the lampstands.

**stand:** Here the word *stand* indicates that the trees and lampstands are in the presence of the Lord of the earth.

**the Lord of the earth:** There is a textual issue in 11:4b: (1\) The earliest Greek manuscripts have the phrase the Lord of the earth (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some later Greek manuscripts have the phrase the God of the earth (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. This phrase indicates that the Lord God rules over all that happens in the world. For example:

> the Lord who rules the earth (CEV)

Then he saw two men who testified about God and Jesus. They were killed, but God caused them to live again and took them to heaven. At that time God caused an earthquake in which seven thousand people died. The rest of the people in Jerusalem then honored God.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> God’s two witnesses

> Two men told/testified about God and Jesus in Jerusalem

#### 11:5–6

The Greek and the BSB use present tense in these verses. It indicates that the events here occur throughout the 1,260 days (11:3b). Use the proper tense and grammar to indicate that the events here occur throughout the 1,260 days.

#### 11:5a

**If anyone wants to harm them,**

* If anyone tries to hurt them,
* If any enemy tries to harm them,

#### 11:5a–b

**If anyone wants to harm them, fire proceeds from their mouths and devours their enemies:** The word *anyone* is singular, but refers generally to *their enemies*. The singular word indicates that whoever the enemy is, he will be destroyed. Other ways to translate these words are:

> Fire comes from their mouths and consumes their enemies if anyone tries to harm them (NJB)

> Any enemy who tries to harm them will be destroyed by the fire that comes out of their mouths (CEV)

#### 11:5b

**fire proceeds from their mouths and devours their enemies.**

* fire comes from their mouths and consumes their enemies.
* fire bursts out of the mouths of the two witnesses and burns their foes to ashes.

**fire proceeds from their mouths:** This indicates that flames of *fire* leave the mouths of the witnesses. It is implied that the flames leave their mouths forcefully.

**devours:** This word refers to eating something. But it also refers to the way fire burns something until only ashes are left. Use a word that refers to when fire burns something completely. The word probably implies “immediately” or “quickly” here. Other ways to translate this word are:

> consumes (RSV)

> completely burns

#### 11:5c

**In this way, anyone who wants to harm them must be killed.**

* Indeed, anyone who tries to hurt them will certainly be killed that way.
* Every enemy of theirs will certainly die in that way if they try to harm them.

**In this way, anyone who wants to harm them must be killed:** The Greek words are literally “If anyone tries to harm them, it is necessary for him to be killed in that way.” The words indicate that any enemy attacking the two witnesses will certainly die. They will die from the fire coming from the mouths of the two witnesses. Other ways to translate this are:

> anyone who tries to harm them will certainly be killed in this way (NJB)

> so shall anyone die who tries to do them injury (REB)

**These witnesses have power to shut the sky**

* These two have authority to prevent the sky
* These witnesses(dual) have the ability to stop any rain

#### 11:6a–b

**These witnesses have power to shut the sky so that no rain will fall:** This clause indicates that the two witnesses are able to prevent rain from falling. God gave them the authority to do this. It is implied that they actually do *shut the sky*. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> They have authority to shut up the sky so that there will be no rain (GNT)

> These witnesses have authority to shut the sky in order to keep rain from falling (GW)

> These men are able to shut the sky so it does not rain and they do so

**These witnesses:** The Greek word is literally “These.” The ending on the Greek word may imply two men or a man and a woman. Other ways to translate this Greek word are:

> These two (REB)

> They (CEV)

**power to shut the sky so that no rain will fall:** The word *shut* symbolically indicates that the witnesses are able to prevent rain from falling.

In some languages the meaning of this figure of speech is not clear or natural. If that is true in your language, translate its meaning. For example:

> the power to stop the sky from raining (NCV)

> able to prevent any rain from falling

#### 11:6b

**so that no rain will fall during the days of their prophecy,**

* from raining during the time they are prophesying,
* from falling during the days that they are proclaiming God’s messages/revelation to people.

**during the days of their prophecy:** This phrase refers to the 1,260 days in 11:3b. It may imply that the witnesses would prevent rain over the whole earth during that whole time. Or it may imply that they would prevent rain over different parts of the earth for shorter times. You should translate this phrase so that it allows either interpretation. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> during the days of their prophesying (RSV)

> while they are prophesying (CEV)

**the days of their prophecy:** This phrase refers to the 1,260 days when God gives the witnesses messages to tell the people. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the time they speak what God has revealed (GW)

> the time when they were telling people what God has revealed to them

#### 11:6c

**and power to turn the waters into blood**

* and they have authority to change any body of water into blood
* They also have the ability to change any river, spring, lake, or sea into blood.

**and power to turn the waters into blood:** It is again implied that the witnesses actually do what they have the power or ability to do. For example:

> they are able to change the waters into blood and they do so

**the waters:** The word *waters* refers generally to springs, rivers, lakes, oceans, and underground water. Use a word or phrase that can refer generally to various bodies of water. For example:

> various bodies of water

> all kinds/sorts of bodies of water

Some languages cannot refer generally to various bodies of water. If that is true in your language, list several different bodies of water. For example:

> the rivers and oceans (NLT)

> the oceans, rivers, and lakes

#### 11:6d

**and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they wish.**

* and to afflict the earth with every kind of plague whenever they want.
* And they have the ability to cause all kinds of disasters on people all over the earth as often as they desire to do so.

**strike the earth with every kind of plague:** This clause refers to causing plagues that hurt people. People everywhere will be affected. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> afflict the earth with every kind of plague (REB)

> cause all kinds of plagues on people over the whole earth

**plague:** This word refers to disasters that harm a lot of people. It can refer to diseases that kill many people. It can refer to locusts that damage many crops. Some languages do not have a general word such as *plague*. If that is true in your language, you may need to use a descriptive phrase. For example:

> calamities/disasters that cause much death

> things that cause people to suffer

### Section 11:1–14: The two witnesses

In this section, John saw a new part of this vision. He saw the temple in Jerusalem. Ungodly people controlled the outermost courtyard of the temple.

Then he saw two men who testified about God and Jesus. They were killed, but God caused them to live again and took them to heaven. At that time God caused an earthquake in which seven thousand people died. The rest of the people in Jerusalem then honored God.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

#### 11:7a

**When the two witnesses have finished their testimony,**

* ¶ When they finish proclaiming their message, (GNT)
* ¶ When the two witnesses have finished telling their message, (NCV)

**(NIV:) Now:** In the NIV, the word *Now* introduces the next event, but it does not refer to our present time. The BSB and some other English translations omit this word. For example:

> When (BSB, GNT)

**testimony:** The word *testimony* means “the words spoken about what one saw or heard.” The word *testimony* is often used when the person speaking is expected to be truthful and accurate (as in a court of law). Other ways to translate this word are:

> witnessing (NJB)

> message that God told them to say

Some languages translate this word using a verb. For example:

> the truth/message revealed to them

> proclaiming God’s message

See how you translated this word in 6:9\. But, in particular, it refers to the words that God had given them to say, which John called prophesying in 11:3, 6\. Your translation should at least imply that.

#### 11:7b

**the beast that comes up from the Abyss will wage war with them,**

* the demon named Beast that comes up from the bottomless pit will attack them,
* the monster that comes up from the very/immeasurably deep hole that is the home of demons and the dead will attack them.

**beast:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *beast* refers to any animal, often a wild animal. The BSB uses the word *beast* to imply that this being is fierce, dangerous, or evil. Here the word refers to Satan or one of his servants, because they are fierce, dangerous, and evil.

In some languages a literal translation would not clearly indicate the symbolic meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a word that clearly refers to an evil creature or being. For example:

    > monster

* Explain the symbol in a footnote. For example:

    > The word “beast” refers to the devil or one of his servants. They are fierce, dangerous, and evil like wild beasts.

* Use the general word “animal” and explain that it is fierce, dangerous, or evil. For example:

    > fierce/terrible animal

**Abyss:** The word *Abyss* refers to a very deep pit or chasm. The Greek word also refers to an underground place where the spirits of dead people and demons lived. It likely has that meaning here. Other ways to translate this word are:

> bottomless pit (RSV)

> hole deep beyond measure

> cave/cavern leading to the place of the dead

See how you translated this word in 9:1\.

#### 11:7c

**and will overpower and kill them.**

* conquer/overwhelm them, and kill them.
* He will gain control/victory over them and kill them.

**overpower:** This word indicates that the beast was successful in his attack against the two witnesses. For example:

> defeat (GNT)

## Revelation 11:8 (id: 522989)

### Section 11:1–14: The two witnesses

In this section, John saw a new part of this vision. He saw the temple in Jerusalem. Ungodly people controlled the outermost courtyard of the temple.

Then he saw two men who testified about God and Jesus. They were killed, but God caused them to live again and took them to heaven. At that time God caused an earthquake in which seven thousand people died. The rest of the people in Jerusalem then honored God.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> God’s two witnesses

> Two men told/testified about God and Jesus in Jerusalem

#### 11:8a

**Their bodies will lie in the street of the great city—**

* Their corpses(dual) will lie in the street of the great city,
* Their dead bodies will lie in the main street of the well\-known city.

**Their bodies:** The Greek phrase is literally “their body,” but it refers to both bodies.

**street:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *street* refers to an important or broad street. For example:

> main street (NLT)

**the great city:** This phrase refers to Jerusalem, or possibly Rome or all places where the people oppose God. John purposely did not name the city here.

**great:** The word *great* indicates that the city is an important or well\-known city. For example:

> important (GW)

#### 11:8b

**figuratively called Sodom and Egypt—**

* which is symbolically Sodom and Egypt,
* That city is spiritually/prophetically called Sodom and Egypt.

**figuratively called Sodom and Egypt:** The people of Sodom sinned greatly (Genesis 13:13\). The people of Egypt oppressed God’s people (Exodus 3:7,9\). God punished them for those sins. Perhaps at this time, the people of Jerusalem will be sinning greatly too. But John does not explain why the great city is called *Sodom and Egypt*. So you should not explain it in your translation either.

This clause tells the reader more about the great city. Translate this clause so that it tells more about the great city. Some languages must avoid using the word “which” to do so. For example:

> It is figuratively called Sodom and Egypt.

**figuratively called:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *figuratively* means “spiritually.” It indicates that the great city is like Sodom and Egypt, perhaps in their bad thinking toward God. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> that is prophetically called (NRSV)

> which mystically is called (NASB)

> known by the symbolic names (NJB)

#### 11:8c

**where their Lord was also crucified.**

* where their(dual) Lord was crucified.
* Long ago people killed the Lord of the two witnesses on a cross in that city.

**where their Lord was also crucified:** There is a textual issue in 11:8c: (1\) The earliest Greek manuscripts have the pronoun their (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) One early Greek manuscript have the pronoun our (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. This phrase tells the reader more about the “great city.” Translate it so that it tells more about the great city. Some languages must avoid using the word *where* to do so. For example:

> Their Lord was crucified there.

John’s readers knew that Jesus was crucified at Jerusalem. But the “great city” might be symbolic of all people who are enemies of God. You may want to explain this in a footnote:

> Jesus was crucified at Jerusalem. But the “great city” may be symbolic of all people who are enemies of God.

**their Lord was also crucified:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. The particular people who crucified Jesus is not important here. For example:

> people crucified the Lord of those two witnesses

**their:** The pronoun *their* refers to the two witnesses, and not to the people of the great city.

**Lord:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Lord* means “the one who has authority over (something),” or “owner.” Jesus is ruler over the two witnesses, so they always did what he told them.

**crucified:** The word *crucified* refers to a method of executing someone. Soldiers nailed the prisoner to a wooden cross through the wrists and feet. Then they raised the cross and stood it up in a hole in the ground. The person hung from the cross in great pain until he died. Other ways to translate this word are:

> nailed to a cross

> put on a cross to die

If you have translated one or more of the Gospels, see how you translated this word in Matthew 20:19, Mark 15:13, Luke 23:21, or John 19:6\.

##### **General Comment on 11:8b–c**

The “great city” is described in two ways in 11:8b–c. It is given two symbolic names. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that Jesus was crucified in Sodom and Egypt. If that is true in your language, you may want to reorder the phrases. For example:

> where their Lord was crucified, which is also figuratively called Sodom and Egypt.

> where the Lord was killed. This city is named Sodom and Egypt, which has a spiritual meaning. (NCV)

> where their Lord was crucified. The spiritual names of that city are Sodom and Egypt. (GW)

Other examples of headings for this section are:

#### 11:9a–10b

The Greek uses the present tense for the verbs “view,” “permit,” “gloat,” and “celebrate.” The Greek grammar indicates that people will do those things throughout the three and a half days. Many English versions use the future tense. They use the phrase “For three and a half days” to indicate the continuous action.

#### 11:9a

**For three and a half days all peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will view their bodies**

* For three and a half days people from every people/land, tribe/clan, language, and nation will look at their bodies
* People from every people\-group, tribe, language, and country will stare at their dead bodies for three days and half/part of the fourth day.

**three and a half days:** Some languages do not usually refer to *half* a day. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain it in your translation. For example:

> three whole days and part of another day

> three whole days and the next day until noon

**all peoples and tribes and tongues and nations:** The word *all* applies to each of the four kinds of groups. For example:

> from every tribe, every language, every people, and every nation

See how you translated this phrase in 5:9 or 7:9\. But note that the order of the groups is different here.

**peoples:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *peoples* here refers to a large group of people. But it is sometimes used to refer to a whole country, which may have many people groups in it.

See how you translated this word in 5:9 or 7:9\.

**tribes:** This word can refer to a whole people group like “tribe” or to subgroups within the people group like “clan.”

See how you translated this word in 5:9 or 7:9\.

**tongues:** This word refers to all the people that speak one language as a group.

**nations:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *nations* here refers to groups of people who share a common culture. But it is sometimes used to refer to whole countries, which may have many people groups in them. It is similar in meaning to “peoples” above, but probably it here refers to groups of people each under one government.

See how you translated this word in 5:9 or 7:9\.

**will view their bodies:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *view* is the normal word for “look at (something).” The people looked at the bodies because they were happy that the two witnesses were now dead. The word or phrase that you use should not imply that the people were sad that the two witnesses were dead. For example:

> will stare at their corpses (NJB)

#### 11:9b

**and will not permit them to be laid in a tomb.**

* and not allow anyone to bury them.
* They will insist that no one bury them.

**will not permit them to be laid in a tomb:** The people will be very upset because the two witnesses caused much suffering. So they will not let anyone bury the two witnesses. Preventing anyone to bury them shows that the people reject them. The people do not honor them in any way. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> they will refuse to bury them (NCV)

> will not allow them to be buried (GNT)

#### 11:10a–c

The events in this verse occur during the three and a half days (11:11a). Some languages are able to indicate that in the grammar of the sentence. For example:

> The inhabitants of the earth will be gloating over them…

Or you may want to indicate when these events occur with a time phrase at the beginning of 11:10\. For example:

> During that time the inhabitants of the earth…

> During those days the inhabitants of the earth…

#### 11:10a

**And those who dwell on the earth will gloat over them,**

* Those who live on the earth will rejoice over them
* The people living at that time will be happy about the death of the two witnesses.

**And those who dwell on the earth:** This phrase refers to the people who live on the earth. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> The inhabitants of the earth (NIV)

> the people of the world (NJB)

**will gloat over them:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *gloat* means “rejoice” (as in the RSV). The people will be happy that the two witnesses are dead.

#### 11:10b

**and will celebrate and send one another gifts,**

* and will celebrate and send gifts to each other,
* They will celebrate their deaths and send presents to one another,

**will celebrate and send one another gifts:** The Greek words are literally “celebrate and will send gifts to each other.” The people will rejoice in various ways and also give gifts to each other. Other ways to translate the Greek words are:

> make merry and exchange presents (ESV)

> They will celebrate and send presents to each other (GNT)

#### 11:10c

**because these two prophets had tormented them.**

* because these two prophets had caused those who live on the earth to suffer much.

**these two prophets:** This phrase refers to the two witnesses. They were prophets as well as witnesses to Jesus.

**prophets:** A *prophet* is a person to whom God gives a message. The message (often called a “prophecy”) may include a vision, as in Ezekiel 1 and Daniel 8\. The message, called a prophecy, may reveal something about past events, current events, or future events.. The prophet tells God’s message to the people or writes it down for their use. See how you translated this word in 10:7\.

**tormented:** This word means “cause someone to suffer.” Other ways to translate this word are:

> brought much suffering (NCV)

> caused pain

* ¶ But God breathed life into them after those three and a half days finished,

#### 11:11b

**and they stood on their feet,**

* and they rose to their feet,
* and they stood up, alive.

#### 11:11a–b

**after the three and a half days:** There is a textual issue in 11:11a: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the phrase after the three and a half days (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the phrase after three and a half days (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. This phrase refers to the same three and half days in 11:9a. This phrase refers to the same time period of *three and a half days* mentioned in 11:9a.

**the breath of life from God entered the two witnesses:** This clause indicates that God caused them to live again. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> a life\-giving breath came from God and entered them (GNT)

> God breathed life into them (NJB)

> a breath of life from God entered them and they became alive again

#### 11:11c

**and great fear fell upon those who saw them.**

* and great fear fell on those who saw them. (RSV)
* Everybody who saw it happen was terrified. (NJB)

**great fear fell upon those who saw them:** The Greek clause is literally “great fear fell upon the ones seeing them.” This clause indicates that the people watched the two witnesses become alive. The people became very afraid. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> everyone who saw them became very afraid (NCV)

> tremendous fear seized those who were watching them (NET)

#### 11:12b

**“Come up here.”**

* “Ascend here.”
* “You two, come up here.”

#### 11:12a–b

**a loud voice from heaven:** John does not say who spoke here. Use a phrase that can refer to anyone in heaven. For example:

> someone say loudly from heaven

#### 11:12c

**And they went up to heaven in a cloud as their enemies watched them.**

* And they ascended to heaven in a cloud while their enemies were watching.

**And in that hour there was a great earthquake,**

* ¶ Just then a great/big earthquake occurred/shook
* ¶ Immediately the earth/ground shook strongly,

**And in that hour:** The earthquake probably occurred immediately after the two witnesses ascended to heaven. For example:

> Just then (NET)

**there was a great earthquake:** The Greek clause is literally “a great earthquake occurred.” In some languages it is more natural to follow the literal Greek. For example:

> a great/big earthquake came/shook

#### 11:13b

**and a tenth of the city collapsed.**

* and a tenth part of the city collapsed/fell.
* so that one of every ten buildings in the city broke and fell.
* destroying one part in ten of the city.

**and a tenth of the city collapsed:** The context implies that the earthquake caused *a tenth of the city* to collapse. For example:

> 13athere was a terrible earthquake 13bthat destroyed a tenth of the city (CEV)

**and:** The GNT omits this conjunction and uses the semi\-colon (;) to imply that the earthquake caused a tenth of the city to collapse:

> 13athere was a violent earthquake; 13ba tenth of the city was destroyed

**a tenth of the city collapsed:** This clause indicates that one of every ten buildings broke and fell. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> one part in ten parts of the city collapsed

> one of every ten buildings in the city collapsed

> one part of the city collapsed and nine parts not

#### 11:13c

**Seven thousand were killed in the quake,**

* Seven thousand people were killed because of the earthquake,

> Seven thousand people died because of the earthquake

#### 11:13d

**and the rest were terrified**

* and the rest of the people were fearful
* The others in the city who lived through the earthquake were afraid

**the rest:** This phrase refers to the people in the city who did not die because of the earthquake. For example:

#### 11:14b

**Behold, the third woe is coming shortly.**

* but, look/hey, the third great trouble is indeed coming soon.
* Listen/Wow, the third/last great difficulty will come quickly.

**Behold:** 11:14b begins with the Greek word that means “look.” The word emphasizes or calls attention to the words that follow. The word is not a command to look at something. The BSB translates this word as *Behold*. The NIV does not explicitly translate this word. The GNT uses an exclamation point to show the emphasis. Other ways to translate this word are:

**“The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ,**

* “The power to rule the world now belongs to our(incl) Lord and his Christ,
* “Authority over the world has now passed to our Lord God and to his Christ.

**The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ:** This clause indicates that God and Jesus will now rule over all things in the world. Satan will no longer rule people. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> Sovereignty over the world has passed to our Lord and his Christ (REB)

> The power to rule the world now belongs to our Lord and his Christ (NCV)

> Our Lord and his Christ have begun to rule/reign over the world

**kingdom:** Here the word *kingdom* refers to having the power to rule as king. The Lord now rules as king over the world. Other ways to translate this word are:

> dominion

> royal authority

**the world:** This phrase refers to the whole world and all who live in it.

**our Lord:** The word *Lord* refers to God here. The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Lord* means “the one who has authority over (others),” or “owner.”

In some languages it is more natural to include “God” in this phrase. For example:

> our Lord God

**His Christ:** The pronoun *His* refers to God. God chose Jesus to be the Christ, the anointed one.

**Christ:** The word *Christ* is a title for Jesus. It means “the anointed one.” See how you translated this word in 1:1 or 1:5\.

#### 11:15d

**and He will reign forever and ever.”**

* and he will rule for ever and ever.”
* He will rule for eternity/always.”

**And the twenty\-four elders who sit on their thrones before God**

* ¶ And the twenty\-four elders, who were sitting on their thrones before God,
* ¶ The twenty\-four leaders were sitting on their places/seats of ruling before God,

**elders:** Here the word *elders* refers to those who have authority. These *elders* are the same ones as in 4:4\. These twenty\-four people (or angels) were leaders. They had God as their leader. For example:

> leaders (GW)

These verses do not say whether the elders were people or angels. So use a word like “elder” or “leader” that could refer to either people or angels. See how you translated this word in 4:4 or 7:11\.

**thrones:** A *throne* usually refers to the official chair of a king. Here the word *thrones* refers to special chairs for the elders. These thrones show that the elders have authority or a special place before God.

See how you translated this word in 1:4 or 4:4\.

#### 11:16b

**fell on their faces and worshiped God,**

* prostrated themselves before God and worshiped/honored him
* but at this time they knelt and put their faces to the ground before God and revered him.

**fell on their faces:** Here this phrase refers to kneeling and putting faces to the ground with arms outstretched toward God. This position showed complete humility before God and honored him. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> prostrated themselves and touched the ground with their foreheads (NJB)

> threw themselves down with their faces to the ground (NET)

Many languages have a different way to show complete humility and honor to God. If that is true in your language, you may want to use that saying instead. See how you translated this phrase in 7:11, where the BSB translates it as “fell facedown.”

**worshiped:** This word refers to honoring someone or something as sacred/divine. Other ways to translate this word are:

> venerated

* with these words: “Lord God Almighty, the one who is and was, we(excl) thank you,
* Revering him they said, “Lord God, the all\-powerful one who exists now, and who has always existed! We thank you

**saying:** What the elders said was part of their worship (11:16b). For example:

> with these words: (NET)

In some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. If that is true in your language, indicate that 11:17–18 is a part of the worship. For example:

> In worship they said

**We give thanks to You, O Lord God Almighty, the One who is and who was:** There is a textual issue in 11:17a: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the phrase the one who is and who was (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some later Greek manuscripts have the phrase the one who is and who was and who is to come (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT recommends it. Both the Greek and the BSB indicate first that the speakers begin to give thanks. The direct address and the descriptive phrase is in the middle of the spoken words.

In some languages it is more natural to have the direct address and the descriptive phrase first. For example:

> Lord God Almighty, the One who is and who was, we give thanks to you

**Almighty:** This word is a title which means, “the one with the power to do anything.” For example:

> the All\-Powerful (NET)

See how you translated this word in 1:8 or 4:8\.

**the One who is and who was:** The elders spoke these words as a title for God. It indicates that God is eternal. Other ways to translate these words are:

> the One who is and was

> him who exists and who always existed

#### 11:17b

**because You have taken Your great power and have begun to reign.**

* because you have taken your great power and have begun ruling as king.
* because you have used your great power and have begun to rule! (NCV)

**You have taken Your great power:** This clause indicates that God began to use his great power, probably in a new way. Those powers are described in the chapters of Revelation. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> you have used your great power (NCV)

> you have shown/exercised your great power

> you have acted/worked very powerfully

**have begun to reign:** God has always reigned, but this clause refers to reigning in a new way. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> have…entered upon your reign (REB)

> have begun ruling as king (GW)

In this section, the seventh angel blew his trumpet. Then voices in heaven announced that God and Jesus now rule over the whole world. The voices also announced that God would soon judge all people. He would reward believers but punish those destroying the earth. John also saw God’s temple in heaven opened and the ark of the covenant inside it.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The seventh angel and his trumpet

> The seventh trumpet sounded/blew

#### 11:18a–b

**The nations were enraged, and Your wrath has come:** There is some contrast between these two clauses. The people were angry, but God was also angry. God made their anger ineffective. In some languages it is more natural to indicate this contrast. For example:

> The nations were filled with wrath, but now the time of your wrath has come (NLT)

**were enraged…wrath:** The phrase *were enraged* and the word *wrath* both refer to strong anger. The people of the nations were very angry with God, and he became very angry with them. For example:

> The nations were filled with wrath, but now the time of your wrath has come (NLT)

#### 11:18a

**The nations were enraged,**

* The nations against you were angry,
* The people of the world were filled with anger,

**nations:** Here the word *nations* refers to people who do not believe in God. For example:

> people of the world (NCV)

#### 11:18b

**and Your wrath has come.**

* but the day of your anger has come,
* but now is the time when you act in anger against them.

**Your wrath has come:** This clause indicates that God has begun to act against the nations because of his anger. He will punish them. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> the time for your anger has come (GNT)

> you now act in anger against them

#### 11:18c

**The time has come to judge the dead**

* and the time has come to judge the dead,
* Now is the time when you will judge the people who have died,

**The time has come to judge the dead:** The Greek words are literally “and the time to judge the dead.” For example:

> and the time for the dead to be judged (RSV)

The BSB begins a new sentence at 11:18c and repeats the phrase *has come*. The BSB does that to make this verse easier to read. In some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here.

**The time has come:** This clause applies to all three phrases in 11:18 that begin with “to” (11:18c, 11:18d–f, 11:18g).

**time:** Here this word probably refers to a general time period rather than an exact time. But it is also possible that the elders are saying this just before God judges all people (20:11–15\). Use a word or phrase that allows for either interpretation.

**judge:** This word means “decide whether a person is guilty or not.”

**the dead:** This phrase refers to people who have died.

#### 11:18d–e

**Your servants the prophets, as well as the saints:** There are several ways to interpret the relationship between the phrase *Your servants* and the rest of these words. The main interpretations are:

1. The word *servants* refers only to the prophets. For example:

    > your servants, the prophets, and all your people, (GNT) *(BSB, GNT, NIV, NJB, NABRE, NLT, CEV, NET, REB, NCV, KJV)*

2. The word *servants* refers to all of the following groups. For example:

    > your servants, the prophets and saints, (ESV) *(RSV, NASB, ESV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).Aune (page 632\), Swete (page 143\), and Lenski (page 356\) support interpretation (1\).

#### 11:18d

**and to reward Your servants the prophets,**

* and the time has come to reward your servants, the prophets,
* and now is the time when you will reward those who serve you, namely your prophets,

**reward:** This word refers to doing good to someone because of the good deed he has done. Another way to translate this word is:

> give rewards

**Your servants the prophets:** This phrase indicates that the *prophets* were God’s *servants*. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the prophets who served you

> your servants, namely, the prophets

A similar phrase, “His servants the prophets,” occurs in 10:7\. See how you translated the phrase there.

#### 11:18e

**as well as the saints and those who fear Your name,**

* and also those who believe in you, namely all those who fear/honor your name,
* as well as all those you have made holy. They are the ones who respect and honor you,

**the saints and those who fear Your name:** There are two ways to interpret the relationship between the phrase *those who fear Your name* and the previous groups:

1. The phrase *those who fear Your name* describes all the previous groups. For example:

    > all your people, all who have reverence for you, (GNT) *(GNT, CEV, NCV)*

2. The phrase *those who fear Your name* refers to a group separate from all the previous groups. For example:

    > for the saints and for those who fear your name, (NJB) *(BSB, RSV, NIV, NJB, NASB, NABRE, NLT, GW, NET, REB, ESV, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). It is more likely that the phrase *those who fear Your name* describes all followers.Beale (page 616\), Lenski (pages 356–357\), Osbourne (pages 446–447\), and others support interpretation (1\). Aune (page 645\) and Swete (page 144\) say that the two groups are Jewish and Gentile Christians, based on similar phrases in Acts 13\. But Beale, Lenski, and Osbourne say that a connection to Acts 13 is inappropriate here.

**saints:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *saints* means “holy ones.” Here the word refers to all believers. For example:

> your people (GNT)

See how you translated this word in 5:8 or 8:3\.

**those who fear Your name:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *fear* is often translated “reverence.” Here the Greek word means “respect” or “revere.” People who fear God think about him humbly, with awe. They worship and obey him. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> all who respect you (NCV)

> people who honor your name (CEV)

> those who reverence your name (NIV)

#### 11:18f

**both small and great—**

* both humble and important,
* those of both low and high status.

**both small and great:** This phrase refers to believers of low status in society and believers of high status in society. It implies believers of all classes and position in society. The phrase does not refer to physical size.

In some languages it is more natural to have the high status first. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> both of high and lowly position/place

> whether they are important people or not

> both humble and great

#### 11:18g

**and to destroy those who destroy the earth.”**

* and the time has come to destroy/ruin the people who destroy/ruin the earth.”
* Now is also the time when you will destroy/ruin those who destroy/ruin the world/land.”

**those who destroy the earth:** This phrase refers to all people who harm the earth or any part of it.Some scholars (i.e. Aune, Beale, Kistemaker) think that “earth” refers to the people of the earth. But all English versions on TW and the NJB translate the Greek word only as “earth.” Johnson, Hughes, and Mounce think it only means “earth” here. God will destroy them because they destroyed his creation. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> those who ruin the earth

This phrase could also refer to Satan and demons. So your translation should allow for that possible meaning as well.

## Revelation 11:19 (id: 523010)

### Section 11:15–19: The angel blew the seventh trumpet

In this section, the seventh angel blew his trumpet. Then voices in heaven announced that God and Jesus now rule over the whole world. The voices also announced that God would soon judge all people. He would reward believers but punish those destroying the earth. John also saw God’s temple in heaven opened and the ark of the covenant inside it.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The seventh angel and his trumpet

> The seventh trumpet sounded/blew

#### 11:19a

**Then the temple of God in heaven was opened,**

* ¶ Then God’s temple in heaven opened,
* ¶ Then God caused his temple in heaven to open,

**the temple of God in heaven was opened:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active or intransitive clause. For example:

> God caused his temple in heaven to open

> God had someone open his temple in heaven

> God’s temple opened

#### 11:19b

**and the ark of His covenant appeared in His temple.**

* and the ark of his covenant was visible within his temple. (NET)
* and the box/chest that represents his agreement with his people could be seen inside it.

**the ark of His covenant:** Here the word *ark* refers to a wooden box that held things related to Israel’s *covenant* with God. The box was about 110 centimeters (45 inches) long, 70 centimeters (27 inches) wide and high. It was beautifully carved and covered with gold. Two gold statues of beings like angels stood upon the lid, which was also made of gold (Exodus 25:10–22\).

Below is an artist’s guess of what the ark looked like. The ark has not been seen since the Babylonians conquered Jerusalem 600 years before Jesus’ time.

Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the Covenant Box (GNT)

> the box/chest of his covenant

> the Ark that holds the agreement God gave to his people (NCV)

> the chest that symbolized/signified God’s covenant with his people

If you have translated Hebrews 9:4, see your translation there.

**covenant:** This word refers to a binding agreement made between two people or groups. It establishes a relationship of peace, cooperation, or friendship between them. They promise to be faithful to this agreement.

God made an agreement with Israel. He promised to be their God and they promised to obey him. For example:

> agreement (NCV)

> treaty

If you have translated Romans 11:27, Luke 1:72, or Acts 3:25, see your translation there.

#### 11:19c–d

**there were flashes of lightning, and rumblings, and peals of thunder, and an earthquake, and a great hailstorm:** The Greek clause is literally “lightning, noises, peals of thunder, an earthquake and a great hailstorm occurred.” Other ways to translate this clause are:

> lightning, distant and loud thunder, an earthquake, and a great hailstorm occurred/happened

> Then there were flashes of lightning, noises, thunder, an earthquake and a great hailstorm. (NCV)

> Then lightning flashed, thunder rumbled and roared/crashed, the earth shook/quaked, and much hail fell.

#### 11:19c

**And there were flashes of lightning, and rumblings, and peals of thunder,**

* And there was lightning, rumbling/rolling thunder, crashes of thunder,
* Lightning flashed, storm noises occurred, thunder boomed loudly,

**rumblings:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *rumblings* is literally “sounds/voices.” Here the word probably refers to the “rolling” sound of thunder and probably the wind. See how you translated this word in 4:5 or 8:5\.

**peals of thunder:** This phrase refers to the loud booming noises of thunder.

#### 11:19d

**and an earthquake, and a great hailstorm.**

* and there was an earthquake and a severe/heavy storm of hail.
* the earth/ground shook, and much rain fell in the form of ice.

**earthquake:** This word refers to the ground shaking strongly.

**great hailstorm:** The word “hail” refers to frozen rain. A piece of hail can be as small as a raindrop or bigger than a fist. Big hail falling from the sky can do much damage and even kill people. The words *great hailstorm* refer to a great amount of probably big hail falling from the clouds. Some languages do not have a word for hail. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > storm of frozen rain

    > storm of rain turned to ice

    > storm of balls of ice

    > storm of cold hard rain

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > The word “hail” refers to frozen rain. A piece of hail can be as small as a raindrop or bigger than a fist.

    > See footnote on hail at 8:7\.

See how you translated the word “hail” in 8:7\.

## Revelation 12:1 (id: 523011)

### Section 12:1–17: The woman fled from the dragon

In this section, John saw several signs or symbols representing spiritual reality. The first sign was a woman, representing the people of God. The second sign was a dragon, representing Satan. The woman was about to give birth, and the dragon wanted to kill the child. The child is symbolic of Jesus as the Christ. God took the son to heaven and protected the woman.

In 12:7–12, John interrupted the story of the woman and the dragon to tell about the war between the dragon and the angels. These verses help explain why the dragon wanted to kill the woman. In 12:13, John continued the story of the woman and the dragon.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The sign of the dragon chasing the woman

> The vision of the woman and the dragon

> The spiritual conflict of God’s people and Satan

#### 12:1a

**And a great sign appeared in heaven:**

* ¶ A great sign/portent appeared in heaven,
* ¶ A spectacular/amazing sign came into view/sight in heaven.

**And a great sign:** The Greek phrase that the BSB literally translates as *a great sign* refers to something that has a symbolic meaning. A *sign* suggests or points to something other than itself. Other ways to translate the Greek phrase are:

> a great and wondrous sign (NIV84\)

> a great and mysterious sight (GNT)

> a great portent (RSV)

> a great wonder (KJV)

**great:** Here the word *great* refers to the intensity or importance of the sign. The word does not refer to size here. Other ways to translate this word are:

> spectacular

> amazing

**appeared:** This word indicates that before this time the sign was not visible and then suddenly it was visible.

**heaven:** The Greek word can mean either “heaven” or “sky.” There are two ways to interpret the Greek word:

1. The word means heaven here, as in the BSB. This word refers generally to the location where John saw these things. The vision appeared or occurred in the spiritual realm. *(BSB, RSV, NIV, NJB, NASB, NLT, NET, REB, NCV, ESV, KJV)*
2. The word means sky here. This word further indicates that the sign appeared above the ground with the sky as its background. For example:

    > the sky (GNT) *(GNT, NABRE, GW, CEV)*

People in John’s time generally understood the spiritual realm to be up in the sky. Greek only has one word to refer to both heaven and sky. Some languages, like English, have two different words. If that is true in your language, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because the same Greek word in 11:19 clearly refers to heaven.Beale (page 625\), Aune (page 650\), Lenski (page 361\), Osbourne (page 455\), Smalley (page 299\), Hughes (on TW), and Kistemaker (page 351\) support interpretation (1\).

#### 12:1b–c

The symbols of the sun, moon, and twelve stars indicate that the woman probably represents Israel. Or it may represent all people who believe in Jesus as the Christ. These believers are then represented as the spiritual Israel. In either case, the woman represents the people of God.

#### 12:1b

**a woman clothed in the sun, with the moon under her feet**

* a woman with the sun as her clothing, the moon under her feet,
* It was a woman. Her clothes were the sun. The moon was under her feet.

**a woman clothed in the sun:** This clause refers to the sun covering the woman like clothing covers a person. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> a woman whose clothes were the sun (CEV)

> a woman robed with the sun (REB)

**with the moon under her feet:** This phrase can mean either:

1. The bottom of the woman’s feet touched the moon.
2. The moon was a small distance below her feet.

Translate this phrase so that it allows both meanings. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> and who had the moon under her feet (GNT)

> and the moon was under her feet (NCV)

#### 12:1c

**and a crown of twelve stars on her head.**

* and a wreath/crown made of twelve stars.
* Her head was wreathed/encircled with twelve stars.

**a crown of twelve stars on her head:** The phrase *on her head* is emphasized in the Greek. For example:

> on her head a crown of twelve stars (RSV)

> her head was crowned/wreathed with twelve stars

If possible, emphasize the phrase *on her head* in a way that is natural in your language.

**a crown of twelve stars:** This phrase probably indicates that the stars were placed around her head like a crown. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> a crown/wreath made of twelve stars

> twelve stars in a circle like a crown

**crown:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *crown* refers to a victor’s wreath. It was worn on the head as a sign of having won a contest.

But here, the word probably refers to the twelve stars placed around her head so that it looked like a wreath of stars. Other ways to translate this word are:

> wreath

> headdress

## Revelation 12:2 (id: 523015)

### Section 12:1–17: The woman fled from the dragon

In this section, John saw several signs or symbols representing spiritual reality. The first sign was a woman, representing the people of God. The second sign was a dragon, representing Satan. The woman was about to give birth, and the dragon wanted to kill the child. The child is symbolic of Jesus as the Christ. God took the son to heaven and protected the woman.

In 12:7–12, John interrupted the story of the woman and the dragon to tell about the war between the dragon and the angels. These verses help explain why the dragon wanted to kill the woman. In 12:13, John continued the story of the woman and the dragon.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The sign of the dragon chasing the woman

> The vision of the woman and the dragon

> The spiritual conflict of God’s people and Satan

#### 12:2

**She was pregnant and crying out in the pain and agony of giving birth.**

* She was pregnant, and she shouted in pain because she was about/ready to have her baby.
* She was about to bear a child and shouted/screamed because of the labor pains.

**She was pregnant and crying out in the pain and agony of giving birth:** The phrase *in the pain and agony of giving birth* indicates that it was time for her baby to leave the womb. Some English versions combine the meaning of *She was pregnant* and *giving birth*. For example:

> She was about to give birth,… (CEV)

**She was pregnant:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *She was pregnant* is literally “She had (a child) in her womb.” Use a polite word or phrase that refers to a pregnant woman.

**crying out in the pain and agony:** Here the phrase *crying out* refers to shouting with emotion because of the labor pains. For example:

> was screaming in labor pains (NET)

> shouted because of the pain of her labor/childbirth

## Revelation 12:3 (id: 523016)

### Section 12:1–17: The woman fled from the dragon

In this section, John saw several signs or symbols representing spiritual reality. The first sign was a woman, representing the people of God. The second sign was a dragon, representing Satan. The woman was about to give birth, and the dragon wanted to kill the child. The child is symbolic of Jesus as the Christ. God took the son to heaven and protected the woman.

In 12:7–12, John interrupted the story of the woman and the dragon to tell about the war between the dragon and the angels. These verses help explain why the dragon wanted to kill the woman. In 12:13, John continued the story of the woman and the dragon.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The sign of the dragon chasing the woman

> The vision of the woman and the dragon

> The spiritual conflict of God’s people and Satan

#### 12:3a

**Then another sign appeared in heaven:**

* ¶ And another great sign/portent appeared in heaven,
* ¶ Then another spectacular/amazing sign came into sight/view in heaven.

**Then another sign appeared in heaven:** This verse continues the vision that began in 12:1\. Translate the words *sign* and *heaven* as you did in 12:1\.

#### 12:3b

**a huge red dragon with seven heads,**

* and look/hey, a huge red dragon with seven heads,
* It was a very large, red, fierce, winged serpent/reptile called a dragon! It had seven heads

12:3b begins with the Greek words that mean “and look.” The word emphasizes or calls attention to the words that follow. The words also probably indicate surprise or suddenness. The word “look” here is not a command to look at something. Other ways to translate this word are:

> indeed/hey,

> and what should appear but

> Suddenly/Unexpectedly,

**huge:** This word means “very big.”

**dragon:** This word refers to a creature that is mythical. It refers to a large land animal or possibly a large sea animal. A Greek mosaic done about 300 years before Jesus was born shows one type of Greek dragon:

A sculpture on a wall in Babylon was done around 300 years before Jesus was born. It shows their thoughts about what a dragon looked like:

This next illustration is from a Persian artist about 1430 AD:

They are usually considered to be much larger than people. Dragons were usually thought to be fierce and dangerous. Here the *dragon* symbolizes something evil, namely Satan.

Some languages do not have a word for *dragon*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a generic word for a fierce, mythical creature. For example:

    > monster

* Describe *dragon* by using a fierce animal known today as a basis. For example:

    > fierce snake/lizard

    > crocodile

* Use the word for a similar dangerous mythical creature that your readers already know about. You may then want to explain the Greek word in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Literally: “dragon.” This is a mythical creature that was large and fierce.

* Use the major language word for *dragon*. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > A dragon is a mythical creature. They were thought to be large and fierce. They were often described as something like a lizard or reptile.

The *dragon* is a symbol for Satan. In some languages a literal translation would not indicate that the *dragon* is a symbol for Satan. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain the symbol in a footnote. Some example footnotes are:

> The dragon/lizard is a symbol for Satan.

> The dragon/lizard represents Satan.

#### 12:3c

**ten horns, and seven royal crowns on his heads.**

* and there were ten horns and seven crowns on his heads.
* with a king’s/ruler’s headdress on each head indicating he was king/ruler. It also had ten horns on its heads.

**ten horns:** These verses do not say how seven heads had *ten horns* on them. You should not try to explain the meaning in your translation.

**horns:** This word refers to animal horns. The horn was a symbol of strength.

**seven royal crowns on his heads:** Each head had a crown on it.

**royal crowns:** This word refers to the decorated metal circles that kings usually wear on their heads. The *royal crowns* here are a symbol of authority to rule people.

The Greek word here is different than the Greek word that the BSB translates as “crown” in 12:1c. In some languages people are not familiar with *royal crowns*. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

> headpieces/hats of rulers

> headdresses of authority

See how you translated this word in 4:4\.

## Revelation 12:4 (id: 523018)

### Section 12:1–17: The woman fled from the dragon

In this section, John saw several signs or symbols representing spiritual reality. The first sign was a woman, representing the people of God. The second sign was a dragon, representing Satan. The woman was about to give birth, and the dragon wanted to kill the child. The child is symbolic of Jesus as the Christ. God took the son to heaven and protected the woman.

In 12:7–12, John interrupted the story of the woman and the dragon to tell about the war between the dragon and the angels. These verses help explain why the dragon wanted to kill the woman. In 12:13, John continued the story of the woman and the dragon.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The sign of the dragon chasing the woman

> The vision of the woman and the dragon

> The spiritual conflict of God’s people and Satan

#### 12:4a

**His tail swept a third of the stars from the sky, tossing them to the earth.**

* His tail dragged a third part of the stars from the sky and threw/hurled them to the earth.
* He swept the sky with his tail and pulled/dragged one of every three stars from the sky. Then he threw them down to the earth.

**His tail swept a third of the stars from the sky, tossing them to the earth:** These clauses probably refer to the great power of the dragon. There are many interpretations of these clauses, so you should not explain their meaning in your translation.

**His tail swept a third of the stars from the sky:** The word *swept* refers to gathering *a third of the stars*. The motion of the dragon’s tail caused the stars to move.

In some languages it is more natural to make the dragon itself the subject of the clause. For example:

> With his tail he dragged a third of the stars out of the sky (GNT)

**a third of the stars:** Here the word *third* means “one out of every three.” For example, in a group of three thousand stars, one thousand stars fell to earth. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> one part in three parts of the stars

> one of every three stars

> one part of the stars and two parts not

**tossing them to the earth:** The word *tossing* means “throwing.” After the dragon gathered a third of the stars with his tail, he threw them to earth. For example:

> threw them down to the earth (GNT)

#### 12:4b

**And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth,**

* The dragon stood waiting in front of the woman who was about to birth the child,
* He went and remained standing in front of the woman who was about to bear the baby,

**And the dragon stood before the woman:** The Greek grammar probably indicates that after the dragon threw the stars to the earth he stood before the woman and remained there waiting for some time. For example:

> the dragon stopped in front of the woman (NJB)

**the dragon:** The BSB translates the Greek literally here. But the previous sentence and this sentence are both about the dragon. In some languages a pronoun would be more natural. For example:

> He

#### 12:4c

**ready to devour her child as soon as she gave birth.**

* in order to eat her child whole as soon as he/it was born.
* so that he could swallow/consume her child as soon as she birthed/bore him.

**devour:** This word refers to eating something completely. For example:

> eat the whole child

> consume

**her child:** The word *child* does not indicate whether the child is male or female. But some languages must explicitly say “male\-child” or “female\-child.” If that is true in your language, you should say “male\-child” (12:5a).

* **Associated Passages:** REV 12:4

## Revelation 12:5 (id: 523019)

### Section 12:1–17: The woman fled from the dragon

In this section, John saw several signs or symbols representing spiritual reality. The first sign was a woman, representing the people of God. The second sign was a dragon, representing Satan. The woman was about to give birth, and the dragon wanted to kill the child. The child is symbolic of Jesus as the Christ. God took the son to heaven and protected the woman.

In 12:7–12, John interrupted the story of the woman and the dragon to tell about the war between the dragon and the angels. These verses help explain why the dragon wanted to kill the woman. In 12:13, John continued the story of the woman and the dragon.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The sign of the dragon chasing the woman

> The vision of the woman and the dragon

> The spiritual conflict of God’s people and Satan

#### 12:5a

**And she gave birth to a son, a male child,**

* She birthed a son, a baby boy,
* She bore a son.

**a son, a male child:** The Greek words are literally “a son, a male.” The phrase *a male child* emphasizes the fact that the child was male. Some languages have another way to emphasize the meaning. For example:

> a son, indeed, a boy

In some languages *son* and *male child* are translated in the same way. If that is true in your language, translate with only one phrase. For example:

> a son (GNT)

If possible, translate the emphasis in another way. See General Comment on 12:5a–b for other ways to translate the emphasis.

#### 12:5b

**who will rule all the nations with an iron scepter.**

* who will rule all nations forcefully with an iron staff/stick.
* He will lead/govern all people groups to their destruction with a club made of iron.

**who will rule all the nations with an iron scepter:** This clause tells the reader more about the son. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that the woman gave birth to other sons and only this one *will rule all the nations with an iron scepter*. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about the son. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> He will rule all the nations with an iron scepter.

**will rule all the nations with an iron scepter:** Translate these words as you did in 2:27\. They have the same meaning here. If you are unclear as to the meaning, see the notes there. Here these words refer to the son (12:5a), not believers.

**nations:** Here the word *nations* can refer to language groups as well as groups under one government. If possible, use a word or phrase that allows either meaning.

##### **General Comment on 12:5a–b**

In 12:5a the baby is described as both a son and a male child to emphasize the fact that the child was male. In some languages it is more natural to make the phrase “male child” the subject of the following clause (12:5b). For example:

> 5aShe gave birth to a son. This boy 5bwill rule all nations…

> 5aThe woman was delivered of a boy, 5bthe son who was to rule all the nations… (NJB)

#### 12:5c

**And her child was caught up to God and to His throne.**

* And her child was grabbed and taken up to God and to his throne.
* But someone quickly lifted her child to God and to his place/seat of ruling.

This sentence resumes describing the vision from 12:5a.

**And:** There is some contrast between what the dragon wanted to do (12:4c) and what happened here. In some languages translating the contrast is more natural. For example:

> but (RSV)

**her child was caught up:** Here the word *caught up* refers to taking the child away quickly and forcefully. He *was caught up* in order to rescue him from danger. Here the word does not refer to stealing or taking him wrongfully.

This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. Probably God commanded someone to snatch her child. For example:

> God caused/commanded someone to snatch her child

> someone quickly took her child

**to God and to His throne:** In some languages it is more natural to add another verb or verbs here. For example:

> and taken to God and to his throne (GW)

> He was taken to God and placed on his throne (CEV)

**His throne:** The pronoun *His* probably refers to God,as Beale, Beckwith, Smalley, and Kistemaker say. but may refer to the child.as Johnson and Aune say. You should not explain in your translation to whom the word *His* refers here.

**throne:** This word refers to the official chair of a king. It is a symbol of his power to rule. Here the word *throne* indicates that God rules heaven and earth.

See how you translated this word in 1:4\.

## Revelation 12:6 (id: 523023)

### Section 12:1–17: The woman fled from the dragon

In this section, John saw several signs or symbols representing spiritual reality. The first sign was a woman, representing the people of God. The second sign was a dragon, representing Satan. The woman was about to give birth, and the dragon wanted to kill the child. The child is symbolic of Jesus as the Christ. God took the son to heaven and protected the woman.

In 12:7–12, John interrupted the story of the woman and the dragon to tell about the war between the dragon and the angels. These verses help explain why the dragon wanted to kill the woman. In 12:13, John continued the story of the woman and the dragon.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The sign of the dragon chasing the woman

> The vision of the woman and the dragon

> The spiritual conflict of God’s people and Satan

#### 12:6a

**And the woman fled into the wilderness, where God had prepared a place for her**

* The woman escaped into the wilderness to a place that God prepared for her,
* She ran/escaped to a desolate place. God had already prepared that place for her,

**And the woman fled into the wilderness, where God had prepared a place for her:** God prepared the place for the woman before she arrived. In some languages a time word or other phrase will be needed to make that clear. For example:

> The woman fled into the desert to a place that God had prepared for her earlier

> The woman fled into the desert to a place. God had prepared that place for her beforehand

**wilderness:** The Greek word the BSB translates as *wilderness* refers to a place that is empty, desolate, or uninhabited. Other ways to translate this word are:

> desert (NIV84\)

> desolate region

> empty land

This word occurs in Matthew 3:1, Mark 1:3, Luke 3:2, and John 1:23\. If you have translated any of these verses, see how you translated the word there.

**where God had prepared a place for her:** This Greek clause is more literally “where she has a place prepared by God” (RSV). This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause, as the BSB does.

#### 12:6b

**to be nourished for 1,260 days.**

* where she was to be looked after for twelve hundred and sixty days. (REB)
* so that God’s angels could provide for her. They did so for 1,260 days.

**to be nourished for 1,260 days:** This clause indicates the purpose for fleeing to that place. It is implied that she was actually taken care of there for that many days. After the woman fled (12:6a), angels began to take care of her.

The Greek grammar probably indicates that the *1,260 days* began at this point. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> where they took care of her for 1,260 days

> so she could be taken care of for 1,260 days (NET)

**to be nourished:** The Greek clause is literally “they might take care of her.” It probably indicates that God’s angels took care of her. But the pronoun “they” does not clearly refer to anyone in the previous verses. So some English versions use a passive clause as the BSB does. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> they might take care of her

> God’s angels might take care of her

**nourished:** The Greek word refers to providing food, but it is implied that shelter and other needs were also provided. Other ways to translate this Greek word are:

> taken care of (NIV)

> looked after (NJB)

**1,260:** The Greek phrase uses number words: “one\-thousand two\-hundred sixty.” See how you translated this in 11:3\.

#### 12:7a

**Then a war broke out in heaven:**

* ¶ There was war in heaven.
* ¶ And great battles/fighting occurred in heaven.

**Then a war broke out in heaven:** The Greek clause is literally “And war was in heaven.” The Greek does not say when this war occurred. Scholars have many opinions about when it occurred. If possible, refer only generally to war in heaven, as the Greek and BSB do.

**Then:** Here the conjunction *Then* introduces another event. It does not make explicit when this other event took place.

**war:** This word refers to fighting by organized groups. Michael and his angels fought in an organized manner. The dragon and his angels also fought in an organized manner. This war was fought with the supernatural weapons of angels. It was not fought with earthly weapons such as guns.

In some languages it is not possible to talk of war without saying who was fighting. See the General Comment at the end of 12:7a–c.

#### 12:7b

**Michael and his angels fought against the dragon,**

* Michael and his angels battled/struggled against/with the dragon.
* The angel Michael and other angels with him made war against the dragon,

**Michael:** This name refers to one of God’s leading angels. He watches over Israel (Daniel 12:1, Jude 9\).

**and his angels:** Michael and these angels followed God. During the war they followed Michael’s command.

**fought:** The Greek word refers to fighting a war. For example:

> had to fight a war (GW)

> battled (JBP)

#### 12:7c

**and the dragon and his angels fought back.**

* The dragon and his evil angels battled/struggled with/against them.
* and the dragon and his demons made war in return.

**the dragon and his angels:** Satan (the dragon) was the leader of a group of angels. These angels are usually referred to as “demons” or “evil spirits” in the New Testament. If the word you use for *angels* only refers to good spirit beings, you may want to:

##### **General Comment on 12:7a–c**

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > the dragon and his evil angels

    > the dragon and the angels that follow him

* Use the word “demons.” For example:

    > the dragon and his demons *You may then want a footnote to explain the meaning of demons here. For example:*

    > Literally: “angels.” Demons are the same kind of being as angels, but demons follow Satan and oppress people.

In some languages it is necessary to say who was fighting. It is not possible to simply say “there was war.” For example:

> 7aAnd in heaven 7bMichael and his angels were fighting against the dragon. 7cThe dragon and his angels fought back.

#### 12:8a

**But the dragon was not strong enough,**

* But the dragon did not have enough strength/power to win,
* But the dragon lost the war,

**the dragon was not strong enough:** There is a textual issue here:

1. Some Greek manuscripts have he. For example:

    > he was too weak (REB) *(BSB, NIV, GNT, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, REB, ESV, NCV, KJVThe KJV has no pronoun here, but the Textus Receptus has the singular verb indicating “he.”)*

2. Some Greek manuscripts have they. For example:

    > they were defeated (RSV) *(RSV, NJB, NASB, NABRE)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\). The clause here focuses on the dragon as the leader. But both the dragon and his angels lost the war.

**the dragon:** The Greek is literally “he.” The pronoun refers to the dragon, as the BSB makes explicit. In some languages people may think this pronoun refers to Michael. If that is true in your language, you may want to clearly refer to the dragon, as the BSB models.

**was not strong enough:** This phrase indicates that the dragon and his army lost the war. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> was too weak (REB)

> was defeated (GNT)

> lost the battle (NLT)

#### 12:8b

**and no longer was any place found in heaven for him and his angels.**

* and they were no longer permitted to enter heaven.
* so the dragon and his demons were not allowed to be in heaven anymore.

**no longer was any place found in heaven for him and his angels:** This clause indicates that God no longer allowed them into heaven. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> there was no longer any place for them in heaven (RSV)

> he and his angels were not allowed to stay in heaven any longer (GNT)

> God no longer permitted them to enter heaven

> they were forced out of heaven

### Section 12:1–17: The woman fled from the dragon

In this section, John saw several signs or symbols representing spiritual reality. The first sign was a woman, representing the people of God. The second sign was a dragon, representing Satan. The woman was about to give birth, and the dragon wanted to kill the child. The child is symbolic of Jesus as the Christ. God took the son to heaven and protected the woman.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The sign of the dragon chasing the woman

> The spiritual conflict of God’s people and Satan

#### 12:9a

**And the great dragon was hurled down—**

* The huge dragon was thrown down,
* Michael and his angels threw the great dragon down to earth.

**And the great dragon was hurled down:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> Michael and his angels threw the great dragon down

**great:** This word means “big.” It is the same Greek word that the BSB translates as “huge” in 12:3b. Here, the word may include the implied meaning of “powerful.”

#### 12:9b–c

**that ancient serpent called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world:** John tells the reader more about the dragon here. With the long dash at the end of 12:9a, the BSB indicates that 12:9b–c is added information. The NLT uses the long dash before and after this added information. See the General Comment on 12:9a–c below for other ways to naturally include this added information.

#### 12:9b

**that ancient serpent called the devil and Satan,**

* namely, that serpent/snake of ancient times called the Devil/Slanderer and Satan,
* That dragon, he is that serpent of long ago times. He is named the Demon Chief and/or Satan.

**ancient serpent:** The word *ancient* indicates that the serpent lived long ago. Now he has lived a very long time. This phrase implies that the serpent is the same serpent that tempted Adam and Eve. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> serpent of that time long ago

> serpent of ancient times (JBP)

**serpent:** This is another word for a snake. Dragons are also sometimes called serpents. The word *serpent* here reminds readers of the snake in the Garden of Eden story. If you have translated Genesis 3:1, use the same word for *serpent* here.

**called the devil and Satan:** The Greek words are literally “the one being called the devil and Satan.” It explains that the dragon in the vision is actually the devil, who is also named Satan. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> who is called the Devil and Satan (RSV)

> named the Devil, or Satan (GNT)

**devil:** The Greek word here is literally “slanderer.” A slanderer is someone who says false things about someone to try to ruin that person’s reputation, name, or status. This word is used like a title for Satan. Make it clear that this word is used like a title:

> Devil (GNT)

Some ways to translate *devil* are:

* Use a local name or idiom that refers to the chief of all demons. For example:

    > Left\-handed One

    > Barking One

* Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > leader of the evil spirits

    > spirit enemy of God

* Translate its meaning. For example:

    > Slanderer

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with the meaning of this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > The word “Devil” in Greek means “slanderer.” *But if you already included this footnote at 2:10, you may not want to repeat it here.*

See how you translated this word in 2:10\.

**Satan:** The word *Satan* is the Hebrew name of the leader of all the evil spirits. The Hebrew word means “enemy.” But it is used as a proper name in the New Testament. See how you translated this word in 2:9\.

#### 12:9c

**the deceiver of the whole world.**

* the one who deceives the entire world.
* He has tricked people all over the world.

**the deceiver of the whole world:** This clause tells the reader more about Satan. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other beings named Satan and only this one is *the deceiver of the whole world*. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about Satan. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> He is the deceiver of the whole world.

**the deceiver:** This phrase refers to deceiving people and persuading them to do wrong things. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> who leads the whole world astray (NIV)

> who has been leading people all over the world to sin

**the whole world:** Here this phrase refers to all the people throughout the whole world.

##### **General Comment on 12:9a–c**

Added information about the dragon comes after the main verb of 12:9\. In some languages it is more natural to present the added information differently than the BSB. For example:

> 9a–cThe great dragon, the primeval serpent, known as the devil or Satan, who had led all the world astray, was hurled down (NJB)

In some languages it is more natural to put the added information in a separate sentence. For example:

> 9aThe great dragon was hurled down. 9bIt/He is that ancient serpent called the devil or Satan. 9cHe leads the whole world astray.

> The great dragon 9bis that ancient serpent called the devil or Satan, 9cwho leads the whole world astray. 9aHe was hurled down.

#### 12:9d

**He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.**

* Yet he had been thrown to the earth along with his evil angels.
* Indeed, Michael and his angels had thrown him and his demons to the earth.

**He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him:** This clause continues the story after John described the dragon in 12:9b–c. The Greek words are literally “he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him” (as in the RSV). The BSB does not repeat the verb phrase “thrown down,” because it is not required in English.

This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> Michael and his angels threw him and his angels/demons to the earth

##### **General Comment on 12:9a–d**

The dragon and his angels were thrown to earth only once. But the word “thrown” appears in 12:9a and 12:9d. The word “thrown” in 12:9d refers again to the event in 12:9a.

In some languages translating the word “thrown” in both 12:9a and 12:9d would indicate that they were thrown twice. If that is true in your language, you should:

* Indicate that 12:9d refers to the same event as 12:9a. For example:

    > 9aThe great dragon was hurled down—9bthat ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, 9cwho leads the whole world astray. Indeed, 9dhe was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.

* Combine 12:9d with 12:9a. For example:

    > 9aThe great dragon was hurled down 9dto the earth, and his angels with him. He is 9bthat ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, 9cwho leads the whole world astray.

* Use only the evil angels as the subject in 12:9d. For example:

    > 9a–cThe great dragon, the primeval serpent known as the devil or Satan, who had led all the world astray, was hurled down to the earth 9dand his angels were hurled down with him. (NJB)

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The sign of the dragon chasing the woman

> The vision of the woman and the dragon

> The spiritual conflict of God’s people and Satan

#### 12:10a

**And I heard a loud voice in heaven saying:**

* ¶ Then I heard loud speech/words in heaven saying,
* ¶ Then I heard someone in heaven say loudly,

**a loud voice in heaven:** John does not say who spoke here, but it does not refer to God (12:10b). Use a phrase that refers to anyone (except God) in heaven. For example:

> loud speech in heaven

> someone say loudly in heaven

#### 12:10b–c

**Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of His Christ:** Here the phrase *have come* indicates that God’s *salvation*, *power*, *kingdom*, and Christ’s *authority* are now present and completely in effect.

In many languages it is not possible or natural to use the word *come* with the words *salvation*, *power*, *kingdom*, and *authority*. If that is true in your language, you may need to translate differently. For example:

> the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ have been completed/achieved

> God’s salvation has arrived! His power is at work! His kingdom is present! Christ’s authority is in effect!

> This is the time when our God finishes the work of saving people, the time of his full power and kingdom, and this is the time when his Christ has full authority.

#### 12:10b

**“Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God,**

* “Our(incl) God’s salvation, power, and kingdom have now fully come,
* “Now at last our(incl) God has saved us in every way! He has used his power fully and begun to reign without limit!

**Now:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Now* is emphatic. It indicates that finally the time had come. For example:

> It has come at last (NLT)

**the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God:** The phrase *of our God* belongs to all three nouns: *salvation*, *power*, and *kingdom*. For example:

> our God’s salvation, power, and kingdom

**salvation:** This word refers to saving people from hell, death, or danger. Here it also refers to saving people from the deceiver, Satan. The word is a noun that refers to an event. In some languages it is more natural to use a phrase with a verb here. For example:

> saving/freeing by God of his people

> for God to save mankind

> saving from death

See how you translated this word in 7:10\.

**kingdom:** This word refers to a group of people ruled by one king. For example:

> empire (NJB)

Here the word *kingdom* probably refers to the fact that God rules over all things. For example:

> kingship

> position of ruling over all things

See how you translated this word in 1:6 or 5:10\.

#### 12:10c

**and the authority of His Christ.**

* as well as his Christ’s authority.
* His Christ’s authority is in full force

**authority:** This word refers to having the right and power to control or rule over someone or something. Here the word is general and indicates that Jesus has the right and power to do anything he chooses to do.

**Christ:** The word *Christ* is a title for Jesus. It means “the anointed one.” See how you translated this word in 1:1 or 11:15\.

##### **General Comment on 12:10b–c**

The BSB has placed the verb phrase “have come” before the subject. This is a formal English poetic style. In the Greek the verb is in the normal place for a Greek clause. You should place it in the normal place for your language. For example, the RSV says:

> the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have come

##### **General Comment on 12:10b–c**

In some languages it is more natural to translate this exclamation as two or more sentences. For example:

> Now God’s salvation has come! Now God has shown his power as King! Now his Messiah has shown his authority! (GNT)

#### 12:10d

**For the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down—**

* For the blamer of our(incl) brothers has been thrown down,
* because Michael and his angels have thrown down the one who accuses our fellow believers of sin.

**For:** This conjunction introduces the basis for 12:10b–c. 12:10d–f indicate why the salvation, power, kingdom, and authority are in full effect. For example:

> because (NET)

**accuser:** This word refers to someone who claims another person has done wrong. Here the word refers to Satan. Satan is always going to God and accusing believers of sinning. Other ways to translate this word are:

> the one who always accuses

> continually blaming person

**brothers:** This word refers generally to both men and women believers. For example:

> brothers and sisters (NLT)

**has been thrown down:** The clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> they threw him down

12:10d–e puts the focus on Satan. Some languages may need to reorder the 12:10d–e. For example:

> For Michael and his angels 10ehave thrown down 10dthe accuser of our brothers, 10fwho accuses them day and night before our God .

> For Michael and his angels 10ehave thrown down 10dthe accuser of our brothers. 10fHe accused them day and night before our God.

##### **General Comment on 12:10d–e**

Both 12:10d and 12:10e use a form of the word “accuse.” In some languages it is more natural to combine 12:10d–e. For example:

> Satan accuses our people in the presence of God day and night. Now he has been thrown out! (CEV)

#### 12:10e

**he who accuses them day and night before our God.**

* who blames them for sinning before our(incl) God day and night.
* He used to accuse them before God constantly.

**he who accuses them day and night before our God:** The clause *he who accuses them day and night before our God* tells the reader more about the accuser (12:10d). In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other accusers and only this one *accuses them day and night before our God*. If that is true in your language, translate these words so that they tell more about the accuser. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> 10ehas been hurled down. 10fHe accuses them before our God day and night.

**day and night:** This phrase indicates that Satan accuses believers all the time.

#### 12:11a

**They have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb**

* They defeated him through the sacrifice of the blood of the Lamb
* Our(incl) fellow believers conquered him by the Lamb’s sacrificial death on the cross

**They:** The pronoun *They* refers to believers (12:10d) here.

**conquered:** This word means “triumphed” or “obtained victory.” Here it refers to having success over Satan in all the ways he tried to defeat them. Other ways to translate this word are:

> overcame (NIV)

> have defeated (NLT)

**by the blood of the Lamb:** This phrase refers figuratively to the death of Jesus. Jesus’ death was a sacrifice that makes believers pure before God.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate a different meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > by the blood of the Lamb through his death

    > by the blood of the Lamb by his sacrifice on the cross

* Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:

    > through the blood sacrifice of the Lamb

    > by the Lamb’s sacrificial death on the cross

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. For example:

    > This phrase refers figuratively to the death of Jesus. Jesus died as a sacrifice to make believers pure before God.

**Lamb:** This word refers to a young sheep. Here, it is used as a title for Jesus. Many English versions capitalize the word *Lamb* here to indicate it is used as a title. See how you translated this word in 5:6 or 7:17\.

#### 12:11b

**and by the word of their testimony.**

* and through the witness/testimony they told others.
* and by their words of witnessing/testifying.

**by the word of their testimony:** There are several ways to interpret the Greek phrase. The main interpretations are:

1. It means by the word to which they testified. They testified about the gospel of Jesus. For example:

    > by the word to which they bore witness (NJB) *(GNT, NJB, CEV, NCV)*

2. It means by the word that consists of their testimony. They testified and their own words are important here. For example:

    > by the witness they bore (REB) *(NLT, REB)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).Beale (page 664\) says, “the emphasis lies on Christians testifying to others about their Lord.” However, if a literal translation implies interpretation (1\), you may want to translate literally. For example:

> by the word of their testimony (RSV)

**testimony:** The word *testimony* means “the words spoken about what one saw.” It implies that the spoken words are truthful and accurate. Other ways to translate this word are:

> witness (REB)

> message about what happened

Some languages translate this meaning using a verb. For example:

> speaking about what they know

See how you translated this word in 1:2\.

#### 12:11c

**And they did not love their lives so as to shy away from death.**

* Also, they did not love their lives so much that they refused to die for Jesus’ sake.
* Indeed, they did not love their lives most, and they were not afraid to die rather than deny/renounce/reject Jesus.

**And:** This word introduces a further explanation of how the believers overcame Satan. 12:11c describes the third way that believers overcame Satan. For example:

> and (NASB)

> for (RSV)

Some English versions do not translate this word, but choose to leave the connection with 12:11b implicit. Do what is most natural in your language.

**they did not love their lives so as to shy away from death:** When unbelievers ordered these believers to deny Jesus, they refused. So the unbelievers killed them. The believers were willing to die rather than be unfaithful to Jesus. Other ways to translate this are:

> they did not love their lives so much that they were afraid to die (NLT)

> faced with death they did not cling to life (REB)

> they continued to believe even though that lead to their death

> they did not love their life most, but rather they held strong to their faith and let themselves be killed

### Section 12:1–17: The woman fled from the dragon

In this section, John saw several signs or symbols representing spiritual reality. The first sign was a woman, representing the people of God. The second sign was a dragon, representing Satan. The woman was about to give birth, and the dragon wanted to kill the child. The child is symbolic of Jesus as the Christ. God took the son to heaven and protected the woman.

In 12:7–12, John interrupted the story of the woman and the dragon to tell about the war between the dragon and the angels. These verses help explain why the dragon wanted to kill the woman. In 12:13, John continued the story of the woman and the dragon.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The sign of the dragon chasing the woman

> The vision of the woman and the dragon

> The spiritual conflict of God’s people and Satan

#### 12:12a

**Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and you who dwell in them!**

* For those reasons, you(plur) heavens and all who dwell in them, rejoice!
* On account of those things, all who live in heaven, rejoice/celebrate!

**Therefore:** This conjunction introduces what should be done based on the fact that Michael and his angels threw the dragon and his angels down (12:9–10\).Mounce, Smalley, Johnson. Considering the rest of this verse, it seems most likely the connection is to 12:9–10 rather than 12:11\. But some scholars (for example, Beale and Osbourne) include 12:11\. Other ways to translate this word are:

> For this reason, (NASB)

> Because of that,

**rejoice, O heavens, and you who dwell in them!:** The direct address is after the command. In some languages it is more natural to have the direct address first. For example:

> you heavens and you who dwell in them, rejoice!

**rejoice:** This word is a command. In some languages it is not natural to command people to rejoice. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Change the command to an exhortation. For example:

    > you heavens and you who dwell in them, let us rejoice

* Change the command to a time clause. For example:

    > you heavens and you who dwell in them, now is the time to rejoice

* Use the verb “celebrate” (or similar verb) to indicate rejoicing indirectly. For example:

    > you heavens and you who dwell in them, celebrate

**O heavens, and you who dwell in them!:** The loud voice speaks to the *heavens* as though they were people. The phrase *you who dwell in them* refers to the angels who live with God in heaven.

In some languages it is not natural to speak directly to the *heavens*. If that is true in your language, you may want to refer to the angels and other beings in the *heavens*. For example:

> everyone and everything in the heavens

> all who dwell in heaven

**heavens:** At that time many people thought that heaven had several layers. Each layer was a different “heaven.” But in the New Testament the plural *heavens* has the same meaning as the singular “heaven.” In some languages the singular “heaven” is more natural. See the above example.

#### 12:12b

**But woe to the earth and the sea;**

* How terrible for the earth and the sea,
* But there will be great trouble for all creatures/beings on the earth and in the seas;

**But:** The Greek does not have a conjunction here. However, many English versions add *But* to indicate the contrast between 12:12a and 12:12b.

**woe to the earth and the sea:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *woe* here means “There will be trouble for (someone).” The word indicates sorrow about the troubles. The speaker was saying that the earth and the sea are to be pitied, for they will soon have great trouble. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> how terrible for the earth and the sea (GNT)

> alas for the earth and the sea (JBP)

> great trouble comes to the earth and the sea

**the earth and the sea:** This phrase refers to the whole world and implies all the creatures that live there.

**sea:** The word *sea* refers to a large body of water. A *sea* is often so large that someone standing on one side cannot see the other side. The word *sea* is symbolic, so you should not name a particular *sea*. See how you translated this word in 5:13 or 10:2\.

#### 12:12c

**with great fury**

* He is very angry,
* with fierce anger, (GW)

The Greek wording of 12:12c begins with a conjunction that is often translated as “because” or “for.” It introduces the reason for the warning to the earth and the sea. For example:

> because (NIV)

Some English versions, like the BSB, do not translate this conjunction, but leave the connection with 12:12b implicit.

**with great fury:** This clause indicates that the devil is very angry. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> He is filled with anger (NCV)

> he is very angry (CEV)

> He is furious

#### 12:12d

**the devil has come down to you,**

* because the Devil/Slanderer has descended to you(plur)/them.
* the Demon Chief has come down to you,

**the devil has come down to you:** This clause indicates that the devil left heaven and went to the earth.

**you:** Here the pronoun *you* refers to the earth and the sea (12:12b). In some languages it is more natural to use the pronoun “them.”

#### 12:12e

**knowing he has only a short time.”**

* because he knows that he has little time left.”
* for he knows that little time is left to him.”

**knowing he has only a short time:** The devil knew that he only had a short time left to accomplish his purposes. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> knowing that he has little time left (NJB)

> he knows that he does not have much time to do what he wanted to do

#### 12:13a

**And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown to the earth,**

* ¶ When the dragon saw/realized that he had been thrown down to the earth,
* ¶ After the dragon saw that Michael and his angels had thrown him to the earth,

**saw that:** Here the word *saw* means “realized” (as in the GNT). For example:

> found himself (NJB)

**he had been thrown:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> Michael and his angels had thrown him

This clause refers to an event that had happened earlier (12:9\). Indicate that this event has already happened.

#### 12:13b

**he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child.**

* he hurried after the woman who had born a son, intending to harm her.
* he chased the woman, the mother of the baby boy.

**pursued:** There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as *pursued*:

1. The word means chased here. For example:

    > hunted for (NCV) *(BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NABRE, NLT, NET, REB, NCV, ESV)*

2. The word means persecuted here. For example:

    > persecuted (NASB) *(NASB, GW, CEV, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).Aune (page 704\), Swete (page 157\), Lenski (page 381\), and Kistemaker (page 367\) support interpretation (1\). But Beale (page 668, Osbourne (page 482\), and Smalley (page 330\) say it has both meanings here. The dragon chased the woman in order to harm her.

**the woman who had given birth to the male child:** This phrase refers to the woman of 12:1–6\. For example:

> the woman, the mother of the male child (NJB)

#### 12:14a

**But the woman was given two wings of a great eagle**

* But the woman was given two wings of a big eagle,
* Someone gave to the woman two wings like those of a huge eagle,

**But:** There is some contrast here between the dragon chasing the woman and God helping the woman. Some English versions choose not to translate this conjunction; they leave the connection with 12:13 implicit.

**the woman was given two wings of a great eagle:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> God gave the two wings of a great eagle to the woman

> Someone gave the two wings of a great eagle to the woman

> God caused/ordered someone to give to the woman the two wings of a great eagle

> The woman received the two wings of a great eagleIn some languages “take” and “receive” is translated by the same verb. The English verb “receive” implies that someone gave the wings, but the English verb “take” does not imply that. Your translation should imply or indicate that someone gave it.

**two wings of a great eagle:** This phrase indicates that the wings looked like eagle’s wings. The wings were powerful and enabled her to fly fast. Your translation should not indicate that God removed an eagle’s wings to give to the woman. The CEV changes the phrase to a simile:

> two wings like those of a huge eagle

**eagle:** An *eagle* is a large bird that is sometimes aggressive. It has strong wings and can fly very well. Eagles weigh about 5 kilograms (11 pounds) and are about 1 meter (3 feet) in length.

See how you translated this word in 4:7 or 8:13\.

#### 12:14b

**to fly from the presence of the serpent to her place in the wilderness,**

* so that she would fly to the place prepared for her in the wilderness.
* so she could fly to the place that God had prepared for her in an empty land.

**to fly:** This clause indicates purpose. God gave eagle’s wings to the woman so that she could fly to the place that God prepared for her. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> so that she could fly (NASB)

> to fly away (NJB)

**from the presence of the serpent:** The Greek phrase is literally “away from the presence of the serpent” (as in the NET). The woman will fly away from the serpent so that he will not be able to harm her. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> safe from the dragon’s attack (GNT)

> and the serpent cannot harm her there

**serpent:** The word *serpent* still refers to the dragon (Satan) here (12:9b). See how you translated this word in 12:9\.

**to her place:** The BSB literally translates the Greek here. The Greek phrase refers to “where God had prepared a place for her” (12:6a). Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the place prepared for her (NIV)

> that place of hers

**wilderness:** The Greek word the BSB translates as *wilderness* refers to a place that is empty, desolate, or uninhabited. See how you translated this word in 12:6\.

#### 12:14c

**where she was nourished for a time, and times, and half a time.**

* In that place she would be provided with food and her other needs for one time/year, two times/years, and half a time/year.
* There God’s angels would provide for her for three and a half years.

**where she was nourished:** This clause tells the reader more about the place in the desert. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other places that she went to, and God’s angels only took care of her in this one. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about the place in the desert. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> She would be taken care of there.

**she was nourished:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> God’s angels would nourish her

**a time, and times, and half a time:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *time* refers to a period of time. Here it refers to a year. Therefore, the phrase refers to one year, two years, and half a year, for a total of three and a half years. It refers to the same amount of time as the 1,260 days (12:6\).Aune (page 706\). Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> a time, two times, and half a time (CEV)

> three and a half years (REB)

> one year then two years then half a year

#### 12:15a

**Then from the mouth of the serpent spewed water like a river**

* Then the serpent/snake gushed water like a river from his mouth
* The serpent/dragon spat/vomited a large amount of water, like a river.

**from the mouth of the serpent spewed water like a river:** In the Greek, the phrase *from the mouth of the serpent* is not emphasized like it is in the BSB. For example:

> the serpent vomited water from his mouth, like a river (NJB)

**serpent:** The devil is referred to as “the dragon” in 12:3b–13a. He is also referred to as “the dragon” in 12:16b–12:1a and following verses. The devil is referred to as the *serpent* in 12:9b and here.

The change from “dragon” to *serpent* here is probably only for poetic style. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer to someone other than the devil. If that is true in your language, you may want to use the word “dragon” here.

**spewed water like a river:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *spewed* is literally “threw.” But the action is “from his mouth,” so in English the natural translation is “vomited water” (as in the NJB). Also, the simile *like a river* explains that it was a large amount of water. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> forcefully poured water

> spouted water (NET)

> tried to drown the woman with a flood of water that flowed from his mouth (NLT)

#### 12:15b

**to overtake the woman and sweep her away in the torrent.**

* to catch the woman and carry her away with the flood.
* He hoped/wanted to drown her in its rushing flood.

**to overtake the woman and sweep her away in the torrent:** This clause indicates the purpose or desire of the serpent. He wanted to catch the woman and *sweep her away* in the water to drown her. However, this did not happen. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> so that the flood would carry her away

> to sweep her away with the flood (RSV)

In some languages it is more natural to refer to the water. For example:

> so that the water would overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent

**overtake:** This refers to the water moving faster than the woman as she fled. Then the water would reach her and carry her away.

**sweep her away:** Here the words *sweep her away* refer to lifting the woman off her feet and carrying her away in the rushing flood. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> carry her off

> wash her away

> sweep her away by a flood (NET)

It is implied that the woman would drown in the flood. For example:

> to drown her in its flood (JBP)

#### 12:16a

**But the earth helped the woman and opened its mouth**

* But the earth helped the woman by opening its own mouth
* But God helped the woman by causing the earth to open a large crack like a mouth.

#### 12:16b

**to swallow up the river that had poured from the dragon’s mouth.**

* and swallowing the river that the dragon/serpent had gushed out of his mouth.
* The river that the dragon/serpent had spat/vomited out flowed into the crack/mouth as if swallowed.

#### 12:16a–b

**But the earth helped the woman and opened its mouth to swallow up the river:** The earth is referred to as if it were a person. The earth is pictured as helping the woman. It is also pictured as having a *mouth* that could swallow.

In some languages the meaning of a literal translation would not be clear. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use similes for *mouth* and *to swallow*. For example:

    > But the earth helped the woman by opening a large crack like a mouth, and the whole river flowed in as if swallowed

* Refer to God as the one who helped the woman and caused these events to happen. For example:

    > But God helped the woman by causing the earth to open its mouth and swallow the river

* Change the metaphors into similes and refer to God causing these events to happen. For example:

    > But God helped the woman by causing the earth to open a large crack like a mouth and the whole river flowed in as if swallowed

#### 12:17a

**And the dragon was enraged at the woman,**

* Then the dragon was furious at the woman

**enraged:** This word means “very angry.” For example:

> furious (GNT)

#### 12:17b

**and went to make war with the rest of her children,**

* and went to make war against the rest of her children,
* and left in order to battle/fight her other children.

**make war:** This phrase refers to fighting with organized groups. Usually nations *make war* with armies. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> fight a war

> battled

See how you translated the word *war* in 12:7\.

Satan makes war against believers by trying to make their faith weak. He makes war by tempting them to sin, deceiving them into believing false teaching, and causing evil people to persecute them.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer only to fighting. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain the meaning in a footnote. For example:

> Satan makes war against believers by trying to make their faith weak. He does this by tempting them to sin, deceiving them into believing false teaching, and causing others to persecute them.

**children:** Here this word refers figuratively to believers, as explained in 12:17b.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer to children, not believers. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > spiritual children

    > children regarding faith in God

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. For example:

    > The word “children” refers figuratively to believers, as explained in 12:17c.

#### 12:17c

**who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus.**

* namely, those who obey God’s commands and have Jesus’ message.
* They are those who obey what God commands and who always follow what Jesus taught.

**commandments:** This word refers in general to the commands that God has given to people.

**hold to the testimony of Jesus:** There is a textual issue in 12:17c: (1\) The early Greek manuscripts have the name Jesus (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some later Greek manuscripts have the phrase Jesus Christ (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. There are several ways to interpret the Greek words here. The main interpretations are:

1. It means believers are faithful to the testimony that Jesus gave. For example:

    > are faithful to the truth revealed by Jesus (GNT) *(GNT, NJB, CEV, NCV)*

2. It means believers continue to testify/witness about Jesus. For example:

    > maintain their witness to Jesus (REB) *(RSV, NABRE, NLT, NET, REB)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).Mounce (on TW), Lenski (page 387\), Kistemaker (page 370\), and Beckwith (page 630\) support interpretation (1\). Swete (page 160\), Smalley (page 334\), and Hughes (on TW) support interpretation (2\). However, if a literal translation implies interpretation (1\), you may want to translate literally. For example:

> hold to the testimony of Jesus (NASB)

**testimony:** The word *testimony* means “the words spoken about what one saw.” See how you translated this word in 1:2 or 6:9\.

#### 12:17d

**And the dragon stood on the shore of the sea.**

* He went and stood on the seashore.
* The dragon came and stood on the beach.

See the General Comment below about the different locations that 12:17d is placed in various English versions.

**And the dragon stood on the shore of the sea:** There is a textual issue here:

1. The earliest Greek manuscripts say he stood. The pronoun “he” refers to the *dragon* (12:17\). For example:

    > And he stood on the sand of the sea. (RSV) *(BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NASB, NABRE, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, REB, ESV, NCV)*

2. Some later Greek manuscripts say I stood. The pronoun “I” refers to John. For example:

    > And I stood upon the sand of the sea (KJV) *(KJV, NJB)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\), as the UBS4 does.

**dragon:** This word refers to a mythical creature that is something like a huge lizard. See how you translated this word in 12:3\.

##### **General Comment on 12:17d**

The people who divided the Greek text into chapters and verses long ago probably had manuscripts that followed option (2\) above. So they understood this Greek clause to be part of chapter 13\. However, many English versions follow option (1\). It indicates that the Greek clause connects to the topic in 12:13–17\.

Several ways to indicate that the Greek clause connects to the topic in 12:13–17 are:

* Include the clause at the end of 12:17, as the BSB does. For example:

    > 12:17Then the dragon was angry with the woman, and went off to make war on the rest of her offspring, on those who keep the commandments of God and bear testimony to Jesus. And he stood on the sand of the seashore.

    > 13:1And I saw a beast rising out of the sea, (RSV)

* Keep the clause as 13:1a but indicate that it belongs with 12:17\. For example:

    > 12:17Furious with the woman, the dragon went off to wage war on the rest of her offspring, those who keep God’s commandments and maintain their witness to Jesus. 13:1He took his stand on the seashore.

    > Then I saw a beast rising out of the sea. (REB)

* Mark the clause as a new verse: 12:18\. For example:

    > 12:17…and are faithful to the truth revealed by Jesus. 18And the dragon stood on the seashore.

    > 13:1Then I saw a beast coming up out of the sea. (GNT)

Place this clause so that it clearly indicates its meaning here. You may want to see where the major language version puts it.

* **Associated Passages:** REV 12:17

* **Associated Passages:** REV 12:18

## Revelation 13:1 (id: 523048)

### Section 13:1–10: The first beast rose from the sea

In this section, John saw a beast rise from the sea and described him. The dragon gave authority to this beast. The beast slandered God. The beast killed believers. Non\-believers worshiped him.

If you followed option (2\) for the textual issue at 12:17d, you should have this section heading before 12:17d.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The beast from the sea

> The beast that blasphemed God

#### 13:1a

**Then I saw a beast with ten horns and seven heads rising out of the sea.**

* ¶ Then I saw a beast rising from the sea, which had ten horns and seven heads,
* ¶ Then I saw a monster ascending from the sea. He/It had ten horns and seven heads,

**Then I saw a beast with ten horns and seven heads rising out of the sea:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *Then* introduces the clause *I saw a beast…rising out of the sea*. Introduce or begin this clause naturally in your language. For example:

> Then I saw a beast coming up out of the sea. (GNT)

> I saw a beast coming out of the sea (GW)

**a beast:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *beast* does not have the Greek article (the English definite article is “the”) in front of it. So the English versions translate this as *a beast*. But 17:3–8 makes it clear that the beast of 11:7 is the same beast here. You should not indicate that the beast here is different from the beast in 11:7\.

**beast:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *beast* refers to any animal, often a wild animal. The BSB uses the word *beast* to imply that this being is fierce, dangerous, and evil. Here the word refers to one of Satan’s servants.

In some languages a literal translation would not clearly indicate the symbolic meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a word that clearly refers to an evil creature or being. For example:

    > monster

* Explain the symbol in a footnote. For example:

    > The word “beast” refers to one of the devil’s servants. His servants are evil, fierce, and dangerous like wild beasts.

See how you translated this word in 11:7\.

**with ten horns and seven heads:** The beast has the same number of horns and the same number of heads as the dragon (12:3b–c). You should translate literally, as you did in 12:3\.

**horns:** This word refers to horns that are like animal horns.

**rising out of the sea:** The Greek verb indicates the direction “up.” The beast somehow rose from under the surface of the sea and went to the shore. For example:

> rising out of the sea (RSV)

> ascending from the bottom of the sea

**sea:** The word *sea* refers to large bodies of water. A *sea* is often so large that someone standing on one side cannot see the other side. In Hebrew culture, the *sea* was a symbol of chaos. Some languages do not have a word or phrase for “sea.” If that is true in your language, you may want to describe it in your translation. For example:

> the saltwater place

> large body of water

> large round water

#### 13:1b

**There were ten royal crowns on its horns**

* and ten crowns on his horns.
* and a headdress on each horn indicating that he was king.

**There were ten royal crowns on its horns:** Probably each horn had a crown on it.

**royal crowns:** This word refers to a decorated metal circle that kings usually wear on their heads. The *royal crowns* here are symbols of the authority to rule people.

In some languages people are not familiar with *royal crowns*. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

> headpieces/hats of rulers

> headdresses of authority

See how you translated this word in 12:3\.

#### 13:1c

**and blasphemous names on its heads.**

* Each head had a name that insulted God.
* A name that dishonored/slandered God was written on each head.

**blasphemous names on its heads:** The words “there were” are implied from 13:1b. In some languages it is more natural to include those words here. For example:

> there were blasphemous names on its heads

Probably each horn had a different blasphemous name.

**blasphemous names:** The word *blasphemous* refers to slandering God. The words may say that God is evil. Or they may say that someone else is the true God. The *blasphemous names* slandered God in some way. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> a name that was insulting to God (GNT)

> names that dishonored God

> names that greatly slandered God

### Section 13:1–10: The first beast rose from the sea

In this section, John saw a beast rise from the sea and described him. The dragon gave authority to this beast. The beast slandered God. The beast killed believers. Non\-believers worshiped him.

If you followed option (2\) for the textual issue at 12:17d, you should have this section heading before 12:17d.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

#### 13:2a

**The beast I saw was like a leopard,**

* The beast that I saw looked like a leopard,
* The monster was like a fierce animal called a leopard.

**The beast I saw was like a leopard:** In some languages it may not be necessary to repeat the phrase *I saw*. For example:

> This beast looked like a leopard. (NCV)

**leopard:** A *leopard* is a big cat like a jaguar, tiger, or panther, but smaller. It has tan skin with black spots. They are about 1\.5 meters (5 feet) long, excluding the tail. They weigh between 40 and 70 kilograms (90–150 pounds). They eat other animals.

In some languages people are not familiar with leopards. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use the major language word for *leopard* and perhaps add a descriptive word or phrase. For example:

    > fierce leopard/jaguar

* Describe a *leopard*. For example:

    > a fierce animal called a leopard

    > a spotted puma/panther/tiger

    > a large, fierce cat called a leopard *But using the word “cat” should not imply that it is about the size of a house cat.*

#### 13:2b

**with the feet of a bear**

* but its feet looked like the feet of a bear,
* It had big, hairy paws with long claws similar to a bear.

**with the feet of a bear:** A bear’s foot is big and hairy with long claws.

In some languages people are not familiar with bears. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Add a description of the feet. For example:

    > big, hairy feet with long claws like those of a bear

* Describe the feet without referring to a bear. For example:

    > big, hairy feet with long claws *Then you may want to indicate the literal words in a footnote, using the major language word for bear. For example:*

    > Literally: “feet like bear’s feet.”

    > Literally: “feet like bear’s feet.” A bear’s foot is big and hairy with long claws.

**feet:** In some languages it is more natural to use a word that refers to the feet of animals. For example:

> paws (NJB)

#### 13:2c

**and the mouth of a lion.**

* and its mouth looked like the mouth of a lion.
* It had a large mouth with sharp teeth similar to a lion.

**the mouth of a lion:** A *lion* has a large mouth with sharp teeth. In some languages people are not familiar with lions. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Add a description of the mouth. For example:

    > large mouth with sharp teeth like that of a lion

* Describe the mouth without referring to a lion. For example:

    > large mouth with sharp teeth

You may want to explain the literal words in a footnote, using the major language word for *lion*. For example:

> Literally: “a mouth like a lion’s mouth.”

> Literally: “a mouth like a lion’s mouth.” A lion has a large mouth with sharp teeth.

#### 13:2d

**And the dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority.**

* The dragon gave his power, throne, and great authority to the beast.
* The dragon permitted/caused the monster to have/use the same power that he had. He permitted/caused the monster to rule with the same great authority.

**And the dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority:** The dragon shared his power, throne, and authority with the beast. For example:

> The dragon gave the beast his own power, his throne, and his vast authority (GNT)

**power:** This word refers to the ability to do something. The dragon was strong and powerful. He caused the beast to become strong and powerful too.

**throne:** This word refers to the official chair of a king. When the king is seated on his *throne*, he rules over his people and his country. Therefore, the *throne* is a symbol for authority to rule. The dragon ruled as king, and he caused the beast to rule also. Other ways to translate this word are:

> chair of ruling people

> leader’s place to rule

See how you translated this word at 1:4\.

**authority:** This word refers to having the right and power to control or rule over someone or something. Here the word is general. The dragon had the right and power to do as he wanted. He shared this right and power with the beast.

#### 13:3a

**One of the heads of the beast appeared to be mortally wounded.**

* It appeared that one of the heads of the beast was wounded to death,
* One of the monster’s heads looked as if it had been killed,

**appeared to be mortally wounded:** The Greek phrase can be translated literally as “as having been killed to death.” It indicates that John saw that one head of the beast had a very bad wound. It was the kind of wound that kills. The Greek words are similar to the description of the Lamb in 5:6\.

John saw the scar from the wound but also saw that the head was alive at this time. So he used “as.” 13:12 makes it clear that the wound was “of death,” that is, the head had died.Beale (page 688\) says, “The wound appeared to be fatal, and, indeed, it was.” Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> as if it had been slain (NASB)

> as it were wounded to death (KJV)

> had a fatal/deadly wound

13:14 indicates that the head was killed with a sword.

**mortally wound:** This phrase refers to a wound that would cause the death of someone. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> wounded to death (JBP)

> deadly injury

This wound is explained in 13:14d as a sword wound. Some languages must say what kind of wound it is. If that is true in your language, refer to a sword wound or deep cut.

#### 13:3b

**But the mortal wound was healed,**

* but the wound was healed.
* but the fatal/deadly wound was healed, and the head lived again.

**But the mortal wound was healed:** These verses do not say whether the wound healed on its own or whether someone healed it. Your translation should allow for either meaning. If possible, do not say that someone healed it. For example:

> the fatal wound was healed

> the wound had healed (GNT)

#### 13:3c

**and the whole world marveled and followed the beast.**

* All people around the world were amazed, and they followed him.
* All the people of the world were amazed that the monster still lived, and they gave allegiance to him.

**the whole world:** The word *world* refers to people here. For example:

> All the people of the world (GW)

Believers did not follow the beast (13:8\).

**marveled:** This word implies that people *marveled* because the beast still lived after receiving a fatal wound. In some languages people will think that the people *marveled* for another reason. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

> astonished because the beast/head was healed

**followed:** Here the word *followed* refers to obeying or learning from the beast. The word does not refer to walking behind it. Other ways to translate this word are:

> gave allegiance to (NLT)

> submitted to

> became disciples of

In this section, John saw a beast rise from the sea and described him. The dragon gave authority to this beast. The beast slandered God. The beast killed believers. Non\-believers worshiped him.

If you followed option (2\) for the textual issue at 12:17d, you should have this section heading before 12:17d.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The beast that blasphemed God

#### 13:4a

**They worshiped the dragon**

* They worshiped/honored the dragon
* All the people of the world revered the dragon

**They worshiped:** The Greek clause that the BSB literally translates as *They worshiped* refers to the people of the world (13:3c). For example:

> Everyone worshiped (GNT)

**worshiped:** This word refers to honoring someone or something as sacred/divine. The people honored the dragon and the beast as though they were gods. Other ways to translate this word are:

> venerated

> revered

See how you translated this word in 4:10\. However, note that in that verse the elders worshiped the one true God.

#### 13:4b

**who had given authority to the beast,**

* because he had given the/that authority to the beast.
* because he had caused the monster to have/use his great authority.

#### 13:4c

**and they worshiped the beast,**

* They also worshiped/honored the beast
* They also revered the monster

#### 13:4b–c

**authority:** This word refers to the dragon’s authority in 13:2d. The RSV translates this as:

> his authority

#### 13:4d

**saying, “Who is like the beast,**

* and asked, “Is there anyone as great as the beast?
* and said, “No one is like the monster! He alone is great!

#### 13:4e

**and who can wage war against it?”**

* Is there anyone who can defeat the beast in war/battle? Indeed, no one!”
* No one can defeat him!”

#### 13:4d–e

**Who is like the beast, and who can wage war against it?:** These questions are rhetorical questions. They both imply the answer “No one.” They emphasize the people’s belief that no one is like the beast and no one can beat him in war. They praised the beast with these rhetorical questions. Translate these rhetorical questions in a way that emphasizes their belief. Some ways are:

* Use rhetorical questions. For example:

    > Who is as great as the beast? Who can battle the beast and win?

    > Is there anyone like the beast? Is there anyone who can defeat the beast?

* Use statements. For example:

    > There is no one as great as the beast! There is no one who can defeat the beast in battle!

    > No one is like this beast! No one can fight against it. (CEV)

## Revelation 13:5 (id: 523056)

### Section 13:1–10: The first beast rose from the sea

In this section, John saw a beast rise from the sea and described him. The dragon gave authority to this beast. The beast slandered God. The beast killed believers. Non\-believers worshiped him.

If you followed option (2\) for the textual issue at 12:17d, you should have this section heading before 12:17d.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The beast from the sea

> The beast that blasphemed God

#### 13:5a

**The beast was given a mouth to speak arrogant and blasphemous words,**

* ¶ The beast was allowed to boast and blaspheme
* ¶ The monster received permission to speak boastfully and insult/slander God.

**The beast was given a mouth to speak arrogant and blasphemous words:** The phrase *was given a mouth* is an idiom. It probably indicates that God allowed the beast to speak these *arrogant and blasphemous words*. For example:

> The beast was allowed to make proud claims which were insulting to God (GNT)

**The beast was given a mouth:** The clause is passive. Some ways to translate it are:

* Use a passive clause. For example:

    > A mouth was given to the beast

    > The beast was allowed to speak (GW)

* Use an active clause. Probably the dragon gave the words to say, as he gave authority in 13:2d. (God allowed all these things in 13:1–8, but John was speaking about the dragon and the beast in these verses.) For example:

    > The dragon gave the beast a mouth/message

* Use a verb that implies that someone gave the words to say. For example:

    > The beast received permission to speakIn some languages “take” and “receive” is translated by the same verb. The English verb “receive” implies that someone gave the power, but the English verb “take” does not imply that. Your translation should imply or indicate that someone gave it.

**arrogant…words:** The Greek word is literally “great (things).” Here the Greek word refers to boasting. For example:

> boasts (NJB)

**blasphemous words:** The word *blasphemous* refers to words which slander God. It may refer to saying that God is evil. It may also refer to claiming that someone else is the true God. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> claims which were insulting to God (GNT)

> sayings that dishonor God

> things/words that greatly slander God

See how you translated the similar word “blasphemous” in 13:1\.

#### 13:5b

**and authority to act for 42 months.**

* and to use his authority for forty\-two months.
* He also received permission to use his authority for 42 months.

**authority to act:** The Greek words are literally “was given authority to it to do.” The two ways to interpret the Greek words are:

1. It indicates that the beast was allowed to use the authority that the dragon had given him. For example:

    > it was allowed to use its power (NCV) *(BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NASB, NABRE, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, ESV, NCV)*

2. It indicates that the beast was permitted to continue boasting and speaking blasphemy. For example:

    > was granted permission to continue (REB) *(NJB, REB, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).Osbourne (page 499\) says, “the beast has authority…to “trample the holy city” (11:2\) and persecute the saints (13:7\). The word “give” is implied from 13:5a. Probably the dragon gave permission, as in 13:5a. Other ways to translate this are:

> it was permitted to have authority (GNT)

> the dragon gave to him the right to use his authority

**42 months:** This is the same amount of time as the 1,260 days in 12:6b, but counted in months. The Greek uses number words. There are several ways to translate this meaning:

* Use number words. For example:

    > forty\-two months (NIV)

* Use numerals, as the BSB does.

Some languages have difficulty with big numbers. If that is true in your language, use a different time word. For example:

> three and a half years

> three years and six months

## Revelation 13:6 (id: 523057)

### Section 13:1–10: The first beast rose from the sea

In this section, John saw a beast rise from the sea and described him. The dragon gave authority to this beast. The beast slandered God. The beast killed believers. Non\-believers worshiped him.

If you followed option (2\) for the textual issue at 12:17d, you should have this section heading before 12:17d.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The beast from the sea

> The beast that blasphemed God

#### 13:6a

**And the beast opened its mouth to speak blasphemies against God**

* He began to blaspheme God
* He started insulting God

#### 13:6a–b

**the beast opened its mouth:** This is an idiom that means “he began to talk.” In some languages a literal translation would not have that meaning. If that is true in your language, translate the meaning of the idiom. For example:

> It/He began

A similar idiom occurs in Matthew 5:2, where the BSB translates it as “he began to.” If you have translated that verse, see how you translated the idiom there.

**to speak blasphemies against God and to slander His name and His tabernacle:** The Greek is literally “in blasphemies against God to blaspheme his name and his tent.” There are two ways to interpret the connection between “in blasphemies against God” and “to blaspheme his name and his tent”:

1. The phrase “to slander his name and his tabernacle” describes the meaning of “blasphemies against God” here. That is why the BSB translates these words as they do. Another way to translate these words is:

    > to utter blasphemies against God, that is, blaspheming his name and his dwelling *(RSV, ESV, NABRE, NLT, NET, REB)*

2. The phrase “to slander his name and his tabernacle” is in addition to “blasphemies against God” here. For example, the NJB says:

    > blasphemies against God, against his name, his heavenly Tent *(BSB, NIV, GNT, NJB, CEV, NCV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because it fits the Greek grammar better.The Greek has “to blaspheme” rather than “and blaspheme.” Aune, Mounce, Hughes, and Lenski support interpretation (1\).

#### 13:6b

**and to slander His name and His tabernacle—those who dwell in heaven.**

* and tell lies about him and his tent/tabernacle, that is, those who live in heaven.
* and speaking evil of him and where he dwells, namely, with everyone who lives in heaven.

**to slander his name:** This phrase refers to saying evil things about who God is and what he stands for.Mounce (page 250\). Beale and Osbourne say the use here refers to putting oneself in God’s place, but it is hard to prove that this specific meaning is intended here. Other ways to translate this word are:

> lying about who he is

> evil things said against his name

See how you translated this word in 2:9, where the BSB translates it as “slander.”

**His tabernacle—those who dwell in heaven:** There is a textual issue here:

1. The Greek words are his tent, those tent\-living in heaven. The last phrase explains “his tent.” For example:

    > his dwelling, that is, those who dwell in heaven (RSV) *(BSB, RSV, NASB, NLT, GW, NET, REB, ESV)*

2. The Greek words are his tent **and** those tent\-living in heaven. The last phrase is in addition to “his tent.” For example:

    > the place where he lives, and all those who live in heaven (GNT) *(NIV, GNT, NJB, NABRE, CEV, NCV, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT recommends it.Beale and Aune support option (1\).

**His tabernacle:** A more literal translation of this Greek phrase is “his tent.” It figuratively refers to heaven, where God lives. Other ways to translate this are:

> his tent (GW)

> the place where he lives (GNT)

According to interpretation (2\) above, this phrase refers to heaven.

**those who dwell in heaven:** This phrase refers to the angels, elders, and other beings living in heaven. Translate it in a way that allows for all these beings. For example:

> everyone who lives in heaven with God (CEV)

## Revelation 13:7 (id: 523059)

### Section 13:1–10: The first beast rose from the sea

In this section, John saw a beast rise from the sea and described him. The dragon gave authority to this beast. The beast slandered God. The beast killed believers. Non\-believers worshiped him.

If you followed option (2\) for the textual issue at 12:17d, you should have this section heading before 12:17d.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The beast from the sea

> The beast that blasphemed God

#### 13:7a

**Then the beast was permitted to wage war against the saints and to conquer them,**

* He was allowed to make war against the believers and to defeat them.
* The dragon gave power/authority to him to fight God’s holy people and overcome them.

**Then the beast was permitted to wage war:** The Greek phrase is literally “to make war was given to it.” For example, the NASB says:

> It was also given to him to make war

But in many languages a literal translation would not be grammatical or make sense. If that is true in your language, there are two ways to interpret this phrase:

1. It refers to being given permission to make war. For example, the NLT says:

    > the beast was allowed to wage war *(BSB, RSV, NJB, NABRE, ESV, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, REB)*

2. It refers to being given the power to make war. For example, the NCV says:

    > It was given power to make war *(NIV, NCV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because it seems the more natural implied meaning in the Greek here.Aune and Smalley support interpretation (1\). This author found no commentary that explained why one interpretation was better than the other. The Greek phrase implies that the beast did indeed make war against the saints (and conquer them). Your translation should imply or indicate that.

**was permitted:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. As in 13:5, probably the dragon gave this power. For example:

> The dragon gave to him

> he received permissionIn some languages “take” and “receive” is translated by the same verb. The English verb “receive” implies that someone gave the power, but the English verb “take” does not imply that. Your translation should imply or indicate that someone gave it.

**the saints:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *saints* means “holy ones.” Here the word refers generally to believers. For example:

> God’s people (GNT)

See how you translated this word in 5:8 or 8:3\.

**to conquer them:** The phrase “was given to it” is implied but not repeated here. In some languages it is more natural to repeat it. For example:

> he was permitted/allowed to conquer them

**conquer:** This word means “defeat and rule over.” The beast would defeat the believers. Then he would decide whether to kill them, put them in prison, or give some other punishment to them. For example:

> defeat (GNT)

#### 13:7b

**and it was given authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.**

* And he was allowed to rule every tribe/clan, people/land, language, and nation.
* And he received power to control every tribe, every people\-group, every language, and every country.

**it was given authority:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. Again, probably the dragon gave the authority. For example:

> the dragon gave to him authority

> he received authorityIn some languages “take” and “receive” is translated by the same verb. The English verb “receive” implies that someone gave the authority, but the English verb “take” does not imply that. Your translation should imply or indicate that someone gave it.

**every tribe and people and tongue and nation:** The word *every* connects to each of the four kinds of groups. For example:

> every tribe, every language, every people, and every nation

See how you translated this phrase in 5:9 or 11:9\. But note that the order of the groups is different here.

### Section 13:1–10: The first beast rose from the sea

In this section, John saw a beast rise from the sea and described him. The dragon gave authority to this beast. The beast slandered God. The beast killed believers. Non\-believers worshiped him.

If you followed option (2\) for the textual issue at 12:17d, you should have this section heading before 12:17d.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The beast from the sea

> The beast that blasphemed God

#### 13:8a–c

**And all who dwell on the earth will worship the beast—all whose names have not been written…:** All of 13:8b–c explains the meaning of the phrase *all who dwell on the earth*. Here it refers to all people except believers. The names of believers were written in the Book of Life. For example:

> All people living on earth will worship it, except those whose names were written… (GNT)

#### 13:8a

**And all who dwell on the earth will worship the beast—**

* All the people living on the earth will worship/honor the beast,
* All those on the earth will revere the beast,

**who dwell on the earth:** The word *who dwell* refers to people living somewhere. These people *who dwell* lived on *the earth*. So this phrase refers to all people alive, except believers (13:8b–c).

#### 13:8b

**all whose names have not been written from the foundation of the world in the Book of Life**

* except the people whose names have been written in the Book of Life before the world/universe was created.
* namely, those whose names the Lamb did not write in the book. The Lamb wrote the names of those to whom he will give eternal life in that book. He wrote the names before he made the earth/universe.

**all whose names have not been written:** The clause *whose names have not been written* is passive. Some languages must use an active or intransitive clause. Probably Jesus wrote the names, because this book is his. For example:

> all whose names that the Lamb has not written

> all whose names were not

**from the foundation of the world:** This phrase refers to when God wrote some names but did not write these names.

**from:** In other occurrences of the phrase “from the creation” in the NT, the word *from* indicates that the event in those verses occurred at or before creation. So it is likely here that these names were written at or before creation.See Revelation 17:8, Matthew 13:35 and 25:34\. Therefore, some English versions use “before” to be more clear here. For example:

> before the foundation of the world (RSV)

**the foundation of the world:** This phrase uses the noun *foundation* to describe an event. Some ways to translate it are:

* Use a passive clause. For example:

    > the world was created

* Use an active clause. For example:

    > God/he created the world

* Translate without using a verb. For example:

    > the founding/beginning of the world

**world:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *world* here probably refers to all created things. For example:

> universe

> all that God created

> creation (CEV)

**the Book of Life:** This phrase refers to a *Book* that has the names of people to whom God will give eternal *Life*. Some languages need to explain the word *of*. For example:

> the book in which are the names of those who have eternal life

> the book with/having the names of those to whom God will give eternal life

See how you translated this phrase in 3:5\.

#### 13:8c

**belonging to the Lamb who was slain.**

* That book belongs to the Lamb who was killed.
* It is his book. People killed him on the cross.

**the Lamb who was slain:** The clause *who was slain* tells the reader more about the Lamb. The phrase *the Lamb* here is the symbolic title for Jesus. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other people with the symbolic title *the Lamb*. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about *the Lamb*. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> the Lamb. He was slain.

> the Lamb. He was killed on the cross.

> the Lamb. He was killed but he lives again.

**the Lamb:** This is a title for Jesus. Jewish people killed a lamb at the Passover as a sacrifice to God. The lamb has symbolic meaning as a special sacrifice and is a symbol for the Christ. See how you translated this title in 5:6 or 7:14\.

**who was slain:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. Here it is not important to indicate who killed the Lamb. For example:

> the Lamb whom people/they killed

##### **General Comment on 13:8b–c**

There are four things said here:

1. Some people’s names were written in the Book of Life and some people’s names were not written in it.
2. The names were written before God made the universe.
3. That Book of Life belongs to the Lamb.
4. The Lamb was slain.

In some languages it is more natural to use another sentence or several sentences for some of this information. For example:

> all whose names have not been written in the Book of Life before the creation of the world. That book belongs to the Lamb that was slain.

> all whose names have not been written in the Book of Life. That book is the Lamb’s book. He wrote the names in it before the creation of the world. He was slain but he lives again.

In this section, John saw a beast rise from the sea and described him. The dragon gave authority to this beast. The beast slandered God. The beast killed believers. Non\-believers worshiped him.

If you followed option (2\) for the textual issue at 12:17d, you should have this section heading before 12:17d.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The beast from the sea

> The beast that blasphemed God

#### 13:9

**He who has an ear, let him hear:**

* ¶ If someone has ears, let him hear these words.
* ¶ Since you(plur) have ears that can hear, then listen(plur) to this:

**He who has an ear, let him hear:** This saying urges readers to think carefully about what was about to be said next. It is similar in meaning to the same saying in 2:7, but here it refers to what John is about to say. For example:

> If someone has ears, let him hear this:

> Since you(plur) have ears that can hear, then listen(plur) to this:

See how you translated this saying in 2:7 or 3:22\.

### Section 13:1–10: The first beast rose from the sea

In this section, John saw a beast rise from the sea and described him. The dragon gave authority to this beast. The beast slandered God. The beast killed believers. Non\-believers worshiped him.

If you followed option (2\) for the textual issue at 12:17d, you should have this section heading before 12:17d.

#### 13:10a

**“If anyone is destined for captivity, into captivity he will go;**

* If anyone is to be taken captive, then he will surely/certainly be taken captive.
* Anyone who is destined for prison will be taken to prison. (NLT)
* If God has decided that people/they catch and jail you, then they will catch and jail you.

**If anyone is destined for captivity, into captivity he will go:** There is a textual issue in 13:10a: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the text if anyone into captivity. Many English versions add the verb “be” or “go” here (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some later Greek manuscripts have the text if anyone leads (others) into captivity (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT recommends it. These words indicate that God is in control. If God plans for someone to be made a prisoner, then that will happen. Other ways to translate these words are:

> Whoever is meant to be captured will surely be captured (GNT)

> Anyone who is destined for prison will be taken to prison. (NLT)

> If God plans for you to be caught and jailed, then you will be caught and jailed

#### 13:10b

**if anyone is to die by the sword, by the sword he must be killed.”**

* If anyone is to be killed by the sword, then he will surely/certainly be killed by the sword.
* Anyone destined to die by the sword will die by the sword. (NLT)
* If God has decided that people/they will purposely kill you, then they will kill you.

**if anyone is to die by the sword, by the sword he must be killed:** These words indicate that God is in control. If God plans for someone *to die by the sword*, then that will happen. Other ways to translate these words are:

> whoever is meant to be killed…will surely be killed (GNT)

> Anyone destined to die by the sword will die by the sword (NLT)

> If God has planned for you to be killed…then you will be killed

**if anyone is to die by the sword:** There is a textual issue here:

1. One of the earliest Greek manuscripts says is to be killed. For example:

    > Anyone destined to die by the sword (NLT) *(BSB, NIV, GNT, NJB, NABRE, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, REB, ESV, NCV)*

2. Some, mostly later Greek manuscripts say kills. For example:

    > if anyone kills with the sword (NASB) *(KJV, RSV, NASB)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because of the similar clause in 13:10a.The UBS Greek NT supports option (1\).

**anyone is to die:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> God plans for someone to kill you by the sword

> God plans for enemies to kill anyone with a sword

**by the sword:** This phrase is an example of purposely killing someone. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate only killing *by the sword* and not any other way of purposely killing someone. If that is true in your language, you may want to indicate that it refers generally to purposely killing someone. For example:

> for example, with the sword

> with a weapon

> purposely

#### 13:10c

**Here is a call for the perseverance and faith of the saints.**

* Here/That is a need for believers to patiently endure and continue in faith.
* So, it is necessary for God’s holy people to persevere and continue believing in him.

**Here is a call for:** Some believers will be captured and other believers will be killed. The phrase indicates that since those things will happen, believers should have patient endurance and remain faithful to Jesus. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> This calls for (NIV)

> This requires (NET)

> In this situation God’s holy people need (GW)

**the perseverance:** This phrase refers to continuing to follow God even though there are hardships or opposition. Other ways to translate it are:

> patient endurance (NIV)

> patience to continue

> endure

See how you translated this phrase in 1:9 or 3:10 (“persevere”).

**faith:** There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as *faith*:

1. It refers to continuing to believe in God. For example:

    > faith (RSV) *(BSB, RSV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NET, ESV, NCV, KJV)*

2. It refers to being true to what one has promised. For example:

    > remain faithful (NLT) *(NIV, NABRE, NLT, CEV, REB)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).Aune (page 751\), Lenski (page 402\), and Kistemaker (page 385\) support interpretation (1\). Other ways to translate this word are:

> believing

> continuing to believe in God/Jesus

**of the saints:** This phrase indicates that *the saints* need to endure and continue to have faith. In some languages it is necessary or more natural to make *the saints* the subject of the sentence. For example:

> the saints must have perseverance and faith (NJB)

**saints:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *saints* means “holy ones.” See how you translated this word in 13:7\.

* **Associated Passages:** REV 13:10

## Revelation 13:11 (id: 523066)

### Section 13:11–18: The second beast rose from the earth

In this section, John saw another beast. This beast rose from the earth. He also had Satan’s authority, as did the first beast. He forced people to worship the first beast. He did miracles and deceived people. He also forced people to have a mark put on their hand or their forehead.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The beast from the earth

> The false prophet that forced people to take the mark of the first beast

#### 13:11a

**Then I saw another beast rising out of the earth.**

* ¶ Then/And I saw another beast rising from the depths of the earth.
* ¶ Then I saw a second monster ascending from under the earth.

**beast:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *beast* refers to any animal, often a wild animal. The BSB uses the word *beast* to imply that this being is evil, fierce, and dangerous. Here the word refers to one of Satan’s servants. See how you translated this word in 13:1\.

**rising out of the earth:** The Greek verb indicates the direction “up.” This beast somehow rose from underneath the surface of the earth. For example:

> which rose out of the earth (RSV)

> ascending from beneath the surface of the earth

#### 13:11b

**This beast had two horns like a lamb, but spoke like a dragon.**

* He had two short horns like a lamb, but he spoke with a dragon’s voice.
* He had two horns like lamb’s horns, but he had the voice like a dragon’s voice.

**This beast had two horns like a lamb:** The beast’s horns probably looked like the horns just beginning to form on an almost fully grown lamb. Scholars have interpreted this clause in many ways. So you should not explain the symbolic meaning in your translation. Many English versions translate it literally. See how you translated *lamb* in 13:8, but do not capitalize the word or phrase here.

**but spoke like a dragon:** This clause probably indicates that the beast spoke fiercely, like the dragon did. He followed the dragon and so said the same kinds of things as the dragon. For example:

> spoke with the voice of a dragon (NLT)

The beast probably spoke *like a dragon* during the whole 42 months. Translate this clause so that it indicates always doing so rather than doing this once.

**dragon:** This word refers to a mythical creature something like a huge lizard. See how you translated this word in 12:3\.

* **Associated Passages:** REV 13:11

## Revelation 13:12 (id: 523068)

### Section 13:11–18: The second beast rose from the earth

In this section, John saw another beast. This beast rose from the earth. He also had Satan’s authority, as did the first beast. He forced people to worship the first beast. He did miracles and deceived people. He also forced people to have a mark put on their hand or their forehead.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The beast from the earth

> The false prophet that forced people to take the mark of the first beast

#### 13:12a

**And this beast exercised all the authority of the first beast**

* He ruled with all the authority of the first beast to benefit him,
* He used every right of the first monster, submitting to him, to rule others.

**And this beast exercised all the authority:** Here the word *exercised* means “used.” The second beast ruled with the same authority that the first beast had. For example:

> The second beast uses all the authority (GW)

The beast probably ruled during the whole 42 months. Translate this clause so that it indicates always doing so rather than doing this once.

**of the first beast:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *of the first beast* is more literally “of the first beast before him.” There are several ways to interpret the phrase “before him.” The main interpretations are:

1. The Greek phrase means in submission to him or for his benefit. The authority of the second beast came from the first beast, and he worked for the first beast. For example:

    > on its behalf (NRSV) *(NIV, NJB, NRSV, CEV, NET)*

2. The Greek phrase means in his presence. The second beast ruled while standing in front of the first beast. For example:

    > stands before (NCV) *(RSV, GNT, NASB, NABRE, GW, REB, NCV, ESV, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because the BDAG supports it.Aune (pages 757–758\) says it is a Semitic idiom that means “by the authority of.”He also says, “the first beast is never referred to in (verses) 11–18 in an active way.”

#### 13:12b

**and caused the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast,**

* and forced all the earth and its people to worship/honor the first beast,
* Using every means on earth, he required every person over the whole earth to revere the first monster.

**caused the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast:** These words indicate that the second beast required people to worship the first beast. If they did not worship it, he would punish them. For example:

> It forced the earth and all who live on it to worship the first beast (GNT)

**the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast:** The phrase *the earth and those who dwell in it* refers to the people of the earth. They will worship the first beast. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> all the earth and its people (NLT)

> all the people of the world worship the first beast and made the things of the world be used for that worship

**worship:** This word refers to honoring someone or something as sacred/divine. Other ways to translate this word are:

> venerate

> revere

See how you translated this word in 13:4\.

#### 13:12c

**whose mortal wound had been healed.**

* the one whose deadly wound had healed.
* The first monster had been wounded to death, but the wound had healed.

**whose mortal wound had been healed:** As 13:3a indicates, one of the first beast’s heads had a fatal wound. But this clause indicates that the wound was healed. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the one who had been wounded to death but healed

> whose deadly injury had healed (NJB)

This tells the reader more about the first beast. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there were other beasts called “the first beast” and only this one had a fatal wound. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about the first beast. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> His mortal wound had been healed

See how you translated a similar clause in 13:3\.

## Revelation 13:13 (id: 523072)

### Section 13:11–18: The second beast rose from the earth

In this section, John saw another beast. This beast rose from the earth. He also had Satan’s authority, as did the first beast. He forced people to worship the first beast. He did miracles and deceived people. He also forced people to have a mark put on their hand or their forehead.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The beast from the earth

> The false prophet that forced people to take the mark of the first beast

#### 13:13a

**And the second beast performed great signs**

* He did great miracles indicating his power,
* And the second monster worked great wonders showing his power,

**performed:** This word means “did” here. For example:

> worked (NJB)

The beast probably did miracles throughout the 42 months. Translate the word so that it indicates “always doing so” rather than “doing this once.”

**great signs:** The BSB literally represents the Greek here. The word *sign* here refers to an unusual event that people regard as having a special meaning. These signs were probably miracles that showed the great power of the dragon and the two beasts. Other ways to translate the Greek phrase are:

> great miracles (NJB)

> great portents

> great wonders (KJV)

The Greek phrase here is the same as in 12:1a. In that verse the BSB has “a great sign.” However, the phrase here is plural. The meaning here probably implies miracles as signs, rather than just *signs* that are seen.

#### 13:13b

**to cause even fire from heaven to come down to earth**

* even, for example, causing fire to descend from very high in the sky to earth
* including the amazing miracle of causing fire to descend from very high in the sky,

**to cause even fire from heaven to come down:** The word *even* indicates that *to cause…fire from heaven to come down* is an example of the great signs (13:13a). For example:

> even, for example, causing fire to come down

> including the amazing miracle of causing fire to descend

> For example, he caused fire to descend

**from heaven…to earth:** Here the word *heaven* means “very high in the sky.” The fire probably began so high in the sky that the people could not see where it began. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> to earth from the sky (NLT)

> from very high in the sky

#### 13:13c

**in the presence of the people.**

* before people.
* and many people saw them.

**in the presence of the people:** The Greek phrase is literally “before men.” This event was done purposely so people could see it. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> in the sight of everyone (GNT)

> while people are watching (NCV)

**the people:** This word is general and refers to both men and women.

## Revelation 13:14 (id: 523073)

### Section 13:11–18: The second beast rose from the earth

In this section, John saw another beast. This beast rose from the earth. He also had Satan’s authority, as did the first beast. He forced people to worship the first beast. He did miracles and deceived people. He also forced people to have a mark put on their hand or their forehead.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The beast from the earth

> The false prophet that forced people to take the mark of the first beast

#### 13:14a–b

The verse labeled 13:14b in the BSB is before 13:14a in the Greek. In some languages it is more natural to follow the Greek order (13:14b before 13:14a). See the General Comment at the end of 13:14b.

#### 13:14a

**Because of the signs it was given to perform on behalf of the first beast,**

* By/Through the miraculous signs he did with the power that was given to him to benefit the first beast,
* He worked wonders to benefit the first monster. The dragon gave to him the power to do them. By doing them,

**Because of:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Because of* indicates that the beast used the signs to deceive the people. For example:

> by (RSV)

> Through (NJB)

> by means of (GNT)

**it was given to perform:** This is literally “which were given to him to do.” This is a passive clause. Some languages must use an active clause. Probably the dragon gave the power. (God allowed the beast to have this power as a part of his plan.) For example:

> the signs which the dragon gave authority to him to do

> the signs which he received power to doIn some languages “take” and “receive” is translated by the same verb. The English verb “receive” implies that someone gave the power, but the English verb “take” does not imply that. Your translation should imply or indicate that someone gave it.

**on behalf of:** Translate this phrase the same way you choose to translate the phrase “before him” in 13:12a (where the BSB translates it as part of the phrase “of the first beast”).

#### 13:14b

**it deceived those who dwell on the earth,**

* he was deceiving the people living on earth.
* he tricked the people of the earth.

**it deceived those who dwell on the earth:** This indicates that the beast caused people to believe lies and do wrong things. The same word occurs at 2:20d. There the BSB translates it as “misleads.” Here it probably indicates that *it deceived* people throughout the 42 months.

**those who dwell on the earth:** This phrase refers to people living on *the earth*. Another way to translate it is:

> the people of the world

##### **General Comment on 13:14a–b**

The BSB has reordered these two clauses. In some languages it is more natural to follow the Greek order. For example:

> 14bHe was deceiving the inhabitants of the earth 14aby the signs which were given to him to perform on behalf of the beast.

> 14bIt fools those who live on earth 14aby the miracles it has been given the power to do. It does these miracles to serve the first beast. (NCV)

#### 13:14c

**telling them to make an image to the beast**

* He commanded them to make/erect a statue
* He told the people to build an image

**telling them to make an image:** The Greek word that the BSB literally translates as *make* means to construct or build the *image*. The word also implies putting the *image* in a public place. For example:

> The beast told them to build an image (GNT)

> He told those who live on the earth to make an image (NET)

**an image:** Here the word *image* refers to a statue that looks like some person or some thing. This statue looked like the first beast:

> a statue (GW)

**to the beast:** The BSB literally represents the Greek here. This phrase indicates that the people honored the beast by making the statue that looked like him:

> for the beast (RSV)

#### 13:14d

**that had been wounded by the sword and yet had lived.**

* to honor the beast who had been wounded with a war machete but still lived.
* of the first monster in order to honor it. This was the monster who was fatally wounded by a fighting knife and yet lived. They did as he said.

**that had been wounded by the sword:** This refers to the wound mentioned in 13:3a. It is not a new wound. This clause is passive. Some languages must use another kind of clause. For example:

> whom someone wounded with the sword

> who had the wound of the sword (NASB)

> who had a/the/that deep cut from a sword

**sword:** A *sword* is a sharp hand\-held weapon that cuts or stabs. The swords of that time were 60–120 centimeters (2–4 feet) long and made of metal. See how you translated this word in 1:16 or 6:4\.

##### **General Comment on 13:14c–d**

It is strongly implied that the people made the statue as the second beast told them to (13:14c). In some languages it is more natural to include this implied information at the end of 13:14d. For example:

> …and yet lived. And they did so.

* **Associated Passages:** REV 13:14

## Revelation 13:15 (id: 523074)

### Section 13:11–18: The second beast rose from the earth

In this section, John saw another beast. This beast rose from the earth. He also had Satan’s authority, as did the first beast. He forced people to worship the first beast. He did miracles and deceived people. He also forced people to have a mark put on their hand or their forehead.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The beast from the earth

> The false prophet that forced people to take the mark of the first beast

#### 13:15a

**The second beast was permitted to give breath to the image of the first beast,**

* He was given power to cause the image/statue of the first beast to breathe,
* The dragon gave power to the second monster to give life to the image of the first monster,

**The second beast was permitted:** This clause is passive. Some ways to translate it are:

* Use a passive clause. For example:

    > Permission was given to him

    > it was allowed (RSV)

* Use an active clause. Probably the dragon or the first beast gave the permission. (God allowed the second beast to have the power as a part of his plan.) For example:

    > the dragon gave power to him

* Use a verb that implies that someone gave permission to him. For example:

    > he received permissionIn some languages “take” and “receive” is translated by the same verb. The English verb “receive” implies that someone gave the power, but the English verb “take” does not imply that. Your translation should imply or indicate that someone gave it.

**to give breath to the image of the first beast:** These words probably refer to causing the statue to move and speak by some means, which John does not tell us.Beale (page 711\) refers to fake magical tricks, “including ventriloquism, false lighting and other such phenomenon.” Kistemaker (page 392\) says, “(It) implies animation achieved by magic…a parody of God giving life to Adam.” Osbourne (page 515\) says, “(It) is not just false trickery…but is most like (the breath) given to the two witnesses when they were raised from the dead in 11\.11\.” Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> put breath into the idol, so that it could speak (CEV)

> breathe life into the image (GNT)

> give life to the image (NET)

#### 13:15b

**so that the image could speak**

* so that it was able to speak
* causing it to speak.

**so that the image could speak:** This phrase implies that the image spoke. In some languages a literal translation would not imply that the statue actually spoke. If that is true in your language, indicate that it did speak. For example:

> so that it spoke

#### 13:15c

**and cause all who refused to worship it to be killed.**

* and order/command all who refused to worship/honor it to be killed.
* The image required/ordered someone to kill everyone who refused to revere it.

**and cause all who refused to worship it to be killed:** There are two ways to interpret the Greek words here:

1. The image caused those who refused to worship it to be killed. For example:

    > Then the statue commanded that anyone refusing to worship it must die. (NLT) *(BSB, NIV, GNT, NRSV, NASB, NABRE, NLT, GW, NET, REB, ESV, KJV)*

2. The beast caused those who refused to worship the image to be killed. For example:

    > And the second beast was given power to command all who will not worship the image of the beast to be killed. (NCV) *(RSV, NJB, NCV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because the Greek form of the two verbs “speak” and “cause” indicate that they are parts of one purpose statement for what the image will do. That purpose statement starts with “so that” in 13:15b.Swete (page 172\), Lenski (page 409\), and Osbourne (page 516\) support interpretation (1\). But Beale (age 711\) supports interpretation (2\). Aune (page 765\) states both interpretations but does not choose which he prefers.

**cause all who refused to worship it to be killed:** The clause *be killed* is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> cause someone to kill all who refused to worship the image

> order someone to kill all who refused to worship the image, and that person did so

### Section 13:11–18: The second beast rose from the earth

In this section, John saw another beast. This beast rose from the earth. He also had Satan’s authority, as did the first beast. He forced people to worship the first beast. He did miracles and deceived people. He also forced people to have a mark put on their hand or their forehead.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The beast from the earth

> The false prophet that forced people to take the mark of the first beast

#### 13:16a

**And the second beast required all people**

* He also made everyone,
* The second monster required/compelled all people,

**And the second beast:** The Greek is literally “And he.” The pronoun refers to the second beast, as the BSB makes explicit.

**required all people:** This phrase indicates that the second beast required people to receive the mark. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> causes all (RSV)

> compelled everyone (NJB)

#### 13:16b

**small and great, rich and poor, free and slave,**

* both unimportant and important people, both rich and poor people, both free people and slaves,
* whether they were powerful or humble/lowly, whether they were wealthy or poor, whether they were free to rule their own lives or were under a master,

**small and great, rich and poor, free and slave:** This list emphasizes the fact that everyone was required to receive the mark. Other ways to translate these phrases are:

> everyone, regardless of name, wealth, or social status

> everyone, including famous people and unknown people, wealthy people and poor people, independent workers and slaves

**small and great:** This phrase refers to people of both low status and high status. It implies people of all classes and positions in society. The phrase does not refer to physical size.

In some languages it is more natural to list the high status people first. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> humble and great/famous

> both of high and lowly position/place

> whether they are important people or not

See how you translated this phrase in 11:18, but note that here the phrase refers to the people of the world, not believers.

**free:** The word *free* refers to people who are not slaves. A *free* person can work in exchange for money for anyone who hires him. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> those who stand free

> those who rule their own lives

See how you translated this word in 6:15\.

**slave:** A *slave* is a person who belongs to a master. A slave has to obey his master. He is not free to leave and work elsewhere. Other ways to translate this word are:

> forced laborers

> those subjected to a master

See how you translated this word in 6:15\.

#### 13:16c

**to receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead,**

* to be given a mark/stamp on his right hand or on his forehead,
* to take a sign/symbol on either his right hand or on his forehead.

**mark:** This word refers to any kind of sign or symbol that is easily seen. These verses do not say what exactly the mark is or how it was placed on the hand or forehead.

##### **General Comment on 13:16a–c**

The added information that explains “everyone” interrupts the sentence. In some languages it is more natural to have the added information at the end of the verse. For example:

> 16aHe also forced everyone 16cto receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, 16bthis included small and great, rich and poor, free and slave,

> 16aHe also forced everyone 16cto receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead. 16bAbsolutely everyone was included: small and great, rich and poor, free and slave.

#### 13:17a

**so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark—**

* so that no one could buy or sell without that mark,
* If anyone did not have the mark, he could not buy or sell anything.

#### 13:17b

**the name of the beast or the number of its name.**

* which is the name of the beast or the number that represents his name.
* The mark is the name of the first monster or the number that is the sign/symbol of his name.
* It is either the name of the first monster or the number that symbolizes his name.

#### 13:17a–b

**the name of the beast or the number of its name:** There is a textual issue in 13:17b: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the text the name of the beast or the number of his name. These words explain “the mark” in 13:17a (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some, mostly later Greek manuscripts have the text or the name of the beast or the number of his name (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. The BSB uses a long dash after 13:17a to indicate that 13:17b explains that the mark was the beast’s *name* or *the number of its name*. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other marks that John was thinking of and only this one was the beast’s *name* or *the number of its name*. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about this mark. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> It is the name of the beast or the number of his name.

**the name of the beast:** This phrase refers to name of the first beast.

**the number of its name:** There are many ways to interpret this phrase. Some possibilities are:

1. It indicates that the number in 13:18d is strictly symbolic. For example, three sixes may refer to three beings, namely, the dragon and the two beasts. They always fall short of God and perfection, often represented by the number seven.Beale (page 722–725\) and others explore this.
2. Add up the numbers of the beast’s name based on a numbering system using the Greek or Hebrew alphabet. The total would be 666\.Aune (page 770\) and others explore this.
3. Each number represents a Greek letter (“Α” \= 1, “Β” \= 2, and so forth). One possible solution for “666” would be “ZZZ” in the Greek alphabet. This would be the initials of the beast’s name.Swete (page 175\) speaks of a large number of conjectures.

You should translate this phrase so that it allows these interpretations. For example:

> the number that stands for the name (GNT)

* **Associated Passages:** REV 13:17

## Revelation 13:18 (id: 523081)

### Section 13:11–18: The second beast rose from the earth

In this section, John saw another beast. This beast rose from the earth. He also had Satan’s authority, as did the first beast. He forced people to worship the first beast. He did miracles and deceived people. He also forced people to have a mark put on their hand or their forehead.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The beast from the earth

> The false prophet that forced people to take the mark of the first beast

#### 13:18a

**Here is a call for wisdom:**

* ¶ Wisdom is needed to understand this.
* ¶ This topic/issue/matter requires wisdom.

**Here is a call for wisdom:** The Greek clause is literally “Here is wisdom” (as in the KJV and NASB). The Greek clause urges readers to be wise regarding interpreting the meaning of the number. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> Wisdom is needed here (NLT)

> This takes wisdom (NCV)

**wisdom:** The word *wisdom* means “be able to understand events and know what should be done.”

In some languages it is more natural to translate *wisdom* as a phrase. For example:

> wise words

> right and just thinking

See how you translated this word in 5:12 or 7:12\.

#### 13:18b

**Let the one who has insight calculate the number of the beast,**

* The one who is wise should know what the number of the beast is,
* Let the person/one who is smart figure out what the number of the monster is,

**Let the one who has insight:** The Greek clause is literally “The (person) having understanding.” The clause is addressed to anyone who can understand things easily or learn quickly. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> him who has understanding (NASB)

> Whoever is intelligent (GNT)

> Any smart person

> if you are smart enough (CEV)

**calculate the number of the beast:** This command can mean either:

1. Use math to relate the name to the number.
2. Discern carefully the relationship between the name and the number.

If possible, translate this command so that it allows both meanings. Other ways to translate it are:

> figure out the meaning of the number of the beast (GNT)

> interpret the number of the beast (NJB)

#### 13:18c

**for it is the number of a man,**

* for it is a number of a man.
* because it is the number symbolizing the name of a human being.

**for:** This word indicates that 13:18c explains “the number of the beast” in 13:18b.

**it is the number of a man:** There are several ways to interpret this clause. The main interpretations are:

1. It refers to a particular man. For example:

    > the number stands for the name of someone (GNT) *(BSB, GNT, NJB, NIV11, NRSV, NASB, NABRE, NLT, CEV, REB, NCV, ESV, KJV)*

2. It refers to mankind in general. For example:

    > it is a human number (RSV) *(RSV, NIV84, GW, NET)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because the beast is represented as an individual rather than as a characteristic of mankind.Osbourne (page 520\) says, “(It) is probably not generic, since that would simply mean it was open to human understanding or, with Beale (1999: 723–24\), would mean ‘for it is the number of humanity.’ But in that sense the beast would simply be the sum of human depravity; and…the NT evidence for an actual Antichrist figure appearing in human history is too strong.”

#### 13:18d

**and that number is 666\.**

* His/Its number is six hundred sixty\-six.
* The monster’s number is 666\.

**666:** The Greek phrase is literally “six hundred sixty\-six.” Numerals (1,2,3…) were not used in Greek at that time. Translate this number using either numerals or number words.

Some languages do not have large number words such as “hundred.” If that is true in your language, you may want to use the number from the major language. You may use numerals such as *666* or number words such as “six hundred sixty\-six.”

## Revelation 14:1 (id: 523082)

### Section 14:1–5: The 144,000 men/believers sang a new song

In this section, John saw Jesus with 144,000 men (this group may represent all believers) who dedicated their whole lives to following him. John heard them sing a new song.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> John saw the Lamb with 144,000 men/believers

> The one hundred and forty\-four thousand men/people who followed the Lamb completely sing a new song

#### 14:1a

**Then I looked and saw the Lamb standing on Mount Zion,**

* ¶ Then I looked, and look/hey, I saw the Lamb standing on Mount Zion,
* ¶ Then I looked around and suddenly saw the Lamb standing on Mount Zion.

**Then I looked:** John had just finished talking about the second beast. This clause indicates that he saw a new part of the vision. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> I looked again (JBP)

> Next in my vision I saw (NJB)

**and saw the Lamb:** The Greek words are literally “and look, the Lamb.” The word “look” emphasizes or calls attention to the words that follow. The word is not a command to look at something. Other ways to translate these words are:

> and indeed/hey, the Lamb

> and suddenly/unexpectedly I saw the Lamb

**the Lamb:** This is a title for Jesus. Jewish people killed a lamb at the Passover as a sacrifice to God. The lamb has symbolic meaning as a special sacrifice and is a symbol for the Christ. See how you translated this title in 5:6 or 13:8\.

**Mount Zion:** *Zion* is the name of the hill in Jerusalem southwest of the temple. In the Old Testament, *Mount Zion* was symbolic of God’s holy city, Jerusalem. Here also, the name *Mount Zion* probably represents Jerusalem.

In some languages people do not know where Mount Zion is. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain it in a footnote. For example:

    > Mount Zion is a hill in the city of Jerusalem. It is a symbol for God’s holy city, Jerusalem.

* Explain it in your translation. For example:

    > Mount Zion in God’s holy city

    > Mount Zion in Jerusalem

**Zion:** This name is Greek is spelled *Siōn*.

#### 14:1b

**and with Him 144,000**

* and with him were 144,000 men/people/believers
* One hundred forty\-four thousand men/people/believers were with him.

**144,000:** The Greek phrase uses number words: “one hundred forty\-four thousands.” Some languages do not have large number words such as “thousand.” If that is true in your language, you may want to use the number from the major language. This may be numerals such as *144,000* or number words such as “one hundred forty\-four thousand.” See how you translated this number in 7:4\.

This number may refer to the number of men that John saw (14:4a). In some languages it is more natural to include the noun “men” with the number. For example:

> 144,000 men

However, some scholars think that the 144,000 refers to both men and women. They interpret 14:4a as referring to both men and women sincerely following Jesus. For example:

> 144,000 people (GW)

#### 14:1c

**who had His name and His Father’s name written on their foreheads.**

* who had his name and his Father’s name on their foreheads.
* They had on their foreheads both his name and his Father’s name.

**who had His name and His Father’s name written on their foreheads:** There is a textual issue in 14:1c: (1\) The earliest Greek manuscripts have the text his name and his father’s name (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some later Greek manuscripts have the text his father’s name (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. This clause tells the reader more about the 144,000 men/believers. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other groups of 144,000 men/believers, and only this group had these names *written on their foreheads*. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about the 144,000\. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> They had his name and his Father’s name written on their foreheads.

**who had His name and His Father’s name written:** The clause is passive. Some languages must use an active or intransitive clause. For example:

> who had his name and his Father’s name which angels/someone wrote

> upon whose foreheads was his name and his Father’s name

If you translate this second example, it should imply that someone wrote the name.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> John saw the Lamb with 144,000 men/believers

> The one hundred and forty\-four thousand men/people who followed the Lamb completely sing a new song

#### 14:2a–c

John described the sound he heard in three ways. The first two ways indicate that it was loud. The third way indicates that it was music. The third way probably implies that the music was beautiful.

#### 14:2a

**And I heard a sound from heaven**

* Then I heard a sound from heaven

**heaven:** The word *heaven* refers here to the place where God lives.

#### 14:2b

**like the roar of many waters and the loud rumbling of thunder.**

* like a lot of water over rapids and like loud thunder.
* It was as loud as waterfalls. It was as loud as thunder.

**the roar of many waters:** The Greek phrase is literally “the sound of many waters” (as in the RSV). The phrase refers to the sound of a lot of water moving rapidly. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> a roaring waterfall (GNT)

> the roar of mighty ocean waves (NLT)

See how you translated the same Greek phrase in 1:15 (BSB: “the roar of many waters”).

**the loud rumbling of thunder:** This phrase refers to loud thunder. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the sound of loud thunder (RSV)

> the roar of thunder (NJB)

#### 14:2c

**And the sound I heard was like harpists strumming their harps.**

* The sound I heard was like harpists/musicians playing their harps.
* It sounded as beautiful as people playing stringed instruments.

**harpists strumming their harps:** The word *harpists* refers to people who play harps. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> musicians playing their harps (GNT)

> people playing harps (NCV)

**harps:** A harp is a stringed instrument. It makes beautiful sounds. People play it by plucking its strings with their fingers. There were several types of harps. Two examples are shown below:

In some languages people are not familiar with harps. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use the word for *harps* from the major language. If this word is unfamiliar, you may then want to explain what a harp is in a footnote. For example:

    > A harp is a stringed instrument.

* Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > stringed instruments

* Use a descriptive phrase along with its name. In some languages other stringed instruments (such as guitars) are known but harps are not. For example:

    > stringed instruments called harps

See how you translated this word in 5:8\.

In this section, John saw Jesus with 144,000 men (this group may represent all believers) who dedicated their whole lives to following him. John heard them sing a new song.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> John saw the Lamb with 144,000 men/believers

#### 14:3a

**And they sang a new song before the throne**

* And they were singing a new song before the throne
* They were singing a new song before God’s place/seat of ruling

**they sang a new song:** There is a textual issue in 14:3a: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the text a new song (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some other early Greek manuscripts have the text as it were a new song (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because many English versions support it. The UBS Greek NT supports option (2\), but says its scholars had difficulty deciding. The pronoun *they* probably refers to the 144,000 men/believers (14:1b).

**sang:** The Greek grammar probably indicates that they sang for some time. For example:

> were singing (NJB)

**before the throne:** This phrase refers to God’s throne in heaven. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer to a different throne. If that is true in your language, you may want to include the implied information. For example:

> before the throne in heaven

> before God’s throne

#### 14:3b

**and before the four living creatures and the elders.**

* and before the four living beings and before the elders/leaders.
* and in the presence of the four living beings and the twenty\-four elders/leaders.

**living creatures:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *living creatures* is literally “living (ones).” The word refers to beings that are like angels. The *living creatures* speak and praise God (4:8\). Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> living beings (NLT)

> living things/ones

See how you translated this phrase in 4:6\.

**elders:** Here the word *elders* refers to those who have authority. These people (or angels) were leaders who had God as their leader. For example:

> leaders (GW)

These verses do not say whether the elders were people or angels. So you should use a word like “elder” or “leader” that can refer to either people or angels.

There were twenty\-four elders. They are not included in the count of “four.”

See how you translated this word in 4:4\.

#### 14:3c

**And no one could learn the song except the 144,000**

* No one could learn this song except the 144,000 men/believers
* Only the 144,000 men/believers could learn this song.

**And no one could learn the song except the 144,000:** This clause indicates that only the 144,000 men/believers could learn this song. Another way to translate this clause is:

> Only the 144,000 men/believers could learn this song

#### 14:3d

**who had been redeemed from the earth.**

* who were bought from the world.
* God had redeemed them from among those of the world.

**who had been redeemed from the earth:** This clause tells the reader more about the 144,000 men/believers. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other groups of 144,000 and only this group could learn this song. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about the 144,000\. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> They had been redeemed from the earth.

**who had been redeemed:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> whom God has redeemed from the earth

**redeemed:** God paid a price to receive the 144,000\. That price was the death of his Son. Other ways to translate this word are:

> purchased from the earth (NASB)

> ransomed from the earth (REB)

**from the earth:** This phrase probably indicates that God had purchased these men/people from all over the earth. They were purchased from the world and separated from it in some way. It probably does not refer to God removing them from the earth.Mounce (page 266\) says, “That they have been redeemed from the earth does not mean that they were removed bodily from the earth (cf. John 17:15\).” Swete (page 178\) says that it does not indicate separation. Smalley (page 357\) argues against it meaning removal from the earth.

#### 14:4a

**These are the ones who have not been defiled with women,**

* These men have not dishonored themselves sexually with women,
* They are the men who have kept themselves pure by not having sexual relations with women, (GNT)
* They have not defiled themselves in the eyes of God in any way,

**These are the ones who have not been defiled with women:** This clause refers to men who have never had sexual relations with women. The word *defiled* is probably used in the sense of having become “ceremonially unclean.” A Jewish person could not go and worship God until the next sunset after he or she had sexual relations (Leviticus 15:18\). Other ways to translate this clause are:

> These men have not dishonored themselves with women

> They are the men who have kept themselves pure by not having sexual relations with women (GNT)

This clause may refer figuratively to all believers being pure in God’s eyes. For example:

> They have kept themselves as pure (NLT)

But many English versions translate literally and allow the reader to decide whether to understand this clause literally or figuratively.

#### 14:4b

**for they are virgins.**

* because they were male\-virgins.
* for they are celibate/chaste.
* for they have not pursued any ungodly thing.

**for:** This conjunction introduces an explanation of 14:4a.

**they are virgins:** The word *virgins* is masculine. It refers to men who have never had sexual relations. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> they kept themselves pure (NIV84\)

> they are celibate

> they have not lain with women

This clause may refer figuratively to all believers being pure in God’s eyes. For example:

> as virgins (NLT)

But many English versions translate literally and allow the reader to decide whether to understand this clause literally or figuratively.

#### 14:4c

**They follow the Lamb wherever He goes.**

* They follow the Lamb wherever he goes/leads.
* They always follow/obey the Lamb’s commands.

**They follow the Lamb wherever He goes:** This clause refers figuratively to obeying Jesus as their master or leader. These men/believers always did as Jesus commanded them. For example:

> they follow the Lamb wherever he leads (CEV)

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that these men/believers physically walked behind Jesus wherever he went. If that is true in your language, you should translate the figurative meaning. For example:

> They have not separated from the Lamb wherever he goes

> They obey everything that the Lamb tells them

#### 14:4d

**They have been redeemed from among men**

* They were bought from mankind
* God had purchased them from among other people

**They have been redeemed from among men:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> God has purchased them from among men

**redeemed:** This verb is the same Greek verb as in 14:3d. There the BSB translated it as “redeemed.” It probably means “redeemed” here as well. Translate it as you did in 14:3\.

**from among men:** The Greek phrase is literally “from people.” It probably has the same or similar meaning as “from the earth” (14:3b).

#### 14:4e

**as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.**

* to be an offering of the first part of the harvest to God and the Lamb,
* to belong to him and to the Lamb, like the first part of harvested food belongs to God.

**as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb:** This phrase describes the men/believers whom God purchased. Other ways to translate these words are:

> as first fruits for God and the Lamb (NRSV)

> to be the first–fruits for God and for the Lamb (NJB)

**as firstfruits:** This phrase is a metaphor. In the Jewish society the first part of the harvest was given to God (Exodus 23:19, Leviticus 23:9–14\). This offering was called *firstfruits*.

Here the 144,000 men/believers are like the first part of the harvest. They are set aside for God to use. In some languages it is more natural to translate this as a simile. For example:

> like an offering of the first part of the harvest

> just as the first part of the harvest is offered

> like the/a harvest offering

If you have translated James 1:18, see how you translated “firstfruits” there.

#### 14:5a

**And no lie was found in their mouths;**

* and no lie was found on their lips; (NET)
* They told no lies.

**And no lie was found in their mouths:** This is a Hebrew idiom that means “They did not tell lies.” For example:

> They never tell lies (CEV)

#### 14:5b

**they are blameless.**

* indeed, they are without fault.
* Yes/Certainly, they are blameless.

There is no conjunction between 14:5a and 14:5b. Here this grammar probably indicates that 14:5b is a more general statement than 14:5a but with a similar meaning. The repetition emphasizes the shared meaning. Some languages use other words to emphasize the meaning. For example:

> indeed,…

> for certain…

**they are blameless:** There is a textual issue in 14:5b: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the text they are blameless (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) A few late Greek manuscripts have the text they are blameless before the throne of God (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. This clause indicates that the behavior of the 144,000 was without fault. Other ways to translate this word are:

The second angel announced that God would destroy Babylon. The third angel announced that God would punish those who followed the beast. The fourth speaker encouraged believers who would die before Jesus returned.

Other examples for this section heading are:

> Four announcements were spoken

> Angels spoke four messages

#### 14:6a

**Then I saw another angel flying overhead,**

* ¶ Then I saw another angel flying in the sky,

**flying overhead:** The word *overhead* probably refers to being neither high in the sky nor close to the ground. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> across the sky (CEV)

> overhead (GW)

#### 14:6b

**with the eternal gospel**

* and he had some good news that would last forever
* and he had an eternal message

**with the eternal gospel:** The Greek words are literally “having an eternal gospel.” There are two ways to interpret it:

1. It refers to a message: some good news. The good news is told in 14:7\. For example:

    > with an eternal gospel (RSV) *(RSV, NASB, NABRE, NET, REB, ESV)*

2. It refers to the gospel of Jesus Christ. The message of the angel in 14:7 supports the full gospel mentioned here. For example:

    > with an eternal message of Good News (GNT) *(BSB, NIV, GNT, NJB, NLT, GW, CEV, NCV, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because many commentators support it.Aune (page 825\) indicates that form of the verb “proclaim” in 14:6c also helps to indicate that the Greek word means “message” and not “gospel” here. This is the only place in the Greek New Testament where “gospel/good\-news” occurs without “the” in front of it.One exception is Romans 1:1, where it is “God’s gospel,” so it does not need “the” in front. The other exception is 2 Corinthians 11:4, where it is “a different gospel,” and also does not need “the” in front. The angel states the message in 14:7b–e. Other ways to translate this clause according to interpretation (1\) are:

> having an eternal message of good news

> with the following good message for all time

**with:** This angel flew *with* this gospel because God had given it to him to tell. Now he was ready to tell it to others. Another way to translate this phrase is:

> he bore/carried

**eternal:** The word *eternal* indicates that the message will not be changed. Believers should always fear God, glorify him, and worship him (14:7b–d). For example:

> everlasting (GW)

#### 14:6c

**to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth—**

* to announce to all people living on the earth,

**proclaim:** This word refers to speaking loudly so that everyone could hear. For example:

> announce (GNT)

**those who dwell on the earth:** The Greek phrase is literally “the (ones) sitting on the earth.” This phrase refers to people living on earth. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> those on earth (REB)

> the peoples of the earth (GNT)

#### 14:6d

**to every nation and tribe and tongue and people.**

* namely, to every nation, tribe/clan, language, and people/land.
* that is, to every country, every tribe, every language, and every people\-group.

**to every nation and tribe and tongue and people:** The Greek words are literally “even/and to every nation, tribe, language, and people.” This phrase explains “those who live on the earth” in 14:6c. The BSB indicates that it is an explanation by using a long dash at the end of 14:6c. The phrase does not refer to a different group than 14:6c. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> namely, to every nation, tribe, language, and people

> that is, to every nation, tribe, language, and people

**every nation and tribe and tongue and people:** The word *every* applies to each of the four kinds of groups. For example:

> every tribe, every language, every people, and every nation

See how you translated this phrase in 5:9 or 13:7\. But note that the order of the groups is different here.

**And he said:** The Greek word is literally “saying” (as in the KJV). This word probably indicates that the angel’s message follows in 14:7b–e.

#### 14:7b

**“Fear God and give Him glory,**

* “Fear and respect/revere God and glorify him,
* “Be in awe of God and acknowledge his glory/splendor,

**Fear God:** Here the word *Fear* means “respect” or “revere.” People who *Fear* God are humble before God and are in awe of him. They also realize he is all\-powerful and does as he chooses. So they respect and honor him.

In some languages the word *Fear* only means “be afraid of.” If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Include the meaning of “respect” or “revere.” For example:

    > Fear and respect/revere God

* Translate the meaning of *Fear* as “respect,” “honor,” or “revere.” For example:

    > Honor God (GNT)

**give Him glory:** This is a command to agree that God has glory. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> acknowledge his majesty

> praise his greatness (GNT)

> say that he is great/glorious

> honor God (CEV)

See how you translated a similar phrase “give glory” in 4:9 or 11:13\.

#### 14:7c

**because the hour of His judgment has come.**

* because the hour/time has come for him to judge.
* because this/now is the time for him to judge all people.

**the hour of His judgment has come:** This clause indicates that the time for God to judge people is now. This time is when God would judge people.

In some languages it is more natural to use wording other than *has come* here. For example:

> the hour of his judgment is now

> It has become the hour of his judgment

**the hour:** Here the word *hour* refers generally to the time when God begins to judge people. For example:

> the time (GNT)

**His judgment:** This phrase refers to God deciding whether someone is guilty or innocent of wrongdoing. For example:

> for God to judge all people (NCV)

#### 14:7d

**Worship the One**

* Worship/Honor him
* Revere/Respect him!

**Worship:** This word refers to honoring someone or something as sacred/divine. Other ways to translate this word are:

> Venerate

> Revere

See how you translated this word in 13:4 or 13:12\.

#### 14:7e

**who made the heavens and the earth and the sea and the springs of waters.”**

* who created the heavens and the earth, the ocean, and the springs/sources of water.”
* He is the one who made/created the land and the sky, the seas, and the springs.”

**the heavens:** The Greek word that the BSB translates with the plural word *heavens* is literally “the heaven.” It includes the sky, outer space, and the stars.

**sea:** The word *sea* refers to a large body of water. A *sea* is often so large that someone standing on one side cannot see the other side. Here the word *sea* refers to seas and oceans in general. Some languages do not have a word or phrase for *sea*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > all the large bodies of water

    > saltwater

* Use the major language word.

See how you translated this word in 5:13 or 13:1\.

**springs of waters:** This phrase refers to places where water arises out of the ground. In some languages it is more natural to omit the phrase *of water*.

### Section 14:6–13: John heard four messages

In this section, John heard three messages from three angels and one message from someone in heaven. The first angel told everyone to honor God. The second angel announced that God would destroy Babylon. The third angel announced that God would punish those who followed the beast. The fourth speaker encouraged believers who would die before Jesus returned.

Other examples for this section heading are:

> Four announcements were spoken

> Angels spoke four messages

#### 14:8a

**Then a second angel followed, saying,**

* ¶ Then/Next a second angel came and said,
* ¶ After the first angel, another angel appeared and said,

**Then a second angel followed:** Here the word *Then…followed* refers to appearing next. In this case, it indicates that the second angel came after the first angel. The word probably implies that the first angel had left. Then the second angel came to the same place where the first angel made his announcement. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> A second angel came afterward

> Then a second angel came there

**second:** The word *second* refers to the next item after the first one. If counted, this item would be counted as number two. Other ways to translate this word are:

> the one after the first

> another

See how you translated this word in 4:7 or 11:14\.

#### 14:8b

**“Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great,**

* “The great Babylon has fallen, indeed, she/it has fallen,
* “The great city of Babylon is in ruins, complete ruins!

**Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great:** The Greek words are literally “The great Babylon fell fell.” The verb “fell” is repeated to emphasize its meaning. The BSB puts the verb first in an English poetic style. Some other ways to emphasize the meaning are:

> She has fallen! Great Babylon has fallen! (GNT)The pronoun “She” refers to Babylon here.

> Babylon the Great has fallen; she/it has fallen indeed!

**Fallen:** Here the word *Fallen* refers to God destroying the city (18:20\).For the Greek word translated “fallen”: L\&N: “(d) to suffer or experience destruction”; BDAG: “(2\) to experience loss of status or condition, *fall, be destroyed…***Rv 14:8**.” Your translation should imply that the city fell because it was destroyed.

In some languages the word *Fallen* here does not imply being destroyed. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > has been destroyed and so has fallen

* Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:

    > has been destroyed

    > is finished/gone

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. For example:

    > The word “fallen” refers to God destroying the city (18:20\).

**Babylon the great:** The city *Babylon* is called *great* because it refers to a city of this time that had a vast empire and great influence. For example:

> Great Babylon (GNT)

> the famous Babylon

**Babylon:** This name is probably a symbol of those who oppose God. The king of *Babylon* conquered Jerusalem about 600 years before Jesus was on earth. The city was well\-known for idol worship. It had a vast empire at that time. But at the time of Jesus and John, *Babylon* had only a few people living there.BDAG (page 162\). So it is a symbol here. It may refer to Rome as in John’s time, or it may refer to a future powerful city. You should use the name *Babylon* here.

#### 14:8c

**who has made all the nations drink the wine of the passion of her immorality.”**

* who/which forced all nations to drink the wine of her passionate adulteries.”
* She/It caused all nations to share/participate in her/its passionate unfaithfulness to God.”

14:8c contains metaphors of drinking wine and adultery. They refer to people of the nations participating with Babylon in evil deeds. In the Old Testament God often refers figuratively to such evil deeds as adultery, because the people doing them are seeking things other than God.

**who has made all the nations drink the wine of the passion of her immorality:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *passion* can mean “sexual desire,” “anger,” or even “insanity.” There are several ways to interpret it here. The main interpretations are:

1. It means strong sexual desire. For example:

    > She made all peoples drink her wine—the strong wine of her immoral lust (GNT) *(BSB, RSV, GNT, NASB, NABRE, NLT, GW, NET, ESV)*

2. It means anger. It refers to God’s anger with Babylon. For example:

    > She has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication (NRSV) *(NRSV, CEV, REB, NCV, KJV)*

3. It means cause to be insane or make angry. This is the meaning of “maddening” in the NIV. *(NIV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).Beale (page 756\) says the word refers to passion and not anger here (similarly Aune (page 831\) and Lenski (page 433\)). The word should then be understood as describing the adulteries: they were passionate or lustful. People desired to participate in the adulteries. For example:

> She who made all nations drink the wine of her passionate unfaithfulness (JBP)

**drink the wine:** Here this phrase refers figuratively to doing something. The nations participated with Babylon in her adulteries.

In some languages the meaning of the metaphor is not clear. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning of the metaphor in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Here the phrase “drink the wine” is a metaphor for doing something. The nations participated with Babylon in her adulteries.

* Translate the meaning without the metaphor. For example:

    > participate in the bad deeds *You may then want to give the literal words in a footnote. An example footnote is:*

    > Literally: “drink the wine.”

**wine:** Wine is made from the juice of grapes, a fruit that grows on a vine. The grape juice is allowed to ferment, so *wine* is an alcoholic beverage. If people drink a lot of it, they become drunk. Here the word *wine* refers figuratively to Babylon’s evil ways.

In some languages people are not familiar with *wine*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > alcoholic beverage of wine

* Use the common alcoholic beverage in your area. You may then use a footnote to explain the literal word. For example:

    > Literally: “wine.” Wine is an alcoholic beverage made from grapes.

* Use the word from the major language. If the word is not well known, you may want to explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Wine is an alcoholic beverage made from grapes. Here the word “wine” refers figuratively to the bad ways of Babylon that the nations followed.

See how you translated this word in 6:6\.

**immorality:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *immorality* refers to sexual relations with someone to whom a person is not married. Other ways to translate this word are:

> adulteries (NIV)

> fornication (NRSV)

The word here refers figuratively to doing things that are immoral. Here it may refer to worshiping someone other than God, committing sexually immoral deeds, enticing people to sin, or misusing authority.

In some languages a literal translation will wrongly refer only to adultery. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning of the metaphor in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Here the word “adultery” is a metaphor for doing things that are immoral. It may refer to worshiping someone other than God, doing sexually immoral deeds, enticing people to sin, or misusing authority.

* Translate the meaning without the metaphor. For example:

    > immoral deeds *You may then want to give the literal word in a footnote. An example footnote is:*

    > Literally: “adultery.”

### Section 14:6–13: John heard four messages

In this section, John heard three messages from three angels and one message from someone in heaven. The first angel told everyone to honor God. The second angel announced that God would destroy Babylon. The third angel announced that God would punish those who followed the beast. The fourth speaker encouraged believers who would die before Jesus returned.

Other examples for this section heading are:

> Four announcements were spoken

> Angels spoke four messages

#### 14:9a

**And a third angel followed them, calling out in a loud voice,**

* ¶ Then/Next a third angel came and said loudly,
* ¶ After the second angel, another angel appeared and shouted,

**third:** This refers to the next item after the second one. If counted, this item would be counted as number three. See how you translated this word in 4:7 or 11:14\.

**followed:** As in 14:8a, the word *followed* here refers to appearing in sequence. Translate this word as you did in 14:8\.

**them:** This pronoun refers to the first two angels.

#### 14:9b

**“If anyone worships the beast and its image,**

* “If anyone worships/reveres the beast and his image/statue
* “All who worship/honor the monster and his image/statue

**If anyone worships the beast:** This if\-clause is used to introduce a warning of what would happen when someone *worships the beast*. It does not indicate any doubt about whether anyone will worship the beast.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that possibly no one would worship the beast. If that is true in your language, indicate that some people will worship the beast. For example:

> As for those who worship the beast…, they, too, will drink…

> This will happen to those who worship the beast…, they, too, will drink…

**beast:** This word refers to the first beast. See how you translated *beast* in 13:1 or 13:18\.

**its image:** This word refers to the statue of the first beast. See how you translated *image* in 13:14\.

#### 14:9c

**and receives its mark on his forehead or on his hand,**

* and accepts/takes a mark/stamp on his forehead or on his hand,
* and allows someone to put the beast’s sign/symbol on their forehead or hand,

**and receives its mark on his forehead or on his hand:** See how you translated the similar words “receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead” in 13:16\. Translate these words in a similar way, but note the differences here.

**its mark:** The BSB adds the word *its*. This word makes it clear that the *mark* is the mark of the beast. For example:

> the mark of the beast (CEV)

However, in some languages following the Greek words will clearly refer to the mark of the beast. For example:

> a mark (RSV)

* **Associated Passages:** REV 14:9

### Section 14:6–13: John heard four messages

In this section, John heard three messages from three angels and one message from someone in heaven. The first angel told everyone to honor God. The second angel announced that God would destroy Babylon. The third angel announced that God would punish those who followed the beast. The fourth speaker encouraged believers who would die before Jesus returned.

#### 14:10a

**he too will drink the wine of God’s anger,**

* then he too will drink the wine of God’s fury,
* will also experience God being very angry with them.

**he too will drink the wine:** This clause begins the results of the conditional clause in 14:9b–c. For example:

> then that person will also drink

**too:** This word indicates that the people who took the mark will also drink God’s wine. For example, the NASB says:

> also

**will drink the wine:** Here this phrase symbolically refers to experiencing something. The people who have taken the mark will experience God’s fury.

In some languages the meaning of the metaphor will not be clear. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning of the metaphor in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Here the phrase “drink the wine” is a metaphor for experiencing something. The people who have taken the mark will experience God’s fury.

* Translate the meaning without the metaphor. For example:

    > experience

    > undergo the terrible punishment *You may then want to give the literal words in a footnote. An example footnote is:*

    > Literally: “drink the wine.”

**God’s anger:** The word *anger* refers to strong anger. In some languages the noun *anger* must be translated as a verb. For example:

> God being very angry

#### 14:10b

**poured undiluted into the cup of His wrath.**

* which has been poured undiluted into the cup reserved for his wrath.
* He will punish them to/in/with the full measure/amount of his anger.

**poured undiluted into the cup of His wrath:** There are two issues here.

Issue 1—Descriptive Relative Clause

This clause tells the reader more about God’s fury. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other kinds of fury and only this one has been *poured undiluted*. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about God’s fury. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> It has been poured undiluted into the cup of his wrath.

Issue 2—Metaphor

This metaphor refers to God’s great anger against those who worship the beast. Another way to translate it is:

> he/God has poured out his anger without relenting

This clause continues using the metaphor of God’s fury being like wine. If you translated the meaning of the metaphor in 14:10a, you should:

* Translate the meaning of the metaphor here as well. For example:

    > he/they will suffer the full force of God’s wrath

    > He/They will suffer its full consequences! *You may then want to give the literal words in a footnote. An example footnote is:*

    > Literally: “which has been poured full strength into the cup of his/God’s wrath.”

* Explain in 14:10b the meaning of the image in 14:10a. For example:

    > 10ahe will also drink of the wine of God’s fury. 10bGod will come against him with the full amount of his anger.

    > 10aYou will have to drink the wine that God gives to everyone who makes him angry. 10bYou will feel his mighty anger… (CEV)

**poured undiluted:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> which God has poured full strength

**undiluted:** At that time, people often mixed wine with water to dilute it. Then the wine was weaker. But God’s anger is not “diluted.” He will not withhold some of his anger.

**the cup of His wrath:** The word *cup* continues the metaphor of “wine” (14:10a). A cup was the usual container for drinking wine.

#### 14:10c

**And he will be tormented in fire and sulfur**

* That person will be tortured with fire and sulfur mixed together
* They will suffer greatly because of the flaming/burning sulfur

**And he will be tormented:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an intransitive clause. For example:

> He will suffer torment/pain

**tormented:** This word refers to causing someone to suffer. Other ways to translate this word are:

> brought much suffering

> caused pain

See how you translated this word in 11:10\.

**in fire and sulfur:** The BSB literally represents the Greek here. But the *fire and sulfur* were probably mixed together. Sulfur burns.

**sulfur:** The word *sulfur* refers to a yellow powder or rock\-like substance that burns with intense heat. In some languages people are not familiar with *sulfur*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain it in your translation. For example:

    > yellow rock called sulfur

* Use the major language word. If it is not well known in your language, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Sulfur is a yellow powder or rock\-like substance that burns with intense heat.

See how you translated this word in 9:17\.

#### 14:10d

**in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb.**

* before the holy angels and the Lamb.
* in the sight of sinless/blameless angels and in the sight of the Lamb.

**in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb:** This phrase indicates that the angels and the Lamb will see those people tormented. For example:

> in front of the holy angels and in front of the Lamb (NET)

**the holy angels:** Here the word *holy* indicates that the angels are set apart for service to God. It probably also indicates that they are morally and spiritually perfect. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> angels devoted to God

> angels whom God sends

> sinless/blameless angels

* **Associated Passages:** REV 14:10

**And the smoke of their torment rises forever and ever.**

* And the smoke of the fire of their torment rises for all time.
* The smoke of the fire that torments them goes up forever and ever. (GNT)

**And the smoke of their torment rises:** The fire and sulfur of 14:10c *torment* those who worship the beast. So *the smoke* from that fire is evidence *of their* continuing *torment*. In some languages it is more natural to explain the metaphor in your translation. For example:

> And the smoke from the fire of their torment rises

> And the smoke from their burning pain will rise (NCV)

**forever and ever:** The Greek phrase is literally “into the ages of the ages.” The word “age” refers to a very long time. The phrase “the ages of the ages” refers to eternity. For example:

> for timeless ages (JBP)

See how you translated this phrase in 1:6 or 10:6\.

#### 14:11b–d

**Day and night there is no rest for those who worship the beast and its image, or for anyone who receives the mark of its name:** The Greek words are literally “They do not have rest day and night, the ones worshiping the beast and its image and anyone who takes the mark of his name.” The words “The ones worshiping the beast and its image and anyone who takes the mark of his name” explain to whom the pronoun “They” refers. For example:

> they have no rest, day or night, these worshipers of the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name (RSV)

Also see the General Comment on 14:11b–d about reordering it.

#### 14:11b

**Day and night there is no rest**

* They will have no rest from the torment day or night,
* They will have no respite/relief/lull from their suffering day or night.

#### 14:11c

**for those who worship the beast and its image,**

* namely, those who worship/revere the beast and his image/statue,
* This will happen to the people worshiping/honoring the monster and his image,

#### 14:11b–c

**Day and night:** This phrase means “at all times.” The suffering does not stop at any time.

**there is no rest:** This phrase indicates that the torment never ceases. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> There is no relief (GNT)

> There will be no respite (REB)

In some languages it is necessary or more natural to translate the word *rest* as a verb. For example:

> They will not be able to rest from the torment

#### 14:11d

**or for anyone who receives the mark of its name.”**

* or anyone who accepts the mark of his name on his forehead or hand.”
* and to those who take the sign/symbol of his name.”

**anyone who receives the mark of its name:** The mark is the symbol of the beast’s name, as explained in 13:16c–18d. See a similar phrase in 14:9\.

##### **General Comment on 14:11b–d**

The Greek begins with the pronoun “they.” Then it explains to whom the pronoun refers. In some languages it is more natural to describe them first. For example:

> 11cThose who worship the beast and his image, 11dor anyone who receives the mark of his name 11bwill have no rest day or night.

**Here is a call for the perseverance of the saints**

* ¶ Here is a need for believers to patiently endure,
* ¶ So, God’s holy people will need to persevere.

**Here is a call for the perseverance of the saints:** The Greek words are literally “Here is the patient endurance of the saints.” Since those evil things will happen, believers should patiently endure. They should persevere when they suffer for Christ. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> Here is a call for the endurance of the saints (RSV)

> This requires the steadfast endurance of the saints (NET)

> In this situation God’s holy people…need endurance (GW)

See how you translated this phrase in 13:10\.

**the perseverance:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *the perseverance* refers to continuing to follow God during hardships or opposition. The attitude of patience is included in the meaning. Other ways to translate the Greek word are:

> patient endurance (NIV)

> patience to continue

See how you translated this Greek word in 1:9 or 13:10\.

**the saints:** This indicates that the *saints* are to patiently endure when they are persecuted.

**saints:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *saints* means “holy ones.” The word refers to all believers still alive on the earth. For example:

> God’s people (GNT)

See how you translated this word in 5:8 or 13:7\.

#### 14:12b

**who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.**

* namely, for those who obey God’s commands and continue to have faith in Jesus.
* Indeed, they do what God has commanded and are faithful to Jesus.

**who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus:** This clause tells the reader more about the saints in 14:12a. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that some saints obey God’s commandments and others do not. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about all the saints. For example:

> namely, those who obey God’s commandments and remain faithful

Another way to do that is to start a new sentence here:

> They obey God’s commandments and remain faithful to Jesus.

**who keep…the faith of Jesus:** This clause probably refers to continuing to follow Jesus. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> who…are faithful to Jesus (GNT)

> keep their faith in Jesus (NCV)

> who…remain loyal to Jesus (REB)

**the commandments of God:** The word *commandments* refers in general to the commands that God has given. In some languages it is necessary or more natural to use a verb. For example:

> what God commanded them to do

##### **General Comment on 14:12a–b**

In some languages it is more natural to translate the description of the saints first. For example:

> The saints, 12ball who obey God’s commandments and remain faithful to Jesus, 12aneed patient endurance.

#### 14:13a

**And I heard a voice from heaven telling me to write,**

* ¶ Then I heard speech from heaven saying,
* ¶ Then I heard someone in heaven say,

**a voice from heaven:** This phrase refers to either God, Jesus, or someone whom God told to speak. Translate this phrase so that it can refer to anyone in heaven. For example:

> speech from heaven

> someone say from heaven on God’s behalf

**telling me to write:** In the Greek, the word *write* is a command to John to write what the person in heaven told him. For example:

> “Write this:…” (NIV11\)

In order to avoid direct speech within direct speech, the BSB includes the command to write as part of the description of the angel. If your language does not have a way to express direct speech in this way, consider following the example of the BSB.

#### 14:13b

**“Blessed are the dead—those who die in the Lord from this moment on.”**

* “Write:(sing) Those who die in the Lord from now on are favored.”
* “Write this: ‘The people who die believing in the Lord Jesus from now on are in a good place in God’s eyes.’ ”

**Blessed:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Blessed* describes a person to whom God has shown favor/kindness. See how you translated this word in 1:3\.

**the dead—those who die in the Lord:** This phrase refers to those who die as faithful believers in the Lord Jesus. They do not stop believing when the beast persecutes them. For example:

> those who…die in the service of the Lord (GNT)

**Lord:** The word *Lord* refers to Jesus here. The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Lord* means “the one who has authority over (others),” or “owner.”

In some languages it is more natural to include “Jesus” in this phrase. For example:

> Lord Jesus

**from this moment on:** This phrase probably refers to when the second beast began to require everyone to take the mark (13:11–18\). The beast ordered people to kill all the believers they found (13:15c).

#### 14:13c

**“Yes,” says the Spirit, “they will rest from their labors,**

* The Spirit says/said, “Yes, they will rest from their hard work,
* The Holy Spirit says/said, “Indeed, they will rest from their hard work serving their Lord,

**“Yes,” says the Spirit:** The BSB has placed the phrase *says the Spirit* in the middle of the spoken words. Place it where it would be most natural in your language. For example:

> The Spirit says, “Yes,…” (NCV)

**Yes:** Here the word *Yes* confirms what the person in heaven said (14:13b).

**says the Spirit:** The BSB puts the verb *says* before *the Spirit*, who was doing the speaking. This is a poetic style in English. Place the verb *says* where it would be most natural in your language.

**the Spirit:** Here this phrase refers to the Holy Spirit. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer to someone else. If that is true in your language, you may want to make the meaning clear:

> the Holy Spirit

> the Spirit of God

**they will rest from their labors:** This clause explains how believers will be blessed. They will be blessed because they will rest.

**labors:** This word refers here to working hard to serve God. The believers suffered difficulties and persecution as they served God. They will not need to work hard and suffer in heaven. After believers die, they will rest and enjoy being with Jesus. For example:

> hard work (GNT)

#### 14:13d

**for their deeds will follow them.”**

* because their deeds on earth will be their proof in heaven.”
* because they will receive a reward for their godly deeds.”

**for:** There is a textual issue in 14:13d: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the word for (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some later Greek manuscripts have the word and (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. This conjunction introduces the reason why the believers will be blessed and enjoy rest. For example:

> because (GNT)

**their deeds will follow them:** This clause indicates that the good things that these people did while on earth will not be forgotten. The record or memory of these deeds will go with them into eternity. They will receive a reward for these good deeds. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> their good deeds go with them (NJB)

> the reward of all they have done stays with them (NCV)

> they will be rewarded for what they have done (CEV)

## Revelation 14:14 (id: 523107)

### Section 14:14–20: The person on the cloud harvested the earth

In this section, John saw one “like a son of man” seated on a white cloud. This person gathered the people of the earth just as someone harvests grain. Then an angel gathered the grapes of the earth, and squeezed the juice out. The juice represents God’s anger.

Other examples for this section heading are:

> The harvest of the earth

> The Earth Is Harvested (NCV)

> The person on a cloud gathered the people of the earth

#### 14:14a

**And I looked and saw a white cloud,**

* ¶ I looked, and look/hey, I saw a white cloud
* ¶ Then I looked around, and suddenly I saw a white cloud,

**And I looked:** John just finished talking about the future for believers. This clause indicates that he saw a new part of the vision. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> Once again I looked (JBP)

> Now in my vision I saw (NJB)

See how you translated this in 14:1\. But note that John used this phrase again here just fourteen verses later.

**and saw a white cloud:** The Greek words are literally “and look.” The word “look” emphasizes or calls attention to the words that follow. It also probably indicates surprise or suddenness. The word “look” is not a command to look at something. Other ways to translate the Greek phrase are:

> indeed/hey, a white cloud

> and look, a white cloud

> suddenly/unexpectedly I saw a white cloud

See how you translated this phrase in 14:1\.

#### 14:14b

**and seated on the cloud was One like the Son of Man,**

* and someone like a Son of Man sitting on it
* and a being like a man was seated on the cloud.

**and seated on the cloud was One like the Son of Man:** These words are similar to the words in Daniel 7:13\. In that verse, Daniel saw in a vision “one like a Son of Man coming with the clouds of heaven.” Many people in Jesus’ day understood that to be a vision of the Christ.

In some languages people are not familiar with Daniel 7:13\. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain it in a footnote. For example:

> These words are similar to the prophecy in Daniel 7:13 about the Christ. The words here were written to remind people of the prophecy in Daniel 7:13\.

**like the Son of Man:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Man* can mean “male,” “person,” or “mankind.” John probably implied that he was referring to Jesus here, but he only did so indirectly. The meaning here is probably the same as in 1:13\. See how you translated the same phrase there.

#### 14:14c

**with a golden crown on His head and a sharp sickle in His hand.**

* with a golden crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand.
* On his head he wore a leader’s/king’s headpiece/headdress made of gold, and in his hand he held a sharp harvesting knife.

**with a golden crown:** Here the Greek word that the BSB translates as *crown* refers to the headpiece that kings wear. It is a symbol of their authority. See how you translated a similar phrase in 4:4\.

**golden:** The word *gold* refers to a shiny, yellow metal that is very valuable. In some languages people are not familiar with *gold*. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain the meaning in your translation:

> expensive gold

> valuable metal/stones called gold

See how you translated this word in 3:18 or 4:4\.

**sickle:** This word refers to a long, curved knife with a short handle. It is used for harvesting grain crops. People swing the sickle near the ground to cut the stalks of grain. At that time they used both the stalks and the grain.

In some languages people are not familiar with a *sickle*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use the name of a tool that is used in your area for harvesting grain crops.
* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > grain\-harvesting tool

    > tool for harvesting grain/wheat

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, you may want to explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > A sickle is a long, curved knife with a short handle. It is used for harvesting grain crops.

* **Associated Passages:** REV 14:14

## Revelation 14:15 (id: 523109)

### Section 14:14–20: The person on the cloud harvested the earth

In this section, John saw one “like a son of man” seated on a white cloud. This person gathered the people of the earth just as someone harvests grain. Then an angel gathered the grapes of the earth, and squeezed the juice out. The juice represents God’s anger.

Other examples for this section heading are:

> The harvest of the earth

> The Earth Is Harvested (NCV)

> The person on a cloud gathered the people of the earth

#### 14:15a

**Then another angel came out of the temple,**

* Then another angel came out from the temple.

**temple:** The word *temple* refers to a building where God, or another deity, is believed to be present in a special way. People worship there. See how you translated this word in 3:12 or 7:15\.

This temple is the one in heaven (14:17\).

#### 14:15b

**crying out in a loud voice to the One seated on the cloud,**

* He shouted to the one/person who sat on the cloud,

**crying out:** Here the words *crying out* refer to speaking to someone who is far away. For example:

> shouted (NJB)

#### 14:15c–e

**Swing Your sickle and reap, because the time has come to harvest; for the crop of the earth is ripe:** These words are probably a metaphor for gathering people from the earth. The angel did not say whether the Son of Man should gather believers or unbelievers or both. See the note at 14:15e for ways to translate the metaphor.

#### 14:15c

**“Swing Your sickle and reap,**

* “Use/Swing your sickle and reap/harvest,

**Swing Your sickle:** The Greek clause is literally “send your sickle.” The Greek verb refers to reaching near the ground with the *sickle* to cut the stalks of grain. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> Use your sickle (GNT)

> Swing your sickle (GW)

**reap:** This word refers to cutting the stalks of grain and gathering them.

#### 14:15d

**because the time has come to harvest;**

* because the time to reap has come.
* because the harvest of the earth is ready/ripe,

**the time has come to harvest:** This clause indicates that now is the right time to reap. Here some languages may use a verb other than *come*. For example:

> the time to harvest has occurred

> now is the time to harvest

In some languages the verb *harvest* requires an object. For example:

> now it is time to harvest the earth

> now it is time to cut and gather the harvest

#### 14:15e

**for the crop of the earth is ripe.”**

* Indeed, the harvest of the earth is ripe/ready.”
* and the time to reap has come.”

**the crop of the earth is ripe:** This indicates that the crop was mature. For example:

> the earth is ripe for the harvest (GNT)

> the earth’s crop is ready/mature

As a metaphor it indicates that the time was right for God to gather the people of the earth.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer only to gathering food. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning of the metaphor in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > This sentence is a metaphor for gathering people from the earth. It may refer to believers, non\-believers, or both.

* Explain the meaning of the metaphor in your translation. For example:

    > the harvest of the earth is ripe, that is, it is time to gather the people of the earth

* Translate the meaning without the metaphor. For example:

    > 15cGo and gather, 15dbecause the time to gather has come, 15eand the people of the earth are ready to be gathered. *You may then want to give the literal words in a footnote. An example footnote is:*

    > Literally: “Send your sickle and reap, because the hour/time to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe.”

## Revelation 14:16 (id: 523112)

### Section 14:14–20: The person on the cloud harvested the earth

In this section, John saw one “like a son of man” seated on a white cloud. This person gathered the people of the earth just as someone harvests grain. Then an angel gathered the grapes of the earth, and squeezed the juice out. The juice represents God’s anger.

Other examples for this section heading are:

> The harvest of the earth

> The Earth Is Harvested (NCV)

> The person on a cloud gathered the people of the earth

#### 14:16a–b

This sentence continues using the metaphor that compares gathering people to harvesting grain.

#### 14:16a

**So the One seated on the cloud swung His sickle over the earth,**

* And the person seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth,
* So the person who was seated on the cloud moved his harvesting knife over the whole earth,

**swung His sickle over the earth:** The person probably swung his sickle close to the ground. He reaped the whole earth.

#### 14:16b

**and the earth was harvested.**

* and the earth was harvested/reaped.
* and harvested it.

**the earth was harvested:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> he gathered the harvest of the earth

> harvested the crops (CEV)

* **Associated Passages:** REV 14:16

## Revelation 14:17 (id: 523113)

### Section 14:14–20: The person on the cloud harvested the earth

In this section, John saw one “like a son of man” seated on a white cloud. This person gathered the people of the earth just as someone harvests grain. Then an angel gathered the grapes of the earth, and squeezed the juice out. The juice represents God’s anger.

Other examples for this section heading are:

> The harvest of the earth

> The Earth Is Harvested (NCV)

> The person on a cloud gathered the people of the earth

#### 14:17a

**Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven,**

* ¶ Another angel left/came\-out\-of the temple in heaven,

#### 14:17a–b

This sentence continues using the metaphor of harvesting with a sickle. However, the metaphor changes in 14:18–19\.

#### 14:17b

**and he too had a sharp sickle.**

* and he also held a sharp sickle/harvesting\-knife.

**sickle:** This word is the same Greek word as in 14:16a. Usually a much smaller curved knife was used to harvest grapes. But 14:19a indicates that the action here was the same as for the grain harvest in 14:16a. Use the same word or phrase for *sickle* as you did in 14:16\.

* **Associated Passages:** REV 14:17

## Revelation 14:18 (id: 523115)

### Section 14:14–20: The person on the cloud harvested the earth

In this section, John saw one “like a son of man” seated on a white cloud. This person gathered the people of the earth just as someone harvests grain. Then an angel gathered the grapes of the earth, and squeezed the juice out. The juice represents God’s anger.

Other examples for this section heading are:

> The harvest of the earth

> The Earth Is Harvested (NCV)

> The person on a cloud gathered the people of the earth

#### 14:18a

**Still another angel, with authority over the fire, came from the altar**

* Then another angel came from the altar, one who had authority over the fire there,
* Yet another angel came from the altar. He was responsible for the fire of this altar.

**with authority over the fire:** This clause indicates that the angel was responsible for keeping the fire under the altar burning. For example:

> who was responsible for the fire under the altar

**altar:** On earth, an *altar* is a platform on which people offer sacrifices or gifts to God. This *altar* is similar to the sacrificing altar in front of the Jewish temple. But this *altar* is in heaven in John’s vision. See how you translated this word in 6:9\.

#### 14:18b

**and called out in a loud voice to the angel with the sharp sickle,**

* and called loudly to him who had the sharp sickle,
* He shouted loudly to the angel with the sharp harvesting knife,

#### 14:18c

**“Swing your sharp sickle**

* “Use/Swing your sharp sickle

#### 14:18b–c

**called out:** Here the words *called out* refer to speaking to someone who is far away. For example:

> shouted (NJB)

#### 14:18d

**and gather the clusters of grapes from the vine of the earth,**

* and gather the bunches of grapes from the vine of the earth,

**the clusters of grapes from the vine of the earth:** This phrase is a metaphor for people (14:19b). In some languages people will not understand the meaning of a literal translation. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain the metaphor in a footnote. For example:

> The grapes here are a metaphor for the people that God judges and punishes (14:19\).

**the clusters of grapes:** The fruits named *grapes* grow in bunches on vines.

**grapes:** The word *grapes* refers to small, round fruits used to make wine. In some languages people are not familiar with *grapes*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Describe *grapes*. For example:

    > clustered vine fruit

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, you may want to explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Grapes are a small, round fruit used to make wine.

#### 14:18e

**because its grapes are ripe.”**

* because its grapes are ripe/ready.”

**its:** This pronoun refers to the earth’s vine here.

### Section 14:14–20: The person on the cloud harvested the earth

In this section, John saw one “like a son of man” seated on a white cloud. This person gathered the people of the earth just as someone harvests grain. Then an angel gathered the grapes of the earth, and squeezed the juice out. The juice represents God’s anger.

Other examples for this section heading are:

> The harvest of the earth

> The Earth Is Harvested (NCV)

> The person on a cloud gathered the people of the earth

#### 14:19a

**So the angel swung his sickle over the earth and gathered the grapes of the earth,**

* The angel swung/moved his sickle over the earth, cut off its bunches of grapes, gathered them

**swung his sickle over the earth:** The angel probably swung his sickle close to the ground. He swung it over the whole earth. He did not swing it to hit the earth.

#### 14:19b

**and he threw them into the great winepress of God’s wrath.**

* and threw them into the huge winepress of God’s great anger.
* and threw them into the place for collecting grape juice. This is the large place that contained God’s great anger.

**the great winepress of God’s wrath:** There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as *great*:

1. The word *great* describes the size of the winepress. For example:

    > a huge winepress, the winepress of God’s anger (NJB) *(BSB, RSV, NIV, NJB, NASB, NABRE, NLT, NET, REB, NCV, ESV, KJV)*

2. The word *great* describes the size of God’s anger. For example:

    > the wine press of God’s furious anger (GNT) *(GNT)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).Beale (page 775\) and Aune (page 846\) support interpretation (1\).

**winepress of God’s wrath:** In the Old Testament the *winepress* represents God judging evildoers (for example Isaiah 63:3–4 and Lamentations 1:15\). Grapes are crushed in a winepress. Likewise God will punish evildoers. Another way to translate this is:

> winepress that represents God’s great anger

**winepress:** At that time, a *winepress* was a hole dug in soft stone. People stomped or stood on the grapes to squeeze the juice out. The *winepress* had an outlet from which people collected the grape juice. The juice was made into wine.

In some languages people are not familiar with winepresses. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Describe the *winepress*. For example:

    > place to make grape juice/wine

    > place to crush grapes in order to get the juice

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. Some example footnotes are:

    > At that time, a winepress was a hole dug into soft stone. People crushed grapes in it and collected the juice.

    > At that time, a winepress was a hole dug in soft stone. Grapes were crushed in it. The winepress had an outlet to let people collect the grape juice. The grape juice was made into wine. Here it is a picture of God’s judgment against evildoers (Isaiah 63:3, Lamentations 1:15, Joel 3:13\).

## Revelation 14:20 (id: 523120)

### Section 14:14–20: The person on the cloud harvested the earth

In this section, John saw one “like a son of man” seated on a white cloud. This person gathered the people of the earth just as someone harvests grain. Then an angel gathered the grapes of the earth, and squeezed the juice out. The juice represents God’s anger.

Other examples for this section heading are:

> The harvest of the earth

> The Earth Is Harvested (NCV)

> The person on a cloud gathered the people of the earth

#### 14:20a

**And the winepress was trodden outside the city,**

* They were crushed by foot in that winepress outside of the city,
* Angels trampled them in that place outside the city.

**And the winepress was trodden:** The clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> They/Someone trod on them

**trodden:** This word refers to standing hard on something. The angels or someone stomped on the grapes to squeeze the juice out.

**outside the city:** These verses do not say which *city* this is. It might be Jerusalem or some other city. You should not say which city it is in your translation.

#### 14:20b

**and the blood that flowed from it**

* and blood flowed from the winepress,
* Blood came out from it,

**blood:** The blood here is probably a metaphor for God’s judgment and punishment of evil people.

**it:** Here this word refers to the winepress.

#### 14:20c

**rose as high as the bridles of the horses for a distance of 1,600 stadia.**

* rising as high as the horses’ headgear for a distance of 1,600 stadia.
* rising as high as people’s shoulders and flowing as far as three hundred kilometers.

**the bridles of the horses:** This phrase refers to a height of about 1\.4–1\.7 meters (4\.5–5\.5 feet).

In some languages people are not familiar with *horses*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the height in your translation. For example:

    > the horses’ heads/necks (about 1\.5 meters)

    > the horses’ heads/necks (about five feet)

* Explain the height in a footnote. For example:

    > This would be about 1\.5 meters high.

* Refer to shoulder or neck or eye height of people. For example:

    > men’s shoulders/neck *You may then want a footnote to explain the literal. For example:*

    > Literally: “the horses’ bridles.”

**bridles:** This word refers to the equipment on a horse’s head to guide the horse. It includes the straps around the head and probably a mouthpiece.

**the horses:** The word *horses* refers to large, four\-legged animals that weigh 500 kilograms (1100 pounds) or more. They are about 1\.5 meters (5 feet) high at the back. People ride horses.

In some languages people are not familiar with *horses*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the word in your translation. For example:

    > riding animals’

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, you may want to explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > A horse is a large, four\-legged animal that weighs 500 kilograms or more. They are about 1\.5 meters high at the back. People ride horses.

**1,600 stadia:** The Roman distance unit of measure is a stadium (plural is *stadia*). It is about 185 meters (607 feet). So *1,600 stadia* is about 300 kilometers (180 miles). It is approximately the distance that Judea is from its northern border to its southern border. You may want to:

* Use the Roman measure, as the BSB does. You may then want to explain the distance in a footnote. For example:

    > This is about 300 kilometers.

    > About 180 miles.

* Use the common measure in your area. For example:

    > 300 kilometers

    > 180 miles

    > 39,000 paces

    > the distance of walking 72 hours *You may then want to explain the literal words in a footnote. For example:*

    > Literally: “1,600 stadia.” The Roman measure of a stadium (plural is “stadia”) is about 185 meters.

## Revelation 15:1 (id: 523121)

### Section 15:1–8: Seven angels held seven plagues and victorious believers sang

In this section, John saw another sign in heaven. The sign was seven angels ready to cause seven plagues. He also saw a group of believers who had not submitted to Satan. They sang a song of praise to God and Jesus. Then he saw the seven angels prepare to inflict the plagues on those who refused to submit to God.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> John saw seven angels empowered to cause seven plagues and a group of believers in heaven

> The believers who were victorious over the beast sang praise

#### 15:1a

**Then I saw another great and marvelous sign in heaven:**

* ¶ Then I saw another sign/portent in heaven, a great and amazing one/sign,
* ¶ I saw another spectacular/important and wonderful vision in heaven.

**Then I saw another great and marvelous sign in heaven:** The Greek clause is literally “I saw another sign in heaven great and marvelous.” The phrase *great and marvelous* describes the *sign*. It occurs last in the clause to emphasize the fact that John thought that the sign was *great and marvelous*. For example:

> I saw in heaven another sign, indeed a great and marvelous one:

**great:** Here the word *great* refers to the intensity or importance of the sign. The word here does not refer to the size of the sign. Other ways to translate this word are:

> spectacular

> important

**marvelous:** This word refers to something that causes wonder, awe, or amazement. Other ways to translate this word are:

> wonderful (RSV)

> amazing (GNT)

**sign:** The word *sign* refers to something that has a symbolic meaning. It suggests or points to something other than itself. Other ways to translate this word are:

> mysterious sight (GNT)

> portent (RSV)

See how you translated this word in 12:1 or 13:13\.

**heaven:** The word *heaven* refers here to the place where God lives.

#### 15:1b

**seven angels with the seven final plagues,**

* namely, seven angels having seven disasters,
* The vision was seven angels, each holding one of the seven last plagues.

#### 15:1c

**with which the wrath of God is completed.**

* which are the last disasters, because God’s great anger will finish/end when/after those disasters happen.
* They are the last plagues because they are the final demonstrations of God’s wrath.

#### 15:1b–c

The sign (15:1a) is described here. The BSB indicates this with a colon (:) at the end of 15:1a. The RSV uses a comma (,) and allows the context to imply the connection in English. Other ways to translate this connection are:

> There were… (GNT)

> which was…

> namely,…

**seven angels with the seven final plagues, with which the wrath of God is completed:** The words after the long dash explain why these plagues were the last plagues. Other ways to translate this are:

> seven plagues, which are the last ones, because they are the final expression of God’s anger (GNT)

> seven plagues. These plagues are the last ones because when they occur God’s anger is finished

> seven plagues. These plagues are the last ones because God’s anger will end after they happen

**with:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *with* is literally “having.” The word “having” indicates that the angels were somehow holding the plagues. They would mix these plagues in the bowls (15:7b). Other ways to translate this word are:

> who had (NASB)

> bearing

> bringing

**plagues:** This word refers to disasters that harm a lot of people. It can refer to diseases that kill many people. It can refer to locusts that damage many crops. See how you translated this word in 6:8 or 11:6\.

### Section 15:1–8: Seven angels held seven plagues and victorious believers sang

In this section, John saw another sign in heaven. The sign was seven angels ready to cause seven plagues. He also saw a group of believers who had not submitted to Satan. They sang a song of praise to God and Jesus. Then he saw the seven angels prepare to inflict the plagues on those who refused to submit to God.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> John saw seven angels empowered to cause seven plagues and a group of believers in heaven

#### 15:2a

**And I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire,**

* ¶ And I saw something that looked like a glassy sea with fire mixed in it
* ¶ And I saw a place that looked like a smooth and shiny sea that had fire mixed throughout it.

**something like a sea of glass mixed with fire:** The thing that John saw looked like *a sea of glass mixed with fire*.

**a sea of glass mixed with fire:** The fire was probably *mixed* into the *sea of glass*. The fire was not on top of the *sea of glass*. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> a glassy sea blended/combined with fire

> a glass sea having fire mixed into it

The clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. Probably God or someone whom God sent mixed it. For example:

> a sea of glass that God/someone had mixed with fire

> a sea of glass that had fire throughout it

**a sea of glass:** This phrase refers to a large flat area. It was smooth and shiny like glass, not hilly or bumpy. See how you translated this phrase in 4:6\.

**mixed:** The Greek grammar indicates that the fire was already mixed with the sea of glass when John saw it.

#### 15:2b

**beside which stood those who had conquered the beast and its image and the number of its name.**

* and I saw the people standing by the sea who gained victory over the beast and his image/statue and over the number of his name.
* Furthermore I saw those who had victory in their faith over the beast, his image, and the number of his name. They were standing at that place that looked like a sea.

**beside which stood:** There are two ways to interpret the Greek preposition that the BSB translates as *beside*:

1. It means beside. For example:

    > standing by (GNT) *(BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NET, REB, NCV, ESV)*

2. It means on. For example:

    > standing on (NASB) *(NASB, NABRE, NLT, GW, CEV, KJV).*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).Aune (page 872\) says “it is not appropriate to regard the crystal sea as the ‘floor’ of heaven upon which its inhabitants stand.”

**those who had conquered the beast and its image and the number of its name:** This phrase describes those standing beside the sea. The BSB emphasizes the phrase in English by placing it after the verb “stood.” The Greek does not have an emphasized phrase. For example,

> And I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who had been victorious over the beast and his image and the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, holding harps of God. (NASB)

> Then I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire. I also saw those who had won the victory over the beast and its image and over the one whose name is represented by a number. They were standing by the sea of glass, holding harps that God had given them (GNT)

**those who had conquered:** These believers *had conquered* because they did not submit to the beast. They remained faithful to Jesus even when the beast tortured or killed them. The believers were not victorious because they had won a battle.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer only to fighting. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > those who had conquered by remaining faithful to Jesus

    > those who had been conquerors in their faith

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > These believers had conquered because they did not submit to the beast. They remained faithful to Jesus, even if the beast tried to make them disown Jesus.

**the beast and its image and the number of its name:** There is a textual issue in 15:2b: (1\) Early Greek manuscripts have the text the number of his name (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) A few later Greek manuscripts have the text his mark the number of his name (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. These are the three things that the believers were victorious over. They did not submit to the beast. They did not submit to his statue. They also did not allow anyone to put the number of his name on their forehead or hand.

#### 15:2c

**They were holding harps from God,**

* They each held a harp from God,
* They held harps that God had given to them.

**harps from God:** The Greek phrase is literally “harps of God.” This phrase probably indicates that God gave the harps. For example:

> harps from God (NJB)

The BSB clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> harps that God had given to them

**harps:** A harp is a stringed instrument. See how you translated *harps* in 5:8 or 14:2\.

### Section 15:1–8: Seven angels held seven plagues and victorious believers sang

In this section, John saw another sign in heaven. The sign was seven angels ready to cause seven plagues. He also saw a group of believers who had not submitted to Satan. They sang a song of praise to God and Jesus. Then he saw the seven angels prepare to inflict the plagues on those who refused to submit to God.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> John saw seven angels empowered to cause seven plagues and a group of believers in heaven

> The believers who were victorious over the beast sang praise

#### 15:3a

**and they sang the song of God’s servant Moses**

* and they were singing the song of God’s slave/servant Moses
* They began singing the song from Moses, who served God,

**sang:** The Greek grammar probably indicates that the people sang for some time. For example:

> were singing (NJB)

**the song of God’s servant Moses:** The phrase *God’s servant* describes Moses.

**the song of…Moses:** The phrase *the song of…Moses* probably refers to:

1. A song that Moses sang or wrote that is not recorded in the Old Testament.Aune (page 872\) perhaps leans this way.
2. A song with some of the same themes as Moses’ songs in Exodus 15:1–18 and Deuteronomy 32:1–43\.Osbourne (page 560\).

Translate in a way that allows for one or both meanings. For example:

> the song belonging to Moses

> the song by Moses

> the song that…Moses…had sung (CEV)

**servant:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *servant* can also be translated as “slave.” The word indicates that Moses belonged to God and served him. The word “slave” is used figuratively to indicate that Moses obeyed God well. See how you translated this word in 7:3 or 11:18\.

#### 15:3b

**and of the Lamb:**

* and the song to the Lamb, which was:
* and the Lamb’s song. They sang,

**and of the Lamb:** This phrase probably indicates that this song is about Jesus or is a song to Jesus.Beale (page 792\) says, “The saints praise the Lamb’s victory.” Smalley (page 386\) says the hymn is to both God and his Son. For example:

> the song sung to the LambOtomi Back Translation on TW.

> the song about the Lamb

**the Lamb:** This phrase is a symbolic title for Jesus. See how you translated this title in 5:6 or 14:1\.

##### **General Comment on 15:3a–b**

The Greek word usually translated “saying” occurs before the words of the song. It indicates that the words of the song follow in 15:3c–4e. The BSB and other English versions use the colon (:) to indicate that the words of the song follow. Indicate that 15:3c–4e are the words of the song. For example:

> and the song of the Lamb, saying, (RSV)

> and the song of the Lamb, which was:

#### 15:3c

**“Great and wonderful are Your works, O Lord God Almighty!**

* “Lord God All\-Powerful, your deeds are great and marvelous/amazing.
* “Lord God, the one who has all power. Your deeds are spectacular and wonderful.

**Great and wonderful are Your works, O Lord God Almighty!:** The direct address to God occurs after what is said to him. In some languages it is more natural to have the direct address first. For example:

> Lord God Almighty, great and wonderful are your deeds

In some languages it is necessary or more natural to translate *works* using a verb. For example:

> Lord God All\-Powerful, the things you have done are great and wonderful!

**Great and wonderful are Your works:** The BSB and other English versions have the description before the thing described. This is an English poetic style. In some languages it is more natural to have the description second. For example:

> Your deeds are great and wonderful

**Lord:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Lord* means “the one who has authority over (others),” or “owner.” God is ruler over all things. See how you translated this word in 1:8 or 14:13\.

**Almighty:** This word is a title which means, “one with the power to do anything.” For example:

> the All\-Powerful (NET)

See how you translated this word in 1:8 or 11:17\.

#### 15:3d

**Just and true are Your ways, O King of the nations!**

* King of the nations, your ways are just/right and true.
* Ruler of the nations! All that you do and say is upright and true.

**Just and true are Your ways:** The BSB and other English versions place the description before the thing described. This is an English poetic style. In some languages it is more natural to place the description second. For example:

> Your ways are just and true

**Just:** Here the word *Just* refers to doing what is right. Other ways to translate this word are:

> right (GNT)

> upright (NJB)

**true:** Here the word *true* refers to God’s ways not being deceitful.

**ways:** This word usually means “roads” or “paths.” It refers here to actions, sayings, and attitudes that show what kind of person someone is. In some languages it is necessary or more natural to translate this word using a verb or verbs. For example:

> all that you do and say

**O King of the nations:** There are two issues with this phrase.

Issue 1—The Greek text

There is a textual issue here:

1. Some Greek manuscripts have the nations. For example:

    > Just and true are your ways, King of the nations! (NRSV) *(BSB, GNT, NJB, NIV11, NRSV, NASB, NABRE, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NCV, ESV)*

2. Some Greek manuscripts have the ages. For example:

    > just and true are your ways, O King of the ages (REB) *(RSV, NIV84, REB)*

3. A few later Greek manuscripts have the saints. For example:

    > just and true \[are] thy ways, thou King of saints (KJV) *(KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\).The UBS Greek NT supports option (1\) with reasonable confidence.

Issue 2—Direct address

In the Greek and the BSB, this direct address to God occurs after what is said to him. In some languages it is more natural to have the direct address first. For example:

> King of the nations, just and true are your ways

> Ruler of all nations! Just and true are your ways!

They sang a song of praise to God and Jesus. Then he saw the seven angels prepare to inflict the plagues on those who refused to submit to God.

#### 15:4a

**Who will not fear You, O Lord,**

* Lord, who will not fear and respect/revere you
* Lord God, all people will indeed be in awe of you

#### 15:4b

**and glorify Your name?**

* and glorify your name?
* and acknowledge your glory/splendor!

#### 15:4a–b

**Who will not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name?:** This is a rhetorical question. It emphasizes that all people will *fear* God and *glorify* his name. Translate these words so that the meaning is emphasized. Some ways to do that are:

* Use a rhetorical question. For example:

    > Who will not fear you, Lord, and glorify your name? (NLT)

    > Lord, who won’t fear and praise your name? (GW)

* Use a statement. For example:

    > Lord, all will fear you and bring glory to your name!

    > Everyone will respect you, Lord, and will honor you. (NCV)

This question has two parts. In some languages it is more natural to translate them as two sentences. For example:

> Who will not stand in awe of you, Lord? Who will refuse to declare your greatness? (GNT)

> O Lord, who will not fear you? Who will not bring glory to your name?

**fear:** Here the word *fear* means “respect” or “revere.” People who *fear* God are humble before God and are in awe of him. They also realize he is all\-powerful and does as he chooses. So they respect him.

In some languages the word *fear* only means “be afraid of.” If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Include the meaning of “respect” or “revere.” For example:

    > fear and respect/revere

* Translate the meaning of *fear* as “respect” or “revere.” For example:

    > honor

See how you translated this word in 14:7\.

**O Lord:** The Greek word is literally “Lord.” The BSB and other English versions add the word *O*. In English it probably indicates a formal address, as speaking to someone of high status. Some English versions do not add this word. The context clearly indicates that God has high status. For example, the NJB says:

> Lord

In some languages it is more natural to have the direct address first. For example:

> Lord, who will not fear you, and bring glory to your name?

**Lord:** The word *Lord* refers to God here. In some languages it is more natural to include “God” in this phrase. For example:

> Lord God

**glorify Your name:** This phrase refers to honoring God. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> declare your greatness (GNT)

> acknowledge your glory

> do homage to your name (REB)

See how you translated a similar phrase “give glory” in 4:9 or 14:7\.

#### 15:4c

**For You alone are holy.**

* For only you are divine/perfect,
* Everyone should do that because only you are the sacred/unique one,

**For:** This conjunction introduces the reason for people to fear and glorify God. For example:

> because (NET)

**You alone:** Here the word *alone* means “only.” God is the only one who is holy. For example:

> You are the only holy one (GW)

**holy:** Here the word *holy* indicates that God is perfect and unique. He only does what is right. He is different from all other beings. Other ways to translate this word are:

> sacred/divine

> pure/perfect spiritually/morally

> unique/separate

See how you translated this word in 3:7\.

#### 15:4d

**All nations will come and worship before You,**

* and all nations will come before you and worship/revere you,
* and because all people groups will come to you and worship/honor you,

In Greek 15:4d begins with the same conjunction as in 15:4c. It introduces a second reason here. The NJB uses “and” to connect 15:4d with 15:4c under a single “For”:

> 4c For you alone are holy, 4dand all the nations will come and adore you

**worship before You:** This phrase indicates that the people will worship God in his presence.

**worship:** This word refers to honoring someone or something as sacred/divine. Other ways to translate this word are:

> venerate

> revere

See how you translated this word in 13:4 or 14:7\.

#### 15:4e

**for Your righteous acts have been revealed.”**

* and your righteous deeds are now seen/shown.”
* and because you have shown your just/right deeds to them.”

**for:** This conjunction introduces a third reason here. If you used “and” to introduce the clause in 15:4d, you may want to do the same here.

**Your righteous acts have been revealed:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *righteous acts* has several meanings. There are two ways to interpret it here:

1. It means right/just deeds. For example:

    > your righteous deeds have been revealed (NLT) *(BSB, NIV, GNT, NASB, NABRE, NLT, NET, NCV, ESV)*

2. It means right/just judgments. For example:

    > they know about your fair judgments (GW) *(RSV, GW, CEV, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).Aune (page 876\) and Swete (page 197\) support interpretation (1\).

This clause indicates that all people had seen God’s righteous deeds. This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. God revealed what he had done. For example:

> you have shown your righteous deeds

> you have revealed to them your right/just deeds

#### 15:5a

**After this I looked,**

* ¶ After those things, in heaven I saw

**After this I looked:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *this* is literally “these (things).” It refers to what John had already seen. This clause introduces a new scene in heaven. For example:

> After I saw those things I looked again

#### 15:5b

**and the temple—the tabernacle of the Testimony—was opened in heaven.**

* that the temple, namely, the tent of/containing the Testimony of God, was opened.
* that the temple became open. The temple is also called “the worship tent/place that is a reminder of what God has revealed.”

**and the temple—the tabernacle of the Testimony—was opened in heaven:** There is a textual issue in 15:5b: (1\) Early Greek manuscripts have the word and (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) A few later Greek manuscripts have the words and look (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. The Greek words are literally “the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony was opened.” There are three ways to interpret the connection between *temple* and *tabernacle*:

1. The phrase *the tabernacle of the Testimony* explains the word *temple*. For example:

    > the temple (the tent of the testimony) was opened (NET) *(BSB, NIV, NJB, NABRE, NLT, CEV, NET, NCV)*

2. The *temple* is a part of *the tabernacle of the Testimony*. For example:

    > the sanctuary of the tent of witness in heaven was opened (ESV) *(RSV, NASB, GW, REB, ESV, KJV)*

3. The *tabernacle of the Testimony* is inside *the temple*. For example:

    > the temple…open, with the Sacred Tent in it (GNT) *(GNT)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because *the temple* had the same function as *the tabernacle of the Testimony*.Aune (page 876\) has “the temple, namely, the tent of testimony.” The ark (chest or box) of the covenant was kept in the tabernacle and then later in the temple. Jews worshiped God first at the tabernacle and then later at the temple.

**the temple…was opened:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active or intransitive clause. For example:

> God commanded the temple to open and it did

> God caused the temple to open

> someone opened…the temple on God’s behalf

> the temple…became open

**temple:** The word *temple* refers to a building where God, or another deity, is believed to be present in a special way. People worship there. See how you translated this word in 3:12 or 14:15\.

**the tabernacle of the Testimony:** This phrase refers to the tent in which the Jews first worshiped God. They called it *the tabernacle of the Testimony* because it contained the box called “the ark of the covenant.” The ark held the tablets on which God had written the ten commandments. These commandments were called “the Testimony” (Exodus 34:29\). The tent and the ark reminded the Jews that God had made a covenant with them. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the tent of witness (RSV)

> the tent that witnesses/testifies to God

> the worship tent that shows that God is with us

> the worship tent that is a reminder of what God has revealed

**tabernacle:** This means “tent” here. It refers to a special tent where the Israelites worshiped God before the temple was built.

**Testimony:** The Greek word refers to something that is used as a reminder of something else. God made a covenant with the Israelites. He wrote the ten most important commands of that covenant on two tablets of stone. Those tablets were later called the *Testimony*. They were put in a box called “the ark of the covenant.” God also told the Jews to make this special tent in which they would worship him. The tent where the box was kept was also called the tent (or tabernacle) of the *Testimony*. All these things reminded the Israelites about God’s covenant with them. See the examples above.

**in heaven:** Here the word *heaven* refers to the place where God lives.

#### 15:6a

**And out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues,**

* The seven angels having the seven disasters came out of the temple.
* The seven angels came out of the temple, each holding a plague.

**And out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues:** The Greek words here use normal Greek word order. But the BSB and some English versions emphasize the phrase *out of the temple*. You should use your normal word order here. For example:

> The seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple (GNT)

**with:** The Greek word is literally “having.” See how you translated this word in 15:1\.

#### 15:6b

**dressed in clean and bright linen**

* They were clothed in clean, bright linen
* They wore clean and shiny clothes made of linen.

**dressed in clean and bright linen:** This clause explains that their clothing was made of *clean and bright linen*. But it does not describe the kind of clothing. If possible, use a general word for clothing. For example:

> clothed in linen, clean and bright (NASB)

> wearing clothes made of clean, shining linen

Some languages must say what kind of clothing it is. If that is true in your language, you should refer to a robe. For example:

> robed in pure bright linen (RSV)

**bright:** Here the word *bright* probably refers to the linen being bright. For example:

> bright (RSV)

**linen:** This word refers to expensive cloth made from a plant called flax. The cloth is smooth and strong, yet it is also soft.

In some languages people are not familiar with *linen*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > flax cloth

    > smooth cloth

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Linen is an expensive cloth made from a plant called flax. The cloth is smooth and strong yet soft.

#### 15:6c

**and girded with golden sashes around their chests.**

* and wore gold cloth bands around their chests.
* They also wore wide sashes made of gold around their upper bodies.

**girded with golden sashes around their chests:** The angels were wearing sashes similar to what Jesus wore, described in 1:13\. See how you translated the similar words (“with a golden sash around his chest”) there.

**golden:** The word *golden* indicates that the sashes were woven of thread made of gold. Gold is a rare metal of a somewhat yellow color. It was the most expensive metal at that time. It is naturally shiny and beautiful.

Some languages do not have a word for “gold.” If that is true in your language, you should use the major language word. See how you translated this word in 1:12 or 8:3\.

**sashes:** A sash went around the body like a belt but at chest height.

**chests:** This word refers to the part of the body below the shoulders but above the stomach and waist. It does not include the arms.

#### 15:7a

**Then one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels**

* Then one of the four living beings gave to the seven angels
* Then one of the four living beings gave to each of the seven angels

**four living creatures:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *living creatures* is literally “living (ones).” The word refers to beings that are like angels. The *living creatures* speak and praise God (4:8\). Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> four living beings (NLT)

> four living things/ones

See how you translated this phrase in 4:6 or 14:3\.

#### 15:7b

**seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God,**

* seven gold bowls that were filled with the great anger of God,
* a bowl. Each bowl was full of drink/wine/water that represents/symbolizes the wrath of God.

**seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God:** These words are a metaphor for God’s anger, that it is like water or another drink such as wine. In some languages it is not natural to speak of anger as a liquid. If that is true in your language, you may want to make the metaphor into a simile. For example:

> seven golden bowls filled with water/wine/liquid that represents the wrath of God

**bowls:** The Greek word here refers to a dish used to pour out offerings of liquids. It is similar to a soup bowl. You should not refer to them as “soup dishes” or anything related to food. Translate this word as you did in 5:8\.

#### 15:7c

**who lives forever and ever.**

* who lives forever.
* He/God lives forever!

**who lives forever and ever:** This clause tells the reader more about God. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other gods and only this one *lives forever and ever*. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about God. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> He lives forever and ever.

**forever and ever:** The Greek phrase is literally “into the ages of the ages.” The word “age” refers to a very long time, so the phrase “the ages of the ages” refers to eternity. For example:

> for timeless ages (JBP)

See how you translated this phrase in 1:6 or 14:11\.

**And the temple was filled**

* And the temple was full

#### 15:8a–b

**the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active or intransitive clause. For example:

> The smoke from the glory and the power of God filled the temple (NJB)

> the temple was full of smoke from the glory of God and from his power

#### 15:8b

**with smoke from the glory of God and from His power;**

* of smoke from the glory/splendor and power of God,
* of smoke. The smoke was a sign that the glory and power of God was there.

**smoke from the glory of God and from His power:** The *smoke* is evidence that the glory of God and his power were in the temple. The phrase implies that God was present at the temple. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> smoke which came from the glory and power of God

> smoke that was a sign that the glory and power of God was there

**glory:** Here this word refers to brightness. Much light comes from God. The word symbolizes greatness, power, splendor, and majesty. Other ways to translate this word are:

> splendor

> radiance

See how you translated this word in 1:6 or 14:7\.

#### 15:8c

**and no one could enter the temple**

* and everyone was unable to enter the temple
* It was impossible for anyone to enter the temple in heaven

**no one could enter the temple:** This clause indicates that it was not possible for anyone to enter the temple. No one could force their way in.Kistemaker (page 433\) says, “The fierceness of God’s wrath is so intense that no creature can enter his presence.” Smalley (page 392\) says, “It was impossible to enter the temple.” Other ways to translate this clause are:

> no one was able to enter the temple (NASB)

> it was not possible for anyone to enter the temple

#### 15:8d

**until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.**

* until all of the seven angels’ disasters occurred.
* until the seven angels had finished pouring out each of their plagues.

**until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed:** This clause indicates that the seven plagues from the angels were not yet finished. The context indicates that the plagues had not yet occurred. 16:1–21 tells the details of the seven plagues from the seven bowls.

This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active or intransitive clause. For example:

> until the seven angels finished pouring out the seven plagues

> until the seven plagues of the seven angels were past and over (JBP)

> the seven plagues from the seven angels came to an end

**Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels,**

* ¶ Then I heard someone in the temple speak loudly to the seven angels,
* ¶ Then I heard loud speech coming from the temple to the seven angels. It said,

**a loud voice from the temple saying:** John does not say who spoke here, but it probably does not refer to God (16:1b). Use a word or phrase that can refer to anyone (except God) in heaven. For example:

> loud words coming from the temple which said

> someone spoke loudly from the temple

**temple:** The word *temple* refers to a building where God, or another deity, is believed to be present in a special way. People worship there. See how you translated this word in 3:12 or 15:5\.

#### 16:1b

**“Go, pour out on the earth the seven bowls of God’s wrath.”**

* “Go and pour onto the earth God’s anger from the seven bowls.”
* “Go, pour the plagues/disasters on the earth from the seven bowls of God’s wrath.”
* “Go and empty over the earth the wine/drink/liquid that represents/symbolizes the great anger of God from the seven bowls.”

**Go:** The command *Go* indicates that the seven angels were to go from heaven down to earth.

**pour out on the earth the seven bowls of God’s wrath:** When the angels pour the contents of their bowls on the earth, it is symbolic of God doing something based on his wrath. The pouring of each bowl describes a different part of God’s angry response to the people living on earth.

**bowls of God’s wrath:** The phrase *bowls of God’s wrath* means “bowls containing God’s wrath” (as in the NET). In this vision, God’s wrath is like liquid in the bowls. These are the same bowls mentioned in 15:7\. See how you translated the similar phrase there.

* The first angel went and poured his bowl on the earth,
* The first angel went and emptied the plague from his bowl over the land.

**earth:** This is the same Greek word that the BSB translates as “earth” in 16:1b. This word could refer to the whole earth. But this plague affected people who live on land.

The next plague, in contrast, affects the sea (16:3a), so the BSB uses the word *earth* here. The Greek word can mean either “the whole earth” or *earth*.

#### 16:2b

**and loathsome, malignant sores broke out on those**

* and terrible, painful ulcers/sores appeared on the people
* So/Then foul/awful and virulent/dangerous sores occurred on those people

**loathsome:** The Greek word here refers to something bad or harmful. Other ways to translate this word are:

> horrible (NLT)

> harmful (ESV)

**malignant:** The Greek word here refers to something evil, painful, or dangerous to others. Other ways to translate this word are:

> grievous (KJV)

> evil (RSV)

**sores:** This word refers to open wounds or ulcers on the skin.

**broke out:** This phrase indicates that the sores emerged on the people. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> appeared (GNT)

> came upon (RSV)

> erupted

> afflicted

#### 16:2c

**who had the mark of the beast and worshiped its image.**

* who had the mark of the beast and worshiped/revered his image/statue.
* who had taken the sign/symbol of the monster and worshiped/honored his image.

**who had the mark of the beast and worshiped its image:** This clause refers to one group of people. They both had the mark and worshiped the beast’s image.

**mark:** This word refers to a sign or symbol that is easily seen. Here the mark indicated that the person followed the beast. These verses do not say how the mark was placed on the hand or forehead. See how you translated *mark* in 13:16 or 14:11\.

**worshiped:** This word refers to honoring someone or something as sacred/divine. Other ways to translate this word are:

> venerated

> revered

See how you translated this word in 13:4\.

**image:** Here this word refers to the statue of the beast. See how you translated *image* in 13:14 or 15:2\.

### Section 16:1–21: The angels poured the seven bowls

In this section, each of the seven angels in turn poured God’s wrath from his bowl. Each angel caused a different plague to happen on the earth. The people of the earth suffered greatly from the plagues, but they refused to repent.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The seven angels poured God’s wrath from seven bowls

> The seven bowls of God’s anger

#### 16:3a

**And the second angel poured out his bowl into the sea,**

* ¶ The second angel poured his bowl on/over the sea,
* ¶ The second angel poured the plague from his bowl onto the sea.

**second:** The word *second* refers to the next item after the first one. If counted, this item would be counted as number two. Other ways to translate this word are:

> the one after the first

> another

See how you translated this word in 4:7 or 14:8\.

**sea:** The word *sea* refers to a large body of water. A *sea* is often so large that someone standing on one side cannot see the other side. Here the word *sea* refers to seas and oceans in general. Some languages do not have a word or phrase for *sea*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > all the large bodies of water

    > saltwater

* Use the major language word.

See how you translated this word in 5:13 or 13:1\.

#### 16:3b

**and it turned to blood like that of the dead,**

* and the plague caused the sea to become like the blood of a dead person,
* So/Then it changed the sea into blood like a dead person’s blood.

**blood like that of the dead:** The phrase *like that of the dead* probably indicates that the blood was thick and dark red.

#### 16:3c

**and every living thing in the sea died.**

* and all living things in the sea died.
* Therefore everything in the sea died.

**every living thing:** This phrase refers to all animals, fish, and plants that live in the sea.

* ¶ The third angel poured the plague from his bowl onto the rivers and sources of water.

#### 16:4b

**and they turned to blood.**

* and the water in those places turned into blood.
* So/Then the rivers and springs became blood.

#### 16:4a–b

**third:** This refers to the next item after the second one. If counted, this item would be counted as number three. See how you translated this word in 4:7 or 14:9\.

**springs of water:** This phrase refers to places where water rises out of the ground. In some languages the word *springs* already indicates that water comes from them. If this is true in your language, do not translate the phrase *of water*. For example:

> springs

#### 16:5a

**And I heard the angel of the waters say:**

* Then I heard the angel of the water of the earth say,
* Then I heard the angel with the authority over all water say to God,

**the angel of the waters:** The Greek phrase that the BSB literally translates as *the angel of the waters* indicates that this angel probably had authority over all the rivers, lakes, and oceans. For example:

> the angel who had authority over all water (NLT)

**say:** This angel spoke to God. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly imply that he spoke to someone else. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

> say to God

#### 16:5b

**“Righteous are You, O Holy One, who is and was,**

* “Holy One, you who are and were, you are right/just,
* “Sacred/Unique One, who exists now and who has always existed, you are righteous,

**Righteous are You, O Holy One, who is and was:** The angel addressed God with the title *O Holy One*. But this title is in the middle of what he said to God. In some languages the title must be in a different place. For example:

> Holy One, you who are and who were,

> O Holy One, who are and were (NRSV)

**Righteous are You:** The Greek clause is literally “You are righteous.” It indicates that God was right to send these plagues to show that he has judged the people to be bad. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> You are just (NRSV)

> You are righteous in sending these plagues

> You are the Upright One (NJB)

**O Holy One:** This title is addressed to God. Here the word *Holy* indicates that God is perfect and unique. He only does what is right. He is different from all other beings. Other ways to translate this word are:

> the sacred/divine One

> you are the pure/unique/separate One

See how you translated the word *Holy* in 15:4\.

**who is and was:** These words indicates that God is eternal. Other ways to translate these words are:

> the One who is and was

> you who exist and who always existed

> you exist and always existed

See how you translated a similar phrase in 11:17 (“the One who is and who was”).

#### 16:5c

**because You have brought these judgments.**

* because you judged them in these ways.
* for you have sent these judgments against them.

**because:** There are two ways to interpret the Greek conjunction here:

1. It introduces why God is righteous (16:5b). For example:

    > for (NJB) *(BSB, NIV, NJB, ESV, NRSV, NASB, KJV, NLT, GW, NET)*

2. It introduces how God is righteous (16:5b). For example:

    > You are just in these your judgements (REB) *(RSV, NIV11, NABRE, REB)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because the lexicons support it.Aune, Beale, Lenski, Osbourne, and Smalley also support interpretation (1\).

**You have brought these judgments:** The Greek clause is literally “you judged these (things).” It indicates that God saw the evil things that people did and decided that the seven plagues were the proper punishment. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> you have judged the evil deeds of the people

> you have sent these judgments (NLT)

* **Associated Passages:** REV 16:5

### Section 16:1–21: The angels poured the seven bowls

In this section, each of the seven angels in turn poured God’s wrath from his bowl. Each angel caused a different plague to happen on the earth. The people of the earth suffered greatly from the plagues, but they refused to repent.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The seven angels poured God’s wrath from seven bowls

> The seven bowls of God’s anger

#### 16:6a

**For they have spilled the blood of saints and prophets,**

* For they spilled/poured the blood of your believers and prophets,
* Indeed, those people killed your holy people and your spokespeople,

**For:** This conjunction probably introduces an explanation. The BSB and some English versions use the conjunction *For*. Other English versions allow the context to indicate that it is an explanation. They do not explicitly translate the Greek conjunction. For example:

> They poured out the blood of God’s people…. (GNT)

**they have spilled the blood:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *spilled* is literally “poured out.” Both the Greek and the English phrase indicates that someone killed these believers because they believed in Jesus. God holds him or her or them responsible for killing these believers.

The use of the word *blood* is important here because it is used again in 16:6b. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> they spilt the blood (NJB)

> They poured out the blood (GNT)

> They took the life\-blood

In some languages a literal translation would not refer to killing. If that is true in your language, you should include that meaning in your translation. For example:

> they killed them so that their blood poured out

**they:** This pronoun refers here to the people who had the mark of the beast (16:2\).

**saints and prophets:** In the New Testament, the word *saints* refers generally to all believers. The *prophets* are a group of believers who prophesied.

**saints:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *saints* means “holy ones.” The word refers to all believers. For example:

> God’s people (GNT)

See how you translated this word in 5:8 or 14:12\.

**prophets:** A *prophet* is a person to whom God gives a message. The message (often called a “prophecy”) may include a vision, as in Ezekiel 1 and Daniel 8\. A prophecy may reveal something about past events, current events, or future events. The prophet speaks God’s message to the people or writes it down for their use. See how you translated this word in 2:20 or 11:18\.

#### 16:6b

**and You have given them blood to drink, as they deserve.”**

* and you gave to them blood to drink, as/since they have earned that punishment.”
* so you gave to them blood to drink. This punishment is what they deserve.”

**You have given them blood to drink:** This clause refers to the third plague (16:4\).

**as they deserve:** The word *deserve* refers to earning or being worthy of something. Since the people had killed believers, they deserved to receive punishment. For example:

> It is their due! (RSV)

> It is what they should get

* **Associated Passages:** REV 16:6

## Revelation 16:7 (id: 523149)

### Section 16:1–21: The angels poured the seven bowls

#### 16:7a

**And I heard the altar reply:**

* And I heard someone at the altar say,
* And I heard a voice from the altar. It said,

**(GNT:) Then I heard a voice from the altar saying** There is a textual issue in 16:7a: (1\) Early Greek manuscripts have the text the altar saying (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) A few later Greek manuscripts have the text another out of the altar saying (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. The Greek phrase is literally “of the altar saying.” There are two ways to interpret this clause:

1. It indirectly indicates that someone at or near the altar spoke. For example:

    > a voice from the altar saying (GNT) *(GNT, NLT, REB, NCV, KJV)*

2. It indicates that the altar itself spoke. For example:

    > the altar itself say (NJB) *(BSB, RSV, NIV, NJB, NASB, NABRE, GW, CEV, NET, ESV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because the literal Greek phrase “of the altar” probably refers to someone at the altar.Aune (page 888\) says this means “\[someone] from the altar.”

**altar:** On earth, an *altar* is a platform on which people offer sacrifices or gifts to God. This *altar* is similar to the sacrificing altar in front of the Jewish temple. But this *altar* is in heaven in John’s vision. See how you translated this word in 6:9\.

#### 16:7b

**“Yes, Lord God Almighty, true and just are Your judgments.”**

* “Lord God All\-Powerful, yes, your judgments are true and just/right.”
* “Lord God, the one who has all power. Your judgments are indeed true and righteous/proper.”

**Yes, Lord God Almighty:** The phrase *Lord God Almighty* is a direct address. In some languages it is more natural to have the direct address first. For example:

> Lord God Almighty, yes

**Yes:** Here the word *Yes* indicates that the speaker agrees with what the angel said (16:5b–6b).

**Lord:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Lord* means “the one who has authority over (others),” or “owner.” God is ruler over all things. See how you translated this word in 4:8 or 15:3\.

**Almighty:** This word is a title meaning “the one with the power to do anything.” For example:

> the All\-Powerful (NET)

See how you translated this word in 1:8 or 15:3\.

**true and just are Your judgments:** The BSB and other English versions have changed the order of the words in this clause. In Greek and in English doing this emphasizes the phrase *true and just* here.

In some languages it is more natural to use the normal order of the words. For example:

> your judgments are true and just

**true:** Here the word *true* indicates that God’s judgments do not have any deceit or lie in them.

**just:** Here the word *just* refers to judging correctly. Other ways to translate this word are:

> right

> proper

**judgments:** This word refers to God’s decision to punish the people who killed the saints and prophets. See how you translated this word in 16:5\.

#### 16:8a

**Then the fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun,**

* ¶ The fourth angel poured his bowl on the sun,
* ¶ The fourth angel poured the plague from his bowl on the sun,

**fourth:** The word *fourth* refers to the next item after three other things. If counted, this item would be counted as number four. See how you translated this word in 4:7 or 8:12\.

#### 16:8b

**and it was given power to scorch the people with fire.**

* and the sun now had the power/ability to burn people with its fire/heat.
* so the sun was able to burn people with its fire.

**it was given power:** The Greek clause is literally “it was given to it” (as in the NASB). It refers to receiving authority or power to do something. God gave to the sun the ability to burn people as fire burns people. For example:

> it was permitted (NET)

The clause is passive. Some languages must use an active or intransitive clause. For example:

> God gave power to the sun

> God caused the sun to have the power

> it received the ability/powerIn some languages “take” and “receive” is translated by the same verb. The English verb “receive” implies that someone gave the power, but the English verb “take” does not imply that. Your translation should imply or indicate that someone gave it.

> it now had the ability/power

Your translation should indicate or imply that someone gave the authority.

**to scorch the people with fire:** This phrase indicates that the sun became so hot that it hurt people on the earth. For example:

> to burn people with its fiery heat (GNT)

* **Associated Passages:** REV 16:8

## Revelation 16:9 (id: 523152)

### Section 16:1–21: The angels poured the seven bowls

In this section, each of the seven angels in turn poured God’s wrath from his bowl. Each angel caused a different plague to happen on the earth. The people of the earth suffered greatly from the plagues, but they refused to repent.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

#### 16:9a

**And the people were scorched by intense heat,**

* They were scorched by the great heat,
* The fierce heat burned the people,

**And the people were scorched by intense heat:** This clause indicates that people received severe and painful burns from the sun. The clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> The intense heat scorched them

**scorched:** This word refers to burning something quickly. Other ways to translate this word are:

> scorched (RSV)

> burned (GNT)

**intense heat:** Here the word *intense* means “much.” This heat was very hot. For example:

> fierce heat (GNT)

#### 16:9b

**and they cursed the name of God,**

* and they greatly slandered God,
* and/but they spoke evil of God,

**and:** There is some contrast here between the heat burning the people and the people not repenting but instead cursing God. For example:

> but (NRSV)

But in some languages it is more natural not to translate the contrast, as in the BSB. In some languages it is more natural to allow the context to indicate the correct connection and not translate the conjunction.

**they cursed the name of God:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *cursed* can also mean “blasphemed.” Here it refers to speaking evil about God. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> they blasphemed/dishonored God’s name

> they greatly slandered God

See how you translated a similar clause in 13:6 (“blasphemies against God,” BSB).

#### 16:9c

**who had authority over these plagues;**

* who controlled/caused these disasters,
* because he caused them to suffer in so many ways.

**who had authority over these plagues:** The Greek words are literally “the one having authority over these plagues.” It indicates that God commanded the angels to send these plagues. Other ways to translate these words are:

> who had control over these plagues (NIV)

> who had the power to cause such plagues (NJB)

This clause tells the reader more about God. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that John was thinking of other gods and only this one *had authority over these plagues*. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about God. For example:

> because he had authority over these plagues

#### 16:9d

**yet they did not repent and give Him glory.**

* but they refused to repent and glorify him.
* But/And they would not turn away from their own evil ways and honor God.

**yet:** The Greek connects 16:9d to 16:9b with the common conjunction that is often translated as “and.” People in some languages will see no contrast here between cursing God and refusing to repent. For example:

> and (RSV)

**they did not repent and give Him glory:** The BSB literally represents the Greek here. This phrase indicates that the people did not turn away from their worship of false gods. The purpose of turning away from false gods was to honor the one true God. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> they did not repent and acknowledge God’s glory

> they would not turn from their sins and praise his greatness (GNT)

> But no one turned to God and praised him. (CEV)

**repent:** This word refers to changing one’s mind, heart, and actions. In this case it refers to no longer worshiping the image of the beast. Some other examples are:

> turn back to God

> change their hearts and lives (NCV)

> leave the ways of sin and follow the ways of God

See how you translated this word in 2:5 or 9:20\.

**give Him glory:** This phrase refers to agreeing that God has glory. Other ways to translate this word are:

> acknowledge his majesty

> praise him that he is awesome

See how you translated similar phrases in 4:9 (“give glory”) or 14:7 (“give him glory”).

#### 16:10a

**And the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast,**

* ¶ The fifth angel poured his bowl on the first beast’s throne,
* ¶ The fifth angel poured the plague from his bowl on the place/seat where the monster ruled.

**fifth:** This word refers to the next item after four other things. If counted, this item would be counted as number five. See how you translated this word in 6:9 or 9:1\.

**throne:** A *throne* is the official chair of a king. It is a symbol for authority to rule. The beast ruled over the people as king. See how you translated this word in 1:4\.

**beast:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *beast* refers to any animal, often a wild animal. The BSB uses the word *beast* to imply that this being is fierce, dangerous, or evil. The word here refers to a demon or other spirit being that is fierce like a *beast*. This word probably refers to the first beast. See how you translated this word in 13:1\.

#### 16:10b

**and its kingdom was plunged into darkness,**

* and his kingdom became dark.
* So/Then darkness covered the whole place/land that he ruled over.

**and its kingdom was plunged into darkness:** This clause indicates that the plague caused the kingdom of the beast to become totally dark. This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active or intransitive clause. For example:

> and his kingdom became darkened

> so that darkness covered his kingdom (NET)

> and the plague plunged his kingdom into darkness

**its kingdom:** This phrase refers to both the land and the people under his rule.

#### 16:10c

**and men began to gnaw their tongues in anguish**

* The people were chewing their tongues because of their suffering
* The people of that kingdom suffered greatly and so began biting their tongues.

**and men began to gnaw their tongues in anguish:** This idiom indicates that the people suffered greatly. The Greek grammar probably indicates that they suffered for some time, not just briefly. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> its people began biting their tongues in pain (CEV)

> the people were chewing their tongues because of the suffering

Some languages do not use the idiom *gnaw their tongues* to express suffering. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Translate literally, since the reason that they *gnaw their tongues* was because of their *anguish*.
* Use the phrase in your language that expresses deep suffering. You may then want to explain the literal phrase. For example:

    > Literally: “gnawed their tongues.” This phrase expresses great suffering.

**men:** This word is general and refers to people (as in the GNT and NJB). Here it refers to the people who followed the beast.

**anguish:** This word refers to great pain or distress. Other ways to translate this word are:

> agony (NIV)

> great suffering

**and curse the God of heaven for their pains and sores;**

* and greatly slandered the God of heaven because of their great suffering and ulcers/sores,
* They greatly insulted God, the one ruling/living in heaven, because they suffered greatly and had many sores.

**curse:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *curse* can also mean “blaspheme.” It is the same word as in 16:9\. Translate this word as you did there.

**the God of heaven:** This phrase means “the God who lives/rules in heaven.” For example:

> the God who rules in heaven (CEV)

**pains:** This is the same Greek word that the BSB translates as “anguish” in 16:10c. Here it refers generally to all the suffering that the plagues caused.

**sores:** This word refers to open wounds or ulcers coming through the skin. Translate this word as you did in 16:2\.

#### 16:11b

**yet they did not repent of their deeds.**

* but they refused to repent of the things they had done.
* Still, they rejected turning away from their evil deeds.

**yet:** The Greek connects 16:11b to 16:11a with the common conjunction that is often translated as “and.” People in some languages will see no contrast here between cursing God and refusing to repent. For example:

> and (RSV)

**their deeds:** Here this phrase refers to the evil deeds that they had done. For example:

> their evil ways (GNT)

**And the sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates,**

* ¶ The sixth angel poured his bowl on the great Euphrates River,
* ¶ The sixth angel poured the plague from his bowl on the important Euphrates River.

**sixth:** This refers to the next item after five other things. If counted, this item would be counted as number six. See how you translated this word in 6:12 or 9:13\.

**great river Euphrates:** The Euphrates River flows through today’s nations of Turkey, Syria, and Iraq. The word *great* indicates that the river was important. The river provided many people with water in the dry regions of Syria and Iraq. See how you spelled the name *Euphrates* in 9:14\.

#### 16:12b

**and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings of the East.**

* and the river dried up to prepare the way for the kings/rulers from where the sun rises to come/cross.
* So/Then the river became dry. Therefore, it was ready for the rulers from the east to come and cross over.

**its water was dried up:** This clause indicates that the water in the river was gone. There was only a dry river bed.

The clause is passive. Some languages must use an active or intransitive clause. For example:

> the plague caused the river to dry up

> The river dried up (GNT)

> the river became dry

Your translation should indicate or imply that the plague caused the river to dry up.

**to prepare the way:** With the Euphrates River dry, the kings could easily cross the river. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> to provide a way (GNT)

> so that a way was made (NJB)

In some languages a verb must be used to indicate what was prepared. For example:

> to prepare the way for the kings from the east to come (NCV)

> to make the way ready for the kings from the East to cross it

**of the East:** The Greek phrase is literally “the rising of the sun.” This phrase is probably a poetic way to refer to the east. See how you translated this phrase in 7:2\.

#### 16:13a

**And I saw three unclean spirits that looked like frogs**

* Then I saw three frog\-like unclean/evil spirits,
* Then I saw three demons that looked like frogs.

**unclean spirits:** The BSB literally represents the Greek in this phrase. The phrase *unclean spirits* is a Hebrew idiom. It refers to spirits who are religiously unclean. They are impure and, therefore, unable to stand before God.

In some languages a literal translation of the phrase *unclean spirits* would have the correct meaning. For example:

> foul spirits (RSV)

> filthy spirits

But in some languages a literal translation would not have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to follow the BSB and then explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

> Literally: “unclean spirits.” The phrase “unclean spirits” is a Hebrew idiom that refers to these spirit being impure, that is, sinful. Sinful spirits are religiously unclean and therefore unable to stand before God.

**spirits:** The word *spirits* refers to beings that people usually cannot see. Angels and demons are *spirits*.

**frogs:** The word *frogs* refers to small four\-legged amphibians. They begin their lives in the water and then later live on land. They breathe air and eat insects.

#### 16:13b

**coming out of the mouths of the dragon,**

* and one unclean/evil spirit came from the mouth of the dragon,
* They came out of the mouths of the large, fierce, winged lizard,

**dragon:** This word refers to a mythical creature something like a huge lizard. See how you translated this word in 12:3 or 13:11\.

#### 16:13c

**the beast, and the false prophet.**

* one unclean/evil spirit came from the mouth of the beast, and one unclean/evil spirit came from the mouth of the false prophet.
* the monster, and the lying spokesman for the lizard.

**false prophet:** The second beast (13:11–17\) is described here as the *false prophet*. A true *prophet* is a person who speaks the message that God gives to him. But a *false prophet* is one who speaks a message that does not come from God. Other ways to translate this are:

> deceitful/lying prophet

> he who says he is a prophet but teaches lies

> spokesman for Satan

> false prophecy say\-er

See also how you translated the word *prophet* in 2:20 (“prophetess”) or 11:18\.

### Section 16:1–21: The angels poured the seven bowls

In this section, each of the seven angels in turn poured God’s wrath from his bowl. Each angel caused a different plague to happen on the earth. The people of the earth suffered greatly from the plagues, but they refused to repent.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The seven angels poured God’s wrath from seven bowls

> The seven bowls of God’s anger

#### 16:14a

**These are demonic spirits that perform signs**

* They are demonic/evil spirits doing miracles/portents,
* They are evil spirits, ones who do wondrous signs.

**demonic spirits:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *demonic spirits* is literally “spirit of demons” (as in the NIV84\). Here the phrase indicates that these *spirits* were demons. They were not some other kind of spirit. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> evil spirits (CEV)

> diabolical spirits (JBP)

**demonic:** This word refers to evil spirit beings. The phrase “demonic spirits” does not refer to the spirits of dead people. See how you translated this word in 9:20\.

**perform signs:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *perform signs* refers to an unusual event that people regard as having a special meaning. These *signs* were probably miracles that convinced people to follow the dragon and the two beasts. Other ways to translate the Greek word are:

> miracles (NJB)

> mysterious sights

> portents

> wonders (JBP)

See how you translated this Greek word in 13:13\.

#### 16:14b

**and go out to all the kings of the earth,**

* and they go to the kings/leaders of the whole inhabited earth,
* They go to every leader of the countries on earth

**all the kings of the earth:** There is a textual issue in 16:14b: (1\) Early Greek manuscripts have the word kings (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) A few later Greek manuscripts have the words kings of the earth and (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. The Greek word that the BSB translates as *earth* here refers to the inhabited earth. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> kings of all countries on the earth

> every king on earth

**kings:** This word here refers to the leaders of the nations.

#### 16:14c

**to assemble them for battle on the great day of God the Almighty.**

* to gather them for the war on the important/extraordinary day of God All\-Powerful.
* to bring them together to make war. That will be the great day, the day when God the All\-Powerful will conquer!

**battle:** The Greek word here refers to war, whether short (as in a single battle on a single day) or long (many battles over days or months). For example:

> war (NJB)

**the great day of God the Almighty:** This phrase refers to a day when God does something special. On *the great day* referred to here, God will destroy his enemies. For example:

> the great day of victory of God Almighty

The CEV translates this as a separate clause:

> that will be the day of God’s great victory

Some languages need to explain how the day is great. For example:

> the day that God Almighty does a great deed

> the day that God Almighty has a great victory

**the Almighty:** This word is a title which means “one with the power to do anything.” For example:

> the All\-Powerful (NET)

See how you translated this word in 1:8 or 16:7\.

### Section 16:1–21: The angels poured the seven bowls

In this section, each of the seven angels in turn poured God’s wrath from his bowl. Each angel caused a different plague to happen on the earth. The people of the earth suffered greatly from the plagues, but they refused to repent.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The seven angels poured God’s wrath from seven bowls

> The seven bowls of God’s anger

#### 16:15a–b

This verse interrupts the story of the sixth angel. The verse was probably placed here in response to talking about the “great day of God Almighty.” Jesus wants his followers to be ready for that day.

Therefore, you may want to:

* Indicate that the verse interrupts the narrative. The BSB and GNT use a separate paragraph for this verse. The RSV puts this whole verse in parentheses. The NJB puts a long dash before and after this verse. The NET uses an indented paragraph and parentheses. Almost all the English versions on *Translator’s Workplace* include this in quotation marks to show that it is Jesus interrupting what John saw. For example:

    > (“See, I am coming like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays awake and is clothed, not going about naked and exposed to shame.”) (NRSV)

    > 14…on that great judgment day of God the Almighty.

    > 15“Look, I will come as unexpectedly as a thief! Blessed are all who are watching for me, who keep their clothing ready so they will not have to walk around naked and ashamed.”

    > 16And the demonic spirits gathered… (NLT)

* Indicate in your translation that Jesus spoke. For example:

    > Suddenly Jesus spoke, “Look, I will come like a thief! Favored is the one who remains alert and keeps his clothes on, so that he will not be naked and people see his shame/nakedness.”

    > Jesus interrupted, “Look, I come like a thief! Blessed is he who stays awake and keeps his clothes with him, so that he may not go naked and be shamefully exposed.”

* Put this verse after 16:16 and name the combined verses 16:15–16\. You may then want to make clear that the warning refers to the “great day of God Almighty.” For example:

    > Regarding the great day of God Almighty, the Lamb said, “Behold, I come…

This verse is a warning from Jesus. It warns believers to be ready.

#### 16:15a

**“Behold, I am coming like a thief.**

* ¶ “Look/Hey, I will come unexpectedly, like a thief!
* ¶ Suddenly Jesus spoke, “Listen/Wow, I will come unexpectedly!

**Behold:** This word means “look.” The word emphasizes or calls attention to the words that follow. It is not a command to look at something. Other ways to translate this word are:

> Indeed/Hey

> Look (NJB)

> Listen! (GNT)

**I am coming like a thief:** This clause indicates that Jesus will come unexpectedly, as thieves do. The phrase *like a thief* does not mean that he will come to steal. It has the same meaning as in 3:3\. See how you translated it there.

#### 16:15b

**Blessed is the one who remains awake**

* Favored is the one who remains alert
* In a good place in God’s eyes are the people who remain on guard

**Blessed:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Blessed* describes a person who is in a good situation. In the Bible, the good situation results from God showing favor/kindness to the person.

This word does not primarily refer to a feeling. However, a person in this good situation will frequently have good feelings like happiness and joy. Do not use a word that only refers to material prosperity or physical health.

Other ways to translate this word are:

> Favored

> How good it is

> In a good/desirable position in God’s eyes

> Shown kindness by God

See how you translated this word in 1:3 or 14:13\.

#### 16:15c

**and clothed,**

* and keeps his clothes nearby,
* and have their clothes next to them.

#### 16:15b–c

**the one who remains awake and clothed:** These words refer figuratively to a believer being prepared and ready for something to happen.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer only to being awake and keeping clothes nearby. It would not refer to being prepared and ready for something to happen. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. For example:

    > These words refer figuratively to a believer being prepared and ready for something to happen.

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in your translation. For example:

    > being prepared/ready like the person who stays awake and keeps his clothes with him

* Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:

    > he who is prepared and ready *You may then want a footnote to explain the literal words. For example:*

    > Literally: “he who stays awake and keeps his clothes with him.”

**the one:** The words *the one* refers to anyone, man or woman.

**remains awake:** The Greek word here can mean “be awake” (as in the RSV, NIV, and GNT) or “be on watch” (as in the NJB). Translate this phrase so that it clearly refers to a believer remaining strong in his faith.

**clothed:** The Greek words are literally “keeping his clothes.” It probably implies wearing and guarding the clothes. Other ways to translate these words are:

> has kept his clothes on (NJB)

> guards his clothes (GNT)

#### 16:15d

**so that he will not go naked and let his shame be exposed.”**

* so that he will not walk around naked and people see his shame/nakedness.”
* In that way, they will not be naked in public and ashamed.”

**go naked:** The Greek words are literally “walk naked.” It refers to being naked in public. For example:

> walk around naked (GNT)

**let his shame be exposed:** The Greek clause is literally “they see his shame” (as in the KJV). The pronoun “they” is general and refers to anyone.

The word “shame” refers to the feeling of being naked in public, which would cause him shame. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> be ashamed in public (GNT)

> people see his shame/nakedness

### Section 16:1–21: The angels poured the seven bowls

In this section, each of the seven angels in turn poured God’s wrath from his bowl. Each angel caused a different plague to happen on the earth. The people of the earth suffered greatly from the plagues, but they refused to repent.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The seven angels poured God’s wrath from seven bowls

> The seven bowls of God’s anger

#### 16:16a

**And they assembled the kings**

* ¶ The demonic/evil spirits gathered the kings

Here John returns to describing his vision. This is not part of the quotation of Jesus’ words.

**they assembled:** The subject of the verb *assembled* is probably the three frog\-like demonic spirits (16:13\). For example:

> the spirits brought (GNT)

Your translation should clearly refer to the three frog\-like spirits. Your translation should not imply or refer to any group of believers in 16:15\.

**the kings:** The Greek word is literally “them.” The pronoun refers to the kings (16:14b). Your translation should clearly refer to the kings.

#### 16:16b

**in the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.**

* to the place called Armageddon in the Hebrew language.
* at Mount Magedon. Armagedon is its name in the language of the Jews.

**the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon:** This phrase indicates that the name *Armageddon* is a *Hebrew* word. *Hebrew* is the language of the people of Israel, the Jews.

**Armageddon:** This word means “Mount Mageddon.” This name in Greek is spelled *Harmagedōn*.

#### 16:17a

**Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air,**

* ¶ The seventh angel poured his bowl into the air,
* ¶ The seventh angel poured the plague from his bowl into the air above the earth.

**seventh:** The word *seventh* here refers to the next item after the sixth one. Here it also refers to the last of the seven angels. See how you translated this word in 8:1\.

**into the air:** This phrase refers to the place beneath outer space but above the ground. It is where the winds are.

#### 16:17b

**and a loud voice came from the throne in the temple, saying, “It is done!”**

* and in the temple loud speech from the throne said, “It has finished!”
* So/Then someone from the place/seat of ruling in the temple shouted, “It is over/completed.”

**a loud voice came from the throne in the temple:** There is a textual issue in 16:17b: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the word temple (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some later Greek manuscripts have the words temple of heaven (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT recommends it. The Greek word order is normal here. No phrase is emphasized. For example:

> a loud voice came out of the temple, from the throne (RSV)

**a loud voice came:** This phrase can refer to either God or to someone speaking on God’s behalf (as in 16:1\). Use a phrase that can refer to anyone in heaven. For example:

> loud speech which said

> someone shouted

**throne:** This word refers to the official chair of a king. It is a symbol of his power to rule. Here the word *throne* refers to the place from where God rules. See how you translated this word in 1:4\.

**temple:** The word *temple* refers to a building where God, or another deity, is believed to be present in a special way. People worship there. See how you translated this word in 3:12 or 15:5\.

**It is done:** The Greek clause is literally “It has happened” (as in the GW). This clause probably indicates that God’s punishments upon the people will be finished with this last plague.

**And there were flashes of lightning, and rumblings, and peals of thunder,**

* And/Then lightning, distant thunder, and nearby thunder occurred,
* Lightning flashed, thunder rumbled, and roared/crashed,

#### 16:18b

**and a great earthquake**

* and the earth shook greatly/violently.

#### 16:18a–b

**And there were flashes of lightning, and rumblings, and peals of thunder, and a great earthquake:** The Greek clause is literally “lightning, noises, peals of thunder, and a great earthquake occurred.” Here the word “noises” probably refers to the sound of distant thunder. The NLT translates this as:

> the thunder crashed and rolled, and lightning flashed. And a great earthquake struck…

See how you translated this in 11:19\.

**great earthquake:** This word refers to when the ground shakes strongly.

#### 16:18c

**the likes of which had not occurred since men were upon the earth—**

* There has never been such an earthquake since the creation of human beings; (GNT)
* The earthquake was the worst/biggest one since humanity/mankind had lived on earth,

#### 16:18d

**so mighty was the great quake.**

* this was the worst earthquake of all! (GNT)
* so tremendous was that earthquake. (NET)

#### 16:18c–d

**the likes of which had not occurred since men were upon the earth—so mighty was the great quake:** These words compare this earthquake to all other earthquakes. It says that this earthquake was the worst one. Other ways to translate these words are:

> such as had not occurred since people were upon the earth, so violent was that earthquake (NRSV)

> the worst since people were placed on the earth (NLT)

> There has never been such a powerful earthquake since humans have been on earth (GW)

**men:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *men* refers to people in general. For example:

> mankind (JBP)

**mighty:** This word means “big” or “great.” The earthquake caused the earth to shake a lot.

#### 16:19a

**The great city was split into three parts,**

* The great city broke into three parts,
* The earthquake split that important city into three parts

**The great city was split into three parts:** This clause refers to cracks forming in the ground. The cracks were so deep and wide that the people could not cross from one part of the city to another. Other ways to translate this are:

> The great city…split into three sections (NLT)

> The great city divided/separated into three

**The great city:** The word *great* implies that the city is an important or well\-known city. This phrase may refer to Babylon or Jerusalem or the whole unbelieving world. Your translation should not name the city here.

#### 16:19b

**and the cities of the nations collapsed.**

* and the cities of all nations fell down.
* and destroyed the cities on the earth.

**the cities of the nations:** This phrase refers to the cities around the earth. The earthquake destroyed them.

**collapsed:** This word indicates that the earthquake caused all the buildings in the cities to fall down.

#### 16:19c

**And God remembered Babylon the great**

* God now thought again about the great Babylon,
* And God did not forget the important/famous city of Babylon

**And God remembered Babylon the great:** The Greek clause is literally “the great Babylon was remembered before God.” It indicates that God thought again about the evil deeds of the people of Babylon. He decided to act against her at this time.

The clause does not indicate that God had forgotten about their evil deeds. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that God forgot. If this is true in your language, translate the correct meaning. For example:

> God considered Babylon the Great

> God turned again to/upon Babylon the Great

**Babylon the great:** The city of *Babylon* is called *great* because at that time it had a vast empire and great influence over neighboring countries. For example:

> great Babylon (RSV)

**Babylon:** The name of this city is probably a symbol for people who oppose God. The king of *Babylon* conquered Jerusalem about six hundred years before Jesus lived on earth. The city was well known for idol worship. It had a vast empire at that time.

But at the time that Jesus and John lived on earth, *Babylon* was only ruins. So it is a symbol here. It may refer to Rome, or it may refer to a future powerful city. So you should use the name *Babylon* here.

#### 16:19d

**and gave her the cup of the wine of the fury of His wrath.**

* and he made her drink the cup filled with the wine of his great anger.
* but gave to her the cup filled with his terrible anger to drink it all.

**gave her:** The pronoun *her* refers to Babylon. Here and in the following chapters the city is spoken about as if it were a woman. She was given the cup. For example:

> gave to her

This phrase implies that God made her drink the wine. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that she refused to drink. If that is true in your language, you may want to indicate that she drank. For example:

> made her drink

> gave to her and she drank

**the cup of the wine of the fury of His wrath:** The word *wine* is a metaphor for the *fury of His wrath*. The *cup* is part of that metaphor. The metaphor indicates that Babylon will experience the full intensity of God’s anger.

In some languages a literal translation would not indicate the correct meaning. If this is true in your language, you may want to:

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > These words indicates that Babylon will experience the full intensity of God’s anger.

* Translate the meaning without the metaphor. For example:

    > the full intensity of his great anger

See how you translated a similar metaphor (“the wine of God’s anger, poured undiluted into the cup of his wrath”) in 14:10\.

**wine:** Wine is an alcoholic beverage made from the juice of grapes. In some languages people are not familiar with *wine*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a general word for a common beverage in your area. You may then want a footnote to explain the literal word. For example:

    > Literally: “wine.”

* Use the word for the common alcoholic beverage in your area. You may then want a footnote to explain the literal word, using the major language word. For example:

    > Literally: “wine.”

See how you translated this word in 14:8\. You probably do not need to repeat here the part of the footnote explaining what wine is.

**the fury of His wrath:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *fury* refers to a great amount of emotion. The phrase refers to the great amount of anger that God has toward Babylon. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> his fierce wrath (NLT)

> his terrible anger (NCV)

**Then every island fled,**

* All the islands disappeared into the sea,
* Every island in the sea sank,

**Then every island fled:** This clause indicates in a poetic way that the islands sank into the sea. The earthquake caused them to sink. For example:

> All the islands disappeared. (GNT)

#### 16:20b

**and no mountain could be found.**

* and the mountains disappeared as well.
* and no one could see mountains because they were flattened.

**and no mountain could be found:** This clause indicates that the earthquake caused the mountains to crumble and fall down. The reason that *no mountain could be found* was because they were not there any longer. This is a passive clause. Some languages must use an active or intransitive clause. For example:

> no one could find the mountains

> the mountains disappeared (NJB)

> all the mountains vanished (GNT)

**And great hailstones weighing almost a hundred pounds each rained down on them from above.**

* And huge stones of hail, each about thirty kilograms, began falling from the sky upon people.
* Very large balls of ice, more than twice as big as a man’s head, began falling on people from the sky.

**And great hailstones weighing almost a hundred pounds each rained down on them from above:** The Greek clause emphasizes the phrase *great hailstones weighing almost a hundred pounds each*. If possible, emphasize this phrase in your language. For example:

> And, indeed, huge hailstones of about a hundred pounds each fell from the sky

**hailstones:** This word refers to clumps of frozen rain. Some languages do not have a word for “hail” or *hailstones*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > clumps of frozen rain

    > rain turned into ice

    > balls of ice

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, you may want to explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Hailstones are pellets or clumps of frozen rain.

See how you translated the word “hail” in 8:7\.

**weighing almost a hundred pounds each:** The Greek words are literally “weighing about a talent.” The word “talent” is a measure of weight which people of the time defined variously to be about 26 or about 36 kilograms (58 or 80 pounds). Since hail is made of water, the size of these hailstones is about 26 liters or 36 liters (7 or 10 gallons).

The exact weight is not important. The important thing is that they were much bigger than normal hail. Hail rarely exceeds half a kilogram (one pound) in weight. You may want to:

* Use the method of measuring weight in your culture. For example:

    > of about 30 kilograms each

    > each weighing seven stoneUsing the British measure of a stone, which is fourteen pounds or 6\.4 kilograms.

* Use the method of measuring volume in your culture. For example:

    > of about 30 liters each

    > of about 8 gallons eachUsing the American gallon.

    > of about 6 imperial gallons eachUsing the British gallon.

* Use something familiar in your culture that is about that weight or size. For example:

    > each about the size of a bale of rice

    > each about the size of a bag of feed *You may then want to include a footnote to explain the literal word. For example:*

    > Literally: “about a talent each.” A talent was 26 kilograms or sometimes 36 kilograms.

**rained down:** The words *rained down* here indicate that the hailstones came down from the sky. For example:

> dropped (RSV)

The Greek grammar probably indicates that the hailstones *rained down* for some time. For example:

> began falling

#### 16:21b

**And men cursed God for the plague of hail,**

* They greatly slandered God for causing the disaster of hail,
* And they blasphemed God for their suffering from this catastrophe,

**men:** Here this word refers generally to people. For example:

> people (NRSV)

**cursed God:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *cursed* can also be translated as “blasphemed.” It is the same word as in 16:9a. Translate this word as you did there.

**for the plague of hail:** This phrase explains why the people cursed God. For example:

> for sending a plague of hail (NJB)

**plague:** This word refers to disasters that harm a lot of people. Here the word refers to the suffering and death caused by the hail. For example:

> disaster (NCV)

#### 16:21c

**because it was so horrendous.**

* because the disaster/suffering was very bad/severe.
* for it caused extreme suffering.

**because it was so horrendous:** This clause tells the reason why the people cursed God. The Greek clause is literally “its plague is very great.” For example:

> its plague was extremely severe (NASB)

##### **General Comment on 16:21b–c**

In Greek, the word “plague” is used in both 16:21b and 16:21c. In both places, it refers to the hail. In some languages it is more natural to mention the plague only once, as the BSB does. Here is another way to say this:

> They cursed God because of the terrible plague of the hailstorm. (NLT)

* ¶ Then one of the seven angels with/holding the bowls approached me. He said,

#### 17:1b

**“Come, I will show you the punishment of the great prostitute,**

* “Come, I will show to you how the well\-known prostitute will be judged/punished,
* “Come with me, and I will show to you how God will punish the infamous/notorious harlot.

#### 17:1a–b

**Come:** In this vision, after speaking to John, the angel took him to a wilderness (17:3\). So the word *Come* is an invitation for John to accompany the angel. For example:

> Come with me. (NLT)

**I will show you the punishment of the great prostitute:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *punishment* often refers to the decision of a judge about whether someone is guilty or not. It can also refer to the declaration of what the punishment will be. For example, the RSV says:

> judgment

In 17:16–17, the angel shows John how the great prostitute is punished. If your word for “judgment” clearly implies here that the prostitute is punished as well, you may want to follow the RSV.

The noun *punishment* refers to that event. In some languages it is more natural to use a verb. For example:

> I will show you how the great prostitute will be punished.

> I will show to you how God will punish the great prostitute.

**great:** Here this word means “important” or “well\-known.” It does not mean that the woman was large or fat. It does not indicate that the woman was good or had good character. The context implies that she was a bad person. Other ways to translate this word are:

> notorious (GW)

> famous (GNT)

**prostitute:** This word refers to a woman who has sexual relations for money. A prostitute often entices men to have sexual relations with her.

Here the word is a metaphor for an evil and powerful city. Like a prostitute, this evil city enticed the kings of the earth. But in this case it enticed them to live in luxury with her and to worship idols with her. The English versions translate this word literally here. For example:

> harlot (NASB)

> whore (NRSV)

Be careful to use a word or phrase that is not vulgar. Use a word that can be read aloud in church without people being embarrassed by the word.

In some languages people will not understand the meaning of the metaphor. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > I will show you how the famous prostitute is to be punished, that great city… (GNT)

* Include a footnote. For example:

    > This word refers to an evil and powerful city. Like a prostitute who entices men to have sexual relations with her, this evil city enticed the kings of the earth to live in luxury with her and to worship idols with her.

#### 17:1c

**who sits on many waters.**

* who sits on/by many waters/rivers.
* She sits in control over many waters.

**who sits on many waters:** The phrase *who sits on many waters* indicates figuratively that this city was located near many rivers. It controlled the trade on these rivers. This was true of the city of Babylon at the time when it was a powerful city. At that time, most goods were carried by ship, so being near rivers meant that the city had power over trade there.

In some languages a literal translation would not indicate the figurative meaning of the word *on*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Indicate that the word is symbolic. For example:

    > who symbolically sits on many waters

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > who sits over/by many waters and controls them

**many waters:** The phrase *many waters* refers to rivers, streams, canals, and so on. In some languages it is not possible or natural to use the word *waters* for that general meaning. If that is true in your language, use the correct word or phrase. For example:

> many rivers (GNT)

In some languages it is better to list several kinds of bodies of water. For example:

> many rivers and canals

> many rivers and waterways

## Revelation 17:2 (id: 523179)

### Section 17:1–18: John saw the woman Babylon and the beast

In this section, John saw a woman sitting on a red beast. The woman had the symbolic name “Babylon.” An angel referred to her as a prostitute. The red beast had seven heads and ten horns. The beast worked together with her, but later he destroyed her.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The great/famous prostitute with the symbolic name Babylon was destroyed

> The red beast turned against the woman Babylon and destroyed her

#### 17:2a

**The kings of the earth were immoral with her,**

* The kings of the earth did immoral things/deeds with her,
* The leaders of the world’s nations joined her in unfaithfulness to God.

**The kings of the earth were immoral with her:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *with her* is literally “with whom” (as in the RSV), connecting to “the great prostitute” in 17:1\. It is emphasized in the Greek by putting it at the beginning of the sentence. For example:

> With her the kings of the earth committed adultery (NIV11\)

Some languages must put the phrase *with her* after the verb, as the BSB does.

**The kings of the earth:** This phrase refers to the leaders of nations around the world.

**were immoral:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *were immoral* refers generally to having sexual relations with someone who is not one’s spouse. It refers to both married and unmarried people.

In your culture, you may use a euphemism for this Greek word. For example:

> slept with women who was not their spouses

> did wrong with women who were not their wives

The word or phrase you use should be acceptable for reading aloud in public. See how you translated this phrase in 2:14 (“commit sexual immorality”).

This metaphor refers to the shameful deeds and greed of these kings. They were happy to be seduced by this woman. She lured them through offers of riches and power.

In some languages a literal translation would not indicate the figurative meaning of *were immoral*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:

    > The kings of the earth did shameful things/deeds with the people of this city

* Explain its figurative meaning in a footnote. For example:

    > This word/phrase indicates that the kings joined with the people of this city and did shameful things/deeds in the same way that someone commits adultery with a prostitute.

#### 17:2b

**and those who dwell on the earth were intoxicated with the wine of her immorality.”**

* and the people living on earth were also drunk with the wine of her adulteries.”
* Also, the inhabitants of the earth participated in her sinful/unfaithful deeds, becoming like drunks.”

**those who dwell on the earth were intoxicated with the wine of her immorality:** This clause symbolically indicates that the woman’s activities caused people to lose self\-control and right thinking, just as wine does.

In some languages it is more natural to translate this clause with *her immorality* as the subject. You may compare them to wine in a simile. For example:

> Her adulteries, like wine, made the people of the earth drunk

It is also possible to leave *the wine* implicit, because it is implied by the word *intoxicated*. For example:

> Her immoral ways have intoxicated the earth’s inhabitants

**were intoxicated:** This phrase refers to being drunk, in this case from wine. A person who drinks too much wine is unable to think, speak, or act normally. Use the word or phrase that is natural in your language to describe being *intoxicated*.

**the wine of her immorality:** This phrase compares the woman’s *immorality* to wine. This is a figure of speech referring to the idolatry and excessive pleasures of the great city. Another way to translate this is:

> her immoral ways, just like wine

**wine:** Wine is an alcoholic beverage made from the juice of grapes. In some languages people are not familiar with *wine*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > alcoholic grape juice/drink

* Use the word for the common alcoholic beverage in your area. You may then want a footnote to explain the literal word. You may have to use the major language word for *wine*. For example:

    > Literally: “wine.”

See how you translated this word in 14:8 or 16:19\.

##### **General Comment on 17:2b**

17:2b uses the metaphor of being drunk with wine to refer to a state of spiritual folly. The people worshiped the false gods of Babylon and shared in her excessive luxury. This caused them to become incapable of understanding spiritual things, which is like being drunk. In some languages a literal translation would not indicate the correct figurative meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. For example:

    > The phrase “intoxicated with the wine of her immorality” indicates that people participated in idolatry and excessive luxuries with the evil city. That caused them to become spiritually foolish.

* Explain its meaning in your translation. For example:

    > and the inhabitants of the earth became spiritually like a drunk person from sharing in her idolatry and her excessive luxuries

## Revelation 17:3 (id: 523181)

### Section 17:1–18: John saw the woman Babylon and the beast

In this section, John saw a woman sitting on a red beast. The woman had the symbolic name “Babylon.” An angel referred to her as a prostitute. The red beast had seven heads and ten horns. The beast worked together with her, but later he destroyed her.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The great/famous prostitute with the symbolic name Babylon was destroyed

> The red beast turned against the woman Babylon and destroyed her

#### 17:3a

**And the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness,**

* ¶ Then the angel took/carried me with the help of the Spirit into a wilderness.
* ¶ Then the angel took me under the Spirit’s power into an empty land.
* ¶ Then the angel took me by the Spirit’s power to a desolate/uninhabited land.

**carried me away in the Spirit:** In English Bibles, the titles and names of God normally begin with an uppercase (capital) letter. But ancient Greek writers used only one style of letters. So the Greek word that the BSB translates as *Spirit* can refer to either the human spirit or God’s Spirit. There are two ways to interpret it:

1. It indicates that the Holy Spirit took John places during the following experience. For example:

    > Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit (RSV) *(BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NASB, NABRE, NLT, CEV, NET, ESV, NCV)*

2. It indicates that John’s spirit (as opposed to his physical body) experienced the following event. For example:

    > He took me in spirit (NJB) *(NJB, NRSV, REB, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because it is probably used in the same way as in 1:10\. See how you translated the phrase *in the Spirit* there. The clause implies that John’s experience in 1:10 continues, but at a new location.

**wilderness:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *wilderness* refers to a place that is empty, desolate, or uninhabited. See how you translated this word in 12:6 or 12:14\.

#### 17:3b

**where I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast**

* There I saw a woman sitting on a red beast
* I saw a/that woman there sitting on a bright red monster.

**a woman:** This woman was referred to as “the great prostitute” in 17:1\. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer to a different woman. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Clearly indicate in your translation that it is the same woman. For example:

    > that woman

* Explain who she is in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > This is a vision of the great prostitute (17:1\).

**sitting:** The woman was sitting on the beast’s back or shoulders.

**scarlet:** This word refers to a bright red color.

**beast:** The word *beast* probably refers to the first beast (13:1\). See how you translated this word in 13:1 or 16:13\.

#### 17:3c

**that was covered with blasphemous names**

* with names that blasphemed/insulted God all over its body
* It had names that dishonored God on its body.

**that was covered with blasphemous names:** This clause indicates that the body of the beast had many *blasphemous names* on it. For example:

> that had names insulting to God written all over it (GNT)

**blasphemous names:** The word *blasphemous* here means “a saying that is against God.” The beast was perhaps using the names and titles that are rightfully God’s alone. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> names that dishonored God

> names that belong to God alone

See how you translated the phrase “blasphemous name” in 13:1\.

#### 17:3d

**and had seven heads and ten horns.**

* and having seven heads and ten horns.
* It had seven heads and ten horns.

**had seven heads and ten horns:** You should translate this phrase as you did in 13:1\.

**horns:** This word refers to horns like animal horns. These verses do not say what kind of animal horn it was.

* **Associated Passages:** REV 17:3

## Revelation 17:4 (id: 523182)

### Section 17:1–18: John saw the woman Babylon and the beast

In this section, John saw a woman sitting on a red beast. The woman had the symbolic name “Babylon.” An angel referred to her as a prostitute. The red beast had seven heads and ten horns. The beast worked together with her, but later he destroyed her.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The great/famous prostitute with the symbolic name Babylon was destroyed

> The red beast turned against the woman Babylon and destroyed her

#### 17:4a

**The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet,**

* The woman wore purple and red clothes,
* The woman wore clothing of very expensive purple and scarlet cloth.

**The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet:** The dress that the woman wore was made of *purple and scarlet* cloth. Purple cloth was very expensive at that time. It was worn only by the most important officials.

Scarlet cloth was also somewhat expensive at that time. It was worn only by the very wealthy or by military leaders. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> The woman wore purple and scarlet clothing (NLT)

> The woman wore an expensive purple and scarlet dress

**purple:** Purple is a mix of blue and red:

Use the proper color word or use the name of something purple in your area. For example:

> lavender color

> the color of eggplant

#### 17:4b

**and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls.**

* and was adorned with gold, jewels, and pearls.
* She was decorated all over with gold, valuable stones, and beautiful pearls.

**and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *adorned* means “wearing.” The woman was wearing jewelry and other ornaments in order to make herself look attractive. This showed how wealthy she was. Other ways to translate these words are:

> adorned with gold and jewels and pearls (NRSV)

> was decorated all over with gold and valuable stones and pearls

**gold:** The word *gold* refers to a rare metal of a somewhat yellow color. It was the most expensive metal at that time. It is naturally shiny and beautiful. See how you translated this word in 1:12 or 9:20\.

**precious stones:** This phrase refers to rare stones that are naturally beautiful or become beautiful when shaped and polished. These rare stones are *precious* or expensive. The RSV translates this phrase as:

> jewels

The foundation of the new Jerusalem is made of 12 different *precious stones*. See the descriptions and pictures of those kinds of *precious stones* in the notes at 21:19–20\.

**pearls:** The word *pearls* refer to hard, shiny spheres up to 10 millimeters (half an inch) across. They are found in the shellfish called oysters. Pearls are often very beautiful. Good ones are very valuable.

Some languages do not have a word for *pearls*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use the major language word. You may then want to explain it in your translation or in a footnote. Some examples for explaining in your translation are:

    > beautiful pearls

    > expensive things called pearls *An example footnote is:*

    > A pearl is a hard, shiny sphere about 5–10 millimeters across. It is found in a kind of shellfish called the oyster. They are often very beautiful. Good ones are very valuable.

* Use something that people wear in your area that is beautiful and valuable. You may then want to include a footnote that explains the original word. An example is:

    > Literally: “pearls.” A pearl is a hard, shiny sphere about 5–10 millimeters across. It is found in a kind of shellfish called the oyster. They are often very beautiful. Good ones are very valuable.

#### 17:4c

**She held in her hand a golden cup**

* She held in her hand a golden cup,
* She held a cup made of gold,

**She held in her hand a golden cup:** In some languages it is not necessary to use both the word *held* and the phrase *in her hand*. If this is true in your language, translate naturally. For example:

> She had a golden cup in her hand (NCV)

> She was holding a gold cup

**golden:** The word *golden* indicates that the cup was made of gold. See how you translated this word in 1:12 or 8:3\.

**cup:** It is probably implied that the cup was a fancy, ornamental cup. For example:

> goblet (NLT)

#### 17:4d

**full of abominations and the impurities of her sexual immorality.**

* which was filled with detestable things and the impurities of her sexual sin.
* filled with obscenities and the nasty/detestable deeds of her adulteries.
* filled with the filthy and nasty things she had done. (CEV)

**abominations:** This phrase refers to things that are detestable or very awful. The phrase refers to the woman’s sinful life and deeds. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> abominable things (NIV)

> obscenities (NLT)

> detestable things (NET)

**the impurities of her sexual immorality:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *impurities* refers to impure things. These are things/deeds that God detests. The phrase refers to the results of the woman’s disgusting sexual practices. Those are again a figurative reference to the shameful things she did with the kings of the earth and its inhabitants (17:2\). Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> unclean things of her immorality (NASB)

> the impurities of her immorality (NLT)

> the foul things/practices of her sexual sins

## Revelation 17:5 (id: 523185)

### Section 17:1–18: John saw the woman Babylon and the beast

In this section, John saw a woman sitting on a red beast. The woman had the symbolic name “Babylon.” An angel referred to her as a prostitute. The red beast had seven heads and ten horns. The beast worked together with her, but later he destroyed her.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The great/famous prostitute with the symbolic name Babylon was destroyed

> The red beast turned against the woman Babylon and destroyed her

#### 17:5a–c

**And on her forehead a mysterious name was written: BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH:** The BSB and some English versions write this title with all capital letters. Other English versions capitalize the first letter of each word. Write this title as a name or title in your language.

#### 17:5a

**And on her forehead a mysterious name was written:**

* On her forehead these mysterious words were written:
* A name/title with hidden/secret meaning was on her forehead:

**And on her forehead a mysterious name was written:** There are two ways to interpret how the Greek word that the BSB translates as *mysterious* is used:

1. It describes the name or title on her forehead. The name was mysterious or secret. For example:

    > on her forehead a name was written, a mystery, (NASB) *(BSB, RSV, GNT, NJB, NIV11, NASB, NABRE, NLT, CEV, NET, REB, NCV, ESV)*

2. It is itself part of the name or title. For example:

    > upon her forehead \[was] a name written, MYSTERY (KJV) *(NIV, GW, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).Aune (page 936\) says, “Since the angel offers to explain ‘the mystery of the woman’ in v7, it is probable that the term…is not a part of what is written on the woman’s forehead.” Beale (page 858\) also supports interpretation (1\). Other ways to translate this interpretation are:

> On her forehead a mysterious name was written: (CEV)

> On her forehead was written a name, a mystery: (NET)

> On her forehead was written a name that has a secret meaning: (GNT)

**on her forehead a mysterious name was written:** The Greek grammar indicates that the writing was already there when John saw the woman. The clause is passive. Some languages must use an active or intransitive clause. For example:

> someone had written a name on her forehead

> On her forehead were these words:

> A name/title was on her forehead:

If you translate following the last two examples, your translation should imply that the title was written.

**mysterious:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *mysterious* refers to truth or knowledge that people have not discovered on their own. Someone else reveals it to them.

The name is told in 17:5b–c. So the mystery is probably that this particular name had not been told before. It is not explained here. People will have to read the name and try to understand its meaning. Other ways to translate this word are:

> a name of mystery: (RSV)

> a name that has a secret meaning: (GNT)

Also see how you translated this word in 1:20\.

#### 17:5b

**BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES**

* The Great Babylon, the Mother of Prostitutes
* The Famous Babylon, The Originator/Source of All Prostitutes,

**BABYLON:** The name of this woman is *BABYLON*. It is used in the same way in 14:8 and 16:19\.

**THE GREAT:** This word means “important” or “well\-known” here. It does not indicate that Babylon was good or noble in any way. See how you translated this word in 16:19 or possibly 17:1\.

**THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES:** This phrase indicates figuratively that the woman is the origin of all those who do prostitution. Here prostitution refers figuratively to worshiping idols and being unfaithful to God.

In some languages a literal translation would not clearly indicate the figurative meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. For example:

    > This phrase indicates figuratively that Babylon began the practices/ways of idolatry. She encouraged others to be unfaithful to God.

* Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:

    > The Originator of Prostitutes

**PROSTITUTES:** Here this word implies seduction, immorality, greed, and immoral selling practices, as well as other shameful deeds. See how you translated this word in 17:1\.

#### 17:5c

**AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.**

* and the Mother of the Detestable Deeds/Things of the Earth.
* and the Originator/Source of All the Obscene/Filthy Practices/Things Around the World.

**AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH:** The word “mother” is implied from 17:5b but not repeated here. The woman began the *ABOMINATIONS* and other people followed her in those sins. In some languages it is more natural to repeat the meaning of the word “mother” here. For example:

> Mother of the Abominations of the Earth

> Originator of the Abominations of the Earth

**ABOMINATIONS:** This word refers to deeds that are detestable or very awful. The word refers figuratively to the woman’s sinful life and deeds. Other ways to translate this word are:

> Obscenities (NLT)

> detestable things (NET)

See how you translated this word in 17:4 (“abominations”).

### Section 17:1–18: John saw the woman Babylon and the beast

In this section, John saw a woman sitting on a red beast. The woman had the symbolic name “Babylon.” An angel referred to her as a prostitute. The red beast had seven heads and ten horns. The beast worked together with her, but later he destroyed her.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The great/famous prostitute with the symbolic name Babylon was destroyed

> The red beast turned against the woman Babylon and destroyed her

#### 17:6a–b

**the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints and witnesses for Jesus:** This clause indicates that *the woman* drank *the blood of the saints and witnesses for Jesus*, which, in this symbolism, caused her to be *drunk*, that is, intoxicated as if drinking much wine.

#### 17:6a

**I could see that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints**

* I saw that the woman was as if drunk with the blood of the saints,
* I saw that the woman was so happy as to be like a drunk person because God’s people had been killed,

**the blood of the saints:** This phrase is an idiom that indicates that someone murdered *the saints*. The image of the first beast (13:15\) or the woman caused their deaths. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the blood from the dead bodies of the saints

> the deaths of the saints

The word *blood* is used in the same way as in 17:6a.

**saints:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *saints* means “holy ones.” The word refers to all believers. For example:

> God’s people (GNT)

See how you translated this word in 5:8 or 16:6\.

#### 17:6b

**and witnesses for Jesus.**

* namely, the blood of those who testified about Jesus.
* that is, the witnesses about Jesus who had been murdered.

**and witnesses for Jesus:** The Greek text begins here with a conjunction that the BSB translates as *and*. The English versions interpret this conjunction in two ways:

1. The conjunction means even, so 17:6b describes “the blood of the saints” in 17:6a. For example, the NLT says:

    > with the blood of God’s holy people who were witnesses for Jesus *(NIV, NLT, CEV, ESV)*

2. The conjunction means and, so two groups are referred to here. For example, the NASB says:

    > and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus *(BSB, RSV, GNT, NJB, NASB, GW, NET, NABRE, REB, NCV, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because the expressions in both 17:6a and 17:6b probably refer to believers who would not renounce Jesus.Smalley (432\) “‘witnesses to Jesus’…do not form a separate group from the…‘saints’.” But if the major language version follows interpretation (2\), you may want to follow that.

Some other ways to translate this word are:

> namely, the blood of those who bore testimony to Jesus

> that is to say, those who testify about Jesus

**witnesses for Jesus:** There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as *witnesses for Jesus*:

1. The word refers to those who publicly spoke about Jesus and called him their Lord. For example:

    > the witnesses to Jesus (NRSV)

    > those who testify about Jesus (GW) *(BSB, NIV, NRSV, NASB, NABRE, NLT, GW, NET, REB)*

2. The word refers to those who were faithful to Jesus. For example:

    > those who were killed because of their faith in Jesus (NCV) *(RSV, GNT, NJB, CEV, NCV, ESV, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\) because of similar use of the word in 1:2b, 1:9e, 6:9c, and 12:11b.Beale (page 860\) and Aune (page 937\) have “witnesses to Jesus.” Smalley (page 432\) says “witnesses *to* Jesus…or…his witnesses.”

#### 17:6c

**And I was utterly amazed at the sight of her.**

* ¶ When I saw her, I was very/totally amazed/astounded.
* ¶ I was very surprised at the sight of her.

**And I was utterly amazed at the sight of her:** The Greek says: “Having seen her, I marveled (with) great wonder.” Other ways to translate these words are:

> I was very surprised when I saw her (GW)

> This surprising sight amazed me (CEV)

Since 17:6a mentions seeing the woman, it is more natural in some languages not to repeat that here. For example:

> I was very amazed

* **Associated Passages:** REV 17:6

## Revelation 17:7 (id: 523188)

### Section 17:1–18: John saw the woman Babylon and the beast

In this section, John saw a woman sitting on a red beast. The woman had the symbolic name “Babylon.” An angel referred to her as a prostitute. The red beast had seven heads and ten horns. The beast worked together with her, but later he destroyed her.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The great/famous prostitute with the symbolic name Babylon was destroyed

> The red beast turned against the woman Babylon and destroyed her

#### 17:7a

**“Why are you so amazed?” said the angel.**

* Then the angel said to me, “Why are you amazed/astounded?
* Then the angel said to me, “You should not be surprised over her.

**“Why are you so amazed?”:** This is a rhetorical question. It emphasizes that John did not need to be surprised at seeing the woman. The rhetorical question may also be a slight rebuke. Translate this clause in a way that emphasizes that John did not need to be surprised. Some ways are:

* Use a rhetorical question. For example:

    > Why are you surprised? (GW)

    > How is it that you are so amazed?

* Use a statement. For example:

    > You should not be surprised.

#### 17:7b

**“I will tell you the mystery of the woman**

* I will explain to you the mystery about the woman
* I will tell you the hidden/secret meaning of this woman

**I will tell you the mystery of the woman:** The word *mystery* indicates that the angel would reveal something to John. He told John the secret meaning of the symbol of the prostitute. See how you translated the word *mystery* in 17:5, where the BSB translates it as “mysterious.” You may want to translate it the same way here. For example:

> I will interpret for you the mystery of the woman (NET)

> I will tell you the secret of this woman (NCV)

> I will tell you the secret meaning of the woman (GNT)

#### 17:7c

**and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and ten horns.**

* and the beast that she rides, which has the seven heads and ten horns.
* and of the monster on which she sits. This is the monster with the seven heads and ten horns.

**and of the beast that carries her:** The angel would also explain the mystery of the beast. This implies that the beast also had a secret or hidden meaning.

**carries:** Here the word *carries* refers to the woman sitting on the back of the beast.

**which has the seven heads and ten horns:** The information from 17:3d is repeated here in order to make clear which beast was meant.

### Section 17:1–18: John saw the woman Babylon and the beast

In this section, John saw a woman sitting on a red beast. The woman had the symbolic name “Babylon.” An angel referred to her as a prostitute. The red beast had seven heads and ten horns. The beast worked together with her, but later he destroyed her.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The great/famous prostitute with the symbolic name Babylon was destroyed

> The red beast turned against the woman Babylon and destroyed her

#### 17:8a

**The beast that you saw—it was, and now is no more,**

* The beast that you saw once was, now is not,
* The monster that you saw lived once, now is dead,

#### 17:8a–b

**it was, and now is no more, but is about to come up:** These words refer to once being alive, then being dead, and then in the future being alive again. These words probably refer to imitating Jesus’ death and resurrection. The beast will do that to deceive people. Other ways to translate these words are:

> is one that used to be and no longer is. It will come back (CEV)

> was once alive, but lives no longer; it is about to come up (GNT)

> was once alive but isn’t now. And yet he will soon come up (NLT)

**is about to come up:** This phrase implies that the beast will be alive at this time. If you translated “once was, now is not” as “once was alive, but now is not,” or similar wording, your translation should imply here that the beast is alive at the time he *is about to come up*. If it does not imply that, you may want to include that implied information in your translation. For example:

> was once alive, but lives no longer; it is about to come up alive

> was once alive but isn’t now. And yet he will live and soon come up

#### 17:8b

**but is about to come up out of the Abyss**

* and will ascend out of the bottomless pit
* and/but will arise alive out of the very/immeasurably deep hole that is the home of demons and the dead.

**but:** There is implied contrast between “is not” and “will come.” In some languages it is more natural to use “and” here.

**the Abyss:** The word *Abyss* refers to a very deep pit or chasm. It indicates that the pit or chasm was too deep to measure. Here it probably refers to something underground rather than a chasm. See how you translated this word in 9:1 or 11:7\.

#### 17:8c

**and go to its destruction.**

* and go to where he is destroyed.
* He will continue to live until God destroys him.
* He is destined for God to destroy him.

**and go to its destruction:** This clause indicates that God plans to destroy the beast. The word *go* refers figuratively to the beast’s life as a journey. At the end of his life journey, God will destroy him. But the focus here is on God’s plan to destroy him. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> and is destined for destruction

> only to meet with destruction (JBP)

> and will only live until God destroys him

The noun *destruction* refers to an event. In some languages it is necessary or more natural to use a verb for this event. For example:

> but only to be destroyed (CEV)

> but God will destroy him

**go:** The future tense phrase “about to” is implied from 17:8b but not repeated here. Your translation should use a future form here. For example:

> about to go

#### 17:8d

**And those who dwell on the earth whose names were not written**

* The people living on the earth whose names were not written
* The people of the earth whose names no one had written

**those who dwell on the earth:** This phrase refers to all people in a general way. But believers are not included (17:8e).

**whose names were not written:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. The Book of Life belongs to Jesus, called the Lamb (21:27\). For example:

> all whose names that the Lamb has not written

> all whose names that no one had written

> whose names were not written

**were not written:** The Greek grammar indicates that the event of writing the names happened earlier. The names not written in the book then are still not written now.

#### 17:8e

**in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world**

* in the Book of Life before the world/universe was created
* before God made the earth/universe in the book of those to whom he/God will give eternal life,

#### 17:8f

**will marvel when they see the beast**

* will be amazed when they see the beast,
* they will be surprised when they see the monster.

#### 17:8e–f

**the Book of Life:** This phrase refers to a *Book* that has names written in it. God will give eternal *Life* to the people whose names are in this book. Some languages need to explain the word *of*. For example:

> the book in which is the names of those who have eternal life

> the book with/having the names of those to whom God will give eternal life

See how you translated this phrase in 3:5 or 13:8\.

**from the foundation of the world:** There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as *from*. It should be translated in the same way as in 13:8\. See how you translated this phrase there.

#### 17:8g

**that was, and is not, and yet will be.**

* because he once was, now is not, but will again exist/live on earth.
* For the monster lived once, now is dead, yet will be there alive.

**that was, and is not:** These words have the same meaning as in 17:8a. Translate them in the same way here.

**and yet will be:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *be* is literally “be present.” For example:

> It was once alive; now it no longer lives, but it will reappear (GNT)

> this beast that used to be and no longer is, but will be once more (CEV)

> the beast, which once was alive, and is alive no longer, and has still to appear (REB)

**and:** There is implied contrast between the three clauses. For example:

> but (NET)

##### **General Comment on 17:8d–g**

There are four things said here that relate to one another:

1. Some people’s names were not written in the Book of Life.
2. That Book of Life was written before the beginning of the universe.
3. Those people will be amazed at the beast.
4. The beast once was, now is not, and yet will be present.

In some languages it is more natural to put some of that information into one or more sentences. For example:

> 8dThe inhabitants of the earth 8fwill be astonished when they see the beast, 8gbecause he once was, now is not, and yet will be present. 8dTheir names were not written 8ein the Book of Life before the creation of the world.

> 8dThe inhabitants of the earth 8fwill be astonished when they see the beast, 8gbecause he once was, now is not, and yet will be present. 8dThe Lamb did not write their names 8ein the Book of Life at the beginning of the world.

## Revelation 17:9 (id: 523192)

### Section 17:1–18: John saw the woman Babylon and the beast

In this section, John saw a woman sitting on a red beast. The woman had the symbolic name “Babylon.” An angel referred to her as a prostitute. The red beast had seven heads and ten horns. The beast worked together with her, but later he destroyed her.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The great/famous prostitute with the symbolic name Babylon was destroyed

> The red beast turned against the woman Babylon and destroyed her

#### 17:9a

**This calls for a mind with wisdom.**

* ¶ “A wise mind is needed.
* ¶ “This topic/issue/matter requires a mind with wisdom.

**This calls for a mind with wisdom:** The Greek clause is literally “Here is the mind which has wisdom” (as in the NASB and KJV). It urges readers to be wise regarding the symbolic meanings of the woman and the beast. The angel explained some of the symbolic meanings in 17:9–18\. The reader will need wisdom to understand what the angel explained. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> A mind with wisdom is needed here.

> This takes/requires a mind having wisdom.

> In this situation a wise mind is needed. (GW)

**wisdom:** The word *wisdom* means “the ability to understand events and know what should be done.” See how you translated this word in 5:12 or 13:18\.

#### 17:9b

**The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits.**

* The seven heads are symbolic of the seven hills where the woman is seated.
* The seven heads represent/symbolize seven hills, the seat/location of the woman.

**The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits:** The phrase *seven mountains on which the woman sits* explains the symbolic meaning of the *seven heads*. But the phrase *seven mountains on which the woman sits* is also symbolic itself. The city of Rome is located on seven hills. But Rome might be symbolic of a powerful country or empire. It might be symbolic of the human government controlled by the beast. You should translate the literal meaning of this phrase.

* **Associated Passages:** REV 17:9

## Revelation 17:10 (id: 523194)

### Section 17:1–18: John saw the woman Babylon and the beast

In this section, John saw a woman sitting on a red beast. The woman had the symbolic name “Babylon.” An angel referred to her as a prostitute. The red beast had seven heads and ten horns. The beast worked together with her, but later he destroyed her.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The great/famous prostitute with the symbolic name Babylon was destroyed

> The red beast turned against the woman Babylon and destroyed her

#### 17:10a

**There are also seven kings.**

* They are also symbolic of seven kings.
* The seven heads also represent/symbolize seven kings.

**There are also seven kings:** There is a verse numbering issue here. The GNT and some versions include this sentence at the end of 17:9\. You should place this sentence where the major language version does.

This clause is a second explanation of the symbolic meaning of the seven heads.

**kings:** Here the word *kings* may refer to many kinds of powerful leaders. They may not be the leaders of distinct countries. The word could even refer to rulers of empires. (An empire consists of more than one country.)

#### 17:10b

**Five have fallen,**

* Five of them are no longer,
* Five have fallen/ceased from their position of ruling,

**Five have fallen:** Here the words *have fallen* may figuratively indicate that these five kings are either:

1. no longer ruling,
2. no longer alive.

These verses do not say why they *have fallen*. You should not explain why they have fallen. For example:

> Five of them have already gone (NJB)

#### 17:10c

**one is,**

* one king is here now,
* and one king is now ruling,

**one is:** Here the word *is* probably indicates that this king was ruling either:

1. at the time when the vision is fulfilled,
2. at the time when John saw the vision.

You should not explain when this occurs. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> one still rules (GNT)

#### 17:10d

**and the other has not yet come;**

* and the other king has not yet come,
* and one king is not yet ruling.

**has not yet come:** This phrase probably indicates that this king had not yet begun to reign. For example:

> has not yet come to the throne

> has not yet become a ruler

#### 17:10e

**but when he does come, he must remain for only a little while.**

* but when he does come, he will be permitted to remain/stay for only a short time.
* But when he does rule, God will permit him to rule only for a short time.

**he must remain for only a little while:** Here the word *must* indicates that God is in control and has determined that this will happen. The phrase *remain for only a little while* indicates that God will let this king rule for only a short time. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> he will rule for only a little while (CEV)

> his reign will be brief (NLT)

> God will let him stay for only a little while

## Revelation 17:11 (id: 523196)

### Section 17:1–18: John saw the woman Babylon and the beast

In this section, John saw a woman sitting on a red beast. The woman had the symbolic name “Babylon.” An angel referred to her as a prostitute. The red beast had seven heads and ten horns. The beast worked together with her, but later he destroyed her.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The great/famous prostitute with the symbolic name Babylon was destroyed

> The red beast turned against the woman Babylon and destroyed her

#### 17:11a

**The beast that was, and now is not, is an eighth king,**

* The beast who once was, and now is not, will be an eighth king.
* The monster that lived once, and now is dead, is to be an eighth king.

**that was, and now is not:** See how you translated these words in 17:8\. Note that the conjunction *and* occurs between the clauses here. As in 17:8, there is implied contrast between the two clauses.

**is an eighth king:** The context probably indicates that the beast will become a king when he ascends from the Abyss (17:8b). In some languages it is more natural to refer to this future time. For example:

> will be an eighth king

> will return as the eighth king (CEV)

**eighth:** The word *eighth* here refers to the last of a total of eight kings. There may have been other kings of this empire or kingdom, but only eight are being considered here. Some languages use a phrase for the meaning of the word *eighth*. For example:

> the one after the other seven

> who became king after the seven kings

#### 17:11b

**who belongs to the other seven**

* He belongs with the seven kings
* He is like the other seven. (NLT)

**who belongs to the other seven:** There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as *belongs*:

1. The beast was like or connected to the other seven kings in some way. For example:

    > He is like the other seven. (NLT) *(BSB, RSV, NIV, NLT, GW, NCV, ESV, KJV)*

2. The beast was one of the seven kings earlier and became king again. For example:

    > who is one of the seven (GNT) *(GNT, NJB, NASB, CEV, NET, REB)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because it best follows the meaning of the Greek words.Osbourne (page 620\) says “he will follow their opposition to God.” Mounce (page 316\) says “He is of the seven—not one of the seven—in that he plays the same sort of role as his earthly predecessors.”

#### 17:11c

**and is going into destruction.**

* and will go to where he is destroyed.
* He will continue until God destroys him.
* He is destined for God to destroy him.

**is going into destruction:** These words indicate that it is God’s plan that the beast will be destroyed. See how you translated these words in 17:8\.

## Revelation 17:12 (id: 523198)

### Section 17:1–18: John saw the woman Babylon and the beast

In this section, John saw a woman sitting on a red beast. The woman had the symbolic name “Babylon.” An angel referred to her as a prostitute. The red beast had seven heads and ten horns. The beast worked together with her, but later he destroyed her.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The great/famous prostitute with the symbolic name Babylon was destroyed

> The red beast turned against the woman Babylon and destroyed her

#### 17:12a

**The ten horns you saw are**

* ¶ The ten horns that you saw are
* ¶ The ten horns that you saw represent/symbolize

#### 17:12a–b

**The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom:** This clause indicates that the ten horns represent ten future kings. For example:

> The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet begun to rule (GNT)

#### 17:12b

**ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom,**

* ten kings/leaders who have not yet been given a kingdom/country to rule,
* ten kings who have not yet begun to reign/rule over a country.

**received a kingdom:** This phrase probably indicates that someone would make each of these ten people a ruler over a region or country. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> received royal power (RSV)In some languages “take” and “receive” is translated by the same verb. The English verb “receive” implies that someone gave the power, but the English verb “take” does not imply that. Your translation should imply or indicate that someone gave it.

> come into power (CEV)

#### 17:12c

**but will receive one hour of authority as kings, along with the beast.**

* but who will be given royal/kingly authority together with the beast to rule for a short time.
* They will receive authority from the dragon to rule as kings with the monster for only a short time.

**will receive one hour of authority:** This phrase *will receive…authority* implies that someone will give these kings the authority to rule. Probably the dragon will give the authority and God will allow it as part of his plan. Your translation should not imply that the ten kings took the authority themselves. For example:

> who for one hour will be given authority

> to whom the dragon will give authority for one hour

**one hour:** Here the phrase *one hour* refers to a short time, not a literal hour. It might be the same length of time that the beast reigns (42 months) or it might be less than that time. You should:

* Use a word or phrase in your language that can refer figuratively to a short amount of time. For example:

    > an hour

    > a day

* Use a word or phrase that refers generally to a short time. For example:

    > a short time

## Revelation 17:13 (id: 523200)

### Section 17:1–18: John saw the woman Babylon and the beast

In this section, John saw a woman sitting on a red beast. The woman had the symbolic name “Babylon.” An angel referred to her as a prostitute. The red beast had seven heads and ten horns. The beast worked together with her, but later he destroyed her.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The great/famous prostitute with the symbolic name Babylon was destroyed

> The red beast turned against the woman Babylon and destroyed her

#### 17:13a

**These kings have one purpose:**

* These kings are of one mind.
* They will be united in purpose,

**These kings have one purpose:** This clause indicates that the ten kings will be united in how they rule. They will be in agreement. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> These ten all have the same purpose (GNT)

> These kings have a single intent (NET)

> These are of one mind (RSV)

#### 17:13b

**to yield their power and authority to the beast.**

* They will hand their power and right to rule to the beast.
* namely, they will obey the monster with all their power and authority.

**to yield their power and authority to the beast:** This clause explains what their united purpose is. The ten kings use their power to serve the beast and obey him. For example:

> in putting their strength and their powers at the beast’s disposal (NJB)

> namely, they will completely obey the beast with all their power and authority

**power:** Here the word *power* refers to having the ability to do something.

**authority:** Here the word *authority* refers to having the right and power to control or rule over someone or something.

* **Associated Passages:** REV 17:13

## Revelation 17:14 (id: 523201)

### Section 17:1–18: John saw the woman Babylon and the beast

In this section, John saw a woman sitting on a red beast. The woman had the symbolic name “Babylon.” An angel referred to her as a prostitute. The red beast had seven heads and ten horns. The beast worked together with her, but later he destroyed her.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The great/famous prostitute with the symbolic name Babylon was destroyed

> The red beast turned against the woman Babylon and destroyed her

#### 17:14a

**They will make war against the Lamb,**

* They will fight/war against the Lamb,

**They:** This pronoun probably refers to the ten future kings.

**make war:** This phrase refers to fighting by organized groups. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> fight a war

> battle

**the Lamb:** This is a title for Jesus. Jewish people killed a lamb at the Passover as a sacrifice to God. The lamb has symbolic meaning as a special sacrifice and is a symbol for the Christ. See how you translated this title in 5:6 or 15:3\.

#### 17:14b

**and the Lamb will triumph over them,**

* but the Lamb will defeat/conquer them

**triumph over:** Here the word *triumph over* refers to the Lamb defeating the kings in that war. For example:

> conquer (RSV)

#### 17:14c

**because He is Lord of lords and King of kings;**

* because he is Lord over all lords and King/Leader over all kings/leaders,
* because he has authority over all who have authority, and he rules all leaders.

**He is Lord of lords and King of kings:** These two phrases say almost the same thing. When a similar meaning is repeated, the repetition emphasizes that meaning. In some languages repeating a similar meaning has a different use. If that is true in your language, emphasize the meaning in a natural way. For example:

> he is indeed the Lord over all rulers

> he is Lord and King/Ruler over each and every leader

**Lord of lords:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Lord* means “the one in authority over (others),” or “owner.” The phrase *Lord of lords* indicates that Jesus has authority over all lords (and everyone else). See how you translated the word *Lord* in 4:8 or 16:7\.

**King of kings:** Similarly, the phrase *King of kings* indicates that Jesus has authority over all kings (and everyone else). Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> Leader over all leaders

> Ruler of all rulers

#### 17:14d

**and He will be accompanied by His called and chosen and faithful ones.”**

* and those with him are called and chosen and faithful.” (RSV)
* Those whom he chose and invited to follow him and who remained true to him will accompany him.”

**He will be accompanied by His called and chosen and faithful ones:** The Greek words are literally “those with him are called and chosen and faithful” (as in the RSV). The words refer to believers. Other ways to translate these words are:

> those who are with Him are the called and chosen and faithful (NASB)

> Those who are called, chosen, and faithful are with him (GW)

> those accompanying the Lamb are the called, chosen, and faithful (NET)

**He will be accompanied by:** These verses do not say how or where the followers are with the Lamb. They either fight alongside him or only accompany him as he fights.

In some languages it is necessary or more natural to indicate how the followers are with the Lamb. If that is true in your language, translate this phrase so that it allows for both possibilities. For example:

> accompanying him

> going with him in victory

**His called:** The word *called* refers to someone being invited to participate in something. Jesus has asked every believer to follow him. In some languages it is necessary or more natural to translate this phrase using an active verb. For example:

> those whom he invited to follow him

**chosen:** Jesus chooses each believer to follow him.

**faithful:** This word refers to people who continue to follow Jesus. Other ways to translate this word are:

> remain believing/believers

> continue following

##### **General Comment on 17:14b–d**

In some languages it is more natural to separate or reorder the information in 17:14b–d to make it clearer. For example:

> but the Lamb, 14dbringing his called, chosen, and faithful followers, 14bwill defeat them, 14cbecause he is Lord of lords and King of kings.

> but the Lamb 14cis Lord of lords and King of kings, and so 14bwill defeat them.14dGoing with him will be his called, chosen, and faithful followers.

## Revelation 17:15 (id: 523204)

### Section 17:1–18: John saw the woman Babylon and the beast

In this section, John saw a woman sitting on a red beast. The woman had the symbolic name “Babylon.” An angel referred to her as a prostitute. The red beast had seven heads and ten horns. The beast worked together with her, but later he destroyed her.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The great/famous prostitute with the symbolic name Babylon was destroyed

> The red beast turned against the woman Babylon and destroyed her

#### 17:15a

**Then the angel said to me,**

* ¶ Then the angel spoke to me again. He said,

#### 17:15a–c

**The waters you saw, where the prostitute was seated, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues:** The phrase *peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues* explains the symbol of *The waters…where the prostitute was seated*.

#### 17:15b

**“The waters you saw, where the prostitute was seated, are**

* “The waters/rivers where the prostitute sits, which you(sing) saw, are
* “The waters that you saw, where the prostitute sits, represent/symbolize

**waters:** This word refers generally to any body of water. It includes rivers, creeks, lakes, ponds, springs of water, and perhaps even oceans. Some languages have a general word for all these. For example:

> water/river

But some languages do not have a general word for any body of water. If that is true in your language, you may want to use a list. For example:

> rivers, creeks, lakes, and ponds

See how you translated this word in 17:1\.

**prostitute:** This word refers to a woman who has sexual relations for money. A prostitute often entices men to have sexual relations with her. Translate this word as you did in 17:1\. But you should not repeat the footnote here.

#### 17:15c

**peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.**

* peoples/nations, multitudes/populations, nations, and language groups.
* all peoples and regions/lands and countries and languages.

**peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues:** This list is similar to the lists in 5:9, 7:9, 11:9, 13:7, and 14:6\. Here the word *multitudes* replaces “tribe.”

**peoples:** In the singular, “people,” the Greek word refers to a whole people group that shares a common culture and language. It can also refer to a whole country, which may have many people groups within it. In the plural, *peoples*, it refers to a number of those groups. For example:

> nations (GNT)

**multitudes:** This word refers to large groups of people. It is often translated as “crowds.” But probably larger groups are meant here. For example:

> populations (REB)

**nations:** This word refers to whole people groups. They may be grouped by culture, language, or nationality. For example:

> country

**tongues:** This word refers to grouping people by what language they speak, their “mother tongue.”

##### **General Comment on 17:15c**

The meanings of the three words: “peoples,” “multitudes,” and “nations” are similar. All four words (including “tongues”) are used to emphasize that the “waters” represent people from every kind of people group. Some languages do not have three similar words like “peoples,” “multitudes,” and “nations.” If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use fewer words. For example:

    > peoples and languages and nations

* Use slightly different words to represent the different categories of people. For example:

    > peoples and regions/lands and nations and languages

## Revelation 17:16 (id: 523207)

### Section 17:1–18: John saw the woman Babylon and the beast

In this section, John saw a woman sitting on a red beast. The woman had the symbolic name “Babylon.” An angel referred to her as a prostitute. The red beast had seven heads and ten horns. The beast worked together with her, but later he destroyed her.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The great/famous prostitute with the symbolic name Babylon was destroyed

> The red beast turned against the woman Babylon and destroyed her

#### 17:16a

**And the ten horns and the beast that you saw will hate the prostitute.**

* The ten horns you saw and the beast will hate the prostitute.
* The ten kings represented/symbolized as ten horns and the monster will hate the prostitute.

**And the ten horns and the beast that you saw:** There is a textual issue in 17:16a: (1\) Early Greek manuscripts have the text the ten horns you saw and the beast (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) A few late Greek manuscripts have the text the ten horns you saw upon the beast (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. The Greek phrase is literally “the ten horns that you saw and the beast.” John had already seen the beast. This phrase emphasizes the fact that John had already seen the ten horns. For example:

> the ten horns that you saw, they and the beast (RSV)

**the ten horns:** This phrase refers figuratively here to the ten kings. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer only to the beast’s ten horns, not the ten kings. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > the ten horns, namely the ten kings,

* Translate the literal meaning and explain its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > This phrase refers figuratively here to the ten kings.

* Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:

    > the ten kings

**hate:** This word means “feel strong dislike toward someone and detest him.”

#### 17:16b

**They will leave her desolate and naked,**

* They will cause her to be abandoned and naked,
* They will forsake her and strip her.

**They will leave her desolate and naked:** The Greek clause is literally “they will make her desolate and naked” (as in the RSV). They will take Babylon’s possessions and her clothes. But it also describes her in a figurative way as being alone and shamed. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> They will take all her possessions and clothes from her

> They will strip her naked and leave her destitute (REB)

> They will take everything she has and leave her naked (NCV)

**They will leave her desolate:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *leave her desolate* refers here to being left with nothing. For example:

> they will take away everything she has (GNT)

#### 17:16c

**and will eat her flesh**

* they will eat her body,
* Then they will consume her corpse/remains

**and will eat her flesh:** This clause refers to the way a fierce animal attacks a person and devours the dead body. For example:

> They will eat her body (NCV)

This clause refers figuratively to the beast and the ten kings fiercely attacking Babylon and destroying her.

**flesh:** This word refers to the skin and muscles. But it can also include all the parts of the body that animals can eat.

#### 17:16d

**and burn her with fire.**

* and burn what was left of her body with fire.
* and burn her bones.

**burn her with fire:** They burned the parts of the body that they did not eat.

## Revelation 17:17 (id: 523208)

### Section 17:1–18: John saw the woman Babylon and the beast

In this section, John saw a woman sitting on a red beast. The woman had the symbolic name “Babylon.” An angel referred to her as a prostitute. The red beast had seven heads and ten horns. The beast worked together with her, but later he destroyed her.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The great/famous prostitute with the symbolic name Babylon was destroyed

> The red beast turned against the woman Babylon and destroyed her

#### 17:17a

**For God has put it into their hearts to carry out His purpose**

* They did that because God has caused them to do as he planned
* For God put the thoughts in their minds to do as he decided

**For:** This conjunction indicates that 17:17 is the reason for the attack and destruction of the woman in 17:16\. For example:

> because

**God has put it into their hearts:** Here the *heart* is where desires, purposes, and intentions are. Use a word that is normally used in your language for that meaning. It might be a different organ such as “liver,” or it might be a general word such as “insides.” For example:

> God has influenced their minds (NJB)

**to carry out His purpose:** This phrase indicates that the ten kings will do what God planned for them to do. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> to do what he intends (NJB)

> do what he wants them to do (GW)

#### 17:17b

**by uniting to give their kingdom to the beast,**

* by being of one mind in giving to the beast their authority to rule
* and so they will act together and give their ruling power to the monster.

**by uniting to give their kingdom to the beast:** This phrase indicates how they followed God’s plan: they submitted to the beast.

**uniting to give their kingdom to the beast:** The Greek words are literally “act with one mind and give their kingdom to the beast.” The kings decided together that they would give their authority to rule to the beast. Other ways to translate these words are:

> being of one mind and giving over their royal power to the beast (RSV)

> will agree to give their authority to the scarlet beast (NLT)

**give their kingdom to the beast:** See how you translated a similar phrase (“yield their power…to the beast”) in 17:13\.

#### 17:17c

**until the words of God are fulfilled.**

* until their deeds cause God’s words to come true.
* Their actions will cause God’s words to be fulfilled.

**the words of God are fulfilled:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. All that the beast and the ten kings did caused *the words of God* to be *fulfilled*. For example:

> their deeds/actions fulfilled God’s words

**the words of God:** This phrase refers to whatever God had previously told people concerning this time. It would include prophecies in the Old and New Testaments.

**are fulfilled:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *are fulfilled* means “came true” or “happened.” For example:

> comes true (CEV)

### Section 17:1–18: John saw the woman Babylon and the beast

In this section, John saw a woman sitting on a red beast. The woman had the symbolic name “Babylon.” An angel referred to her as a prostitute. The red beast had seven heads and ten horns. The beast worked together with her, but later he destroyed her.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The great/famous prostitute with the symbolic name Babylon was destroyed

> The red beast turned against the woman Babylon and destroyed her

#### 17:18a

**And the woman you saw is the great city**

* The woman that you(sing) saw is the great city
* The prostitute that you saw represents/symbolizes the well\-known/influential city

**And the woman you saw is the great city:** The phrase *the great city* explains the symbolism of *the woman*.

**woman:** Here this word refers to the prostitute. In some languages it is more natural or more clear to use that word here. For example:

> prostitute

**great:** Here this word means “important” or “well\-known.” See how you translated this word in 11:8\.

#### 17:18b

**that rules over the kings of the earth.”**

* that rules the kings of the earth.”

**rules:** The great city *rules* the kings by its economic influence (17:1\), moral influence (17:2\), and religious influence (17:3, 17:6\).

* **Associated Passages:** REV 17:18

## Revelation 18:1 (id: 523212)

### Section 18:1–24: Announcements/Messages about Babylon

In this section, three heavenly beings each announce something about Babylon. The first announcement is that the city is destroyed. Her riches and prosperity have been taken away.

The second announcement is that God’s people should leave Babylon before God destroys her. It also describes how kings and others mourn over the destroyed city.

The third announcement is that Babylon will never be built again.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> An angel announced that Babylon was destroyed, and some groups are sad

> Announcements about the destruction of Babylon

> Various people talk about Babylon

#### 18:1a

**After this I saw another angel descending from heaven**

* ¶ After those things, I saw another angel descending from heaven.
* ¶ After that, I saw another angel as he descended from heaven to earth.

**After this I saw:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *this* is literally “these (things).” It refers to what John had already seen. This clause introduces a new scene in heaven. For example:

> After I saw those things, I saw

**heaven:** Here the word *heaven* refers to the place where God lives.

#### 18:1b

**with great authority,**

* He had authority over many things,
* His right to rule was great,

**authority:** Here the word *authority* refers to having the right and power to control or rule over someone or something. For example:

> right to rule/govern

> power to control

These verses do not say what the angel had authority over. Some languages must say what the angel has authority over. If that is true in your language, refer generally to what the angel might have *authority* over. For example:

> authority over things

#### 18:1c

**and the earth was illuminated by his glory.**

* and the earth was lighted/alight with his splendor/radiance.
* and his glory made the earth bright. (NCV)
* and he shone brightly and lit up the earth.

**and the earth was illuminated by his glory:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> his splendor brightened the whole earth (GNT)

> his glory made the earth bright (NCV)

**illuminated:** Here this word refers to the angel’s splendor shining on the earth.

**glory:** The Greek word here is often translated as “splendor” (as the NJB has here). Other ways to translate this word are:

> radiance

> glorious light

See how you translated this word in 1:6 or 15:8\.

### Section 18:1–24: Announcements/Messages about Babylon

In this section, three heavenly beings each announce something about Babylon. The first announcement is that the city is destroyed. Her riches and prosperity have been taken away.

The second announcement is that God’s people should leave Babylon before God destroys her. It also describes how kings and others mourn over the destroyed city.

The third announcement is that Babylon will never be built again.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> An angel announced that Babylon was destroyed, and some groups are sad

> Announcements about the destruction of Babylon

> Various people talk about Babylon

#### 18:2a

**And he cried out in a mighty voice:**

* He shouted in/with a strong voice,
* He shouted powerfully,

**And he cried out in a mighty voice:** The phrase *in a mighty voice* is not emphasized in the Greek. So you do not need to emphasize this phrase in your translation. For example:

> He shouted with a powerful voice (NET)

**cried out:** The Greek word refers to speaking loudly so that many people can hear the message.

#### 18:2b

**“Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great!**

* “The great Babylon has fallen, indeed she/it has fallen!
* “The great city of Babylon is in ruins, complete ruins!

**Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great:** The Greek words are literally “The great Babylon fell fell.” The verb “fell” is repeated in order to emphasize it. The BSB emphasizes the verb by repeating it and by placing it first, in poetic style common in English. The GNT emphasizes the verb by using two complete sentences:

> She has fallen! Great Babylon has fallen!The pronoun “She” refers to Babylon here.

See how you translated these words in 14:8\.

**Fallen:** Here the word *Fallen* refers to the result of the beast (and others) destroying the city (17:16\).

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate or imply that the city fell because of some accident. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the implied meaning in your translation. For example:

    > has been destroyed and so has fallen

* Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:

    > has been destroyed

    > is finished/gone

* Explain the implied meaning in a footnote. For example:

    > This refers to the beast and others destroying the city (17:16\) as God planned (17:17\).

**Babylon:** *Babylon* had once been a very powerful city. The city was well known for idol worship. It controlled a vast empire at that time. One of its kings conquered Jerusalem. But at the time of Jesus and John, it was only ruins. So the name *Babylon* is a symbol here. It refers to a city, country, or empire that opposes God. This could include Rome or a future powerful city. Use the name *Babylon* here.

**the great:** The city of Babylon is called *the great* because it had once been an important and famous city. It had controlled a vast empire and held great influence in that region. See how you translated this phrase in 17:5\.

#### 18:2c

**She has become a lair for demons**

* She/It has become a place where demons live
* Demons live/dwell in her/it,

**She:** This pronoun refers to the city of Babylon. 18:2c–d describes it. 18:3a–c continues to use the metaphor of a woman for the city.

**a lair for demons:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *lair* refers to a location where someone or something lives. The *demons* live in the ruins of Babylon. People are no longer living there. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> a dwelling place of demons (RSV)

> a lair for demons (NET)

**demons:** This word refers to evil spirit beings. The word *demons* does not refer to the spirits of dead people.

#### 18:2d

**and a haunt for every unclean spirit, every unclean bird, and every detestable beast.**

* and a place where every unclean spirit, every foul/vile and hated bird takes refuge, and a place where every foul/vile and hated animal takes refuge.
* and all kinds of evil spirits and loathsome, disgusting birds and animals live there watching over her/it,

**haunt:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *haunt* refers to a place where an evil spiritual being lives. It probably includes the sense of guarding something. The demons probably watch over the ruins of Babylon and resent anyone trying to enter. Other ways to translate this word are:

> refuge

> place of watching/guarding

**unclean spirit:** The BSB literally represents the Greek of this phrase. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> foul spirit (RSV)

> filthy spirit (CEV)

The phrase *unclean spirit* is a Hebrew idiom that refers to the spirit being sinful. A sinful spirit is religiously unclean and, therefore, unable to stand before God. An unclean spirit has rebelled against God.

In some languages translating *unclean spirit* literally would not have the meaning above. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

> Literally: “unclean spirit.” The phrase “unclean spirit” is a Hebrew idiom that refers to the spirit being sinful. A sinful spirit is religiously unclean and, therefore, unable to stand before God.

**spirit:** The word *spirit* refers to a being that is usually not seen. Angels and demons are spirits.

**every unclean bird, and every detestable beast:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *every* here probably means “many different kinds.” For example:

> all kinds of filthy and hateful birds (GNT)

**unclean bird:** In the Old Testament, writers referred to these kinds of birds as living in desolate or deserted places (Isaiah 34:11, Jeremiah 50:39\). In Jewish culture, these birds were symbolic of demons. You may want to explain that implied meaning in a footnote. For example:

> In the Old Testament, writers referred to these kinds of birds as living in desolate or deserted places (Isaiah 13:20–21, 34:10–11, Jeremiah 50:39\). In Jewish culture, these birds were symbolic of demons.

**unclean:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *unclean* means “defiled” or “desecrated.” It can also have the figurative meaning of “unfit before God” here. For example:

> foul (RSV)

> filthy (GNT)

> vile/nasty

> disgustingUma Back Translation on TW.

**and every detestable beast:** There is a textual issue here:

1. Some versions include these words. For example:

    > a haunt for every unclean and detestable beast (ESV) *(BSB, NIV11, ESV, NRSV, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NCV)*

2. Some versions do not include these words. *(RSV, NIV84, GNT, NJB, NASB, KJV, REB)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the Greek NT 4 includes them.But they indicate that they had difficulty in deciding which text is correct. They include it with brackets around the phrase. Beale (page 895\) says, “a scribe’s eye inadvertently skipped from one phrase beginning with “and a prison of every”…to the next phrase beginning with the same words.” So it is missing from many manuscripts.

**detestable:** This word refers to things that people hate or avoid. Other ways to translate this word are:

> loathsome (NJB)

> hated

#### 18:3a

**All the nations have drunk the wine of the passion of her immorality.**

* For all the nations have drunk the wine of her passionate adulteries.
* For/Because all nations shared/participated in her/its passionate unfaithfulness to God.

The Greek of 18:3a begins with a conjunction that is often translated as “because” or “for.” For example:

> For (NIV)

This conjunction introduces the reason for Babylon being in ruins and being a home for demons and unclean birds and animals (18:2\). Some English versions, like the BSB, omit this conjunction and leave the connection with 18:2 implicit.

**All the nations have drunk the wine of the passion of her immorality:** This clause has an interpretation issue and also several metaphors. See how you translated the similar clause (“who has made all the nations drink the wine of the passion of her immorality”) in 14:8\.

Here the clause indicates that the nations have already drunk the wine of Babylon’s adulteries. For example:

> all nations have drunk the wine of her passionate unfaithfulness (JBP)

#### 18:3b

**The kings of the earth were immoral with her,**

* The kings of the earth did immoral things/deeds with her,
* The leaders of the world’s nations joined her in unfaithfulness to God.

**The kings of the earth were immoral with her:** This metaphor refers to the shameful deeds and greed of these kings together with the people or leaders of this city. See how you translated this clause in 17:2\.

#### 18:3c

**and the merchants of the earth have grown wealthy from the extravagance of her luxury.”**

* and the merchants of the earth became rich from her ability to buy expensive luxuries.”
* The sellers around the world became wealthy because she was able to buy so many fancy/expensive things.”

**the merchants of the earth have grown wealthy from the extravagance of her luxury:** There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as *luxury*:

1. It refers to expensive things that please the senses. For example:

    > the merchants of the earth have grown rich from the power of her luxurious living (ESV) *(BSB, NIV, NJB, NRSV, NASB, NABRE, NLT, GW, REB, NCV, ESV, KJV)*

2. It refers to great desire for sexual intercourse. For example:

    > the merchants of the world grew rich from her unrestrained lust (GNT) *(RSV, GNT, NET)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because it is the usual meaning of the Greek word.Beale (page 895\) translates this clause as “the merchants became rich *because of* the power of her luxury.” Aune (page 988\) also supports interpretation (1\). See the note below for further explanation of the Greek word that the BSB translates as *luxury*.

**merchants:** This word refers to those who buy, sell, and trade to make money. These *merchants* sold things to the people in Babylon.

**have grown wealthy:** This phrase refers to someone gaining lots of money. For example:

> have become rich (NASB)

**the extravagance of her luxury:** The Greek phrase is literally “the power/capability of her luxuries.” The phrase probably refers to Babylon’s vast desire for and ability to buy luxuries. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> her ability to buy excessive luxuries

> she was able to buy many expensive things

> her desires for extravagant luxury (NLT)

**luxury:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *luxury* refers to things that satisfy sensual desires. This would include things like perfume, expensive clothing, jewelry, and fancy foods. Other ways to translate this word are:

> sensuality

> expensive tastes

> desire for sensual/fancy things

##### **General Comment on 18:3c**

This clause indicates that Babylon’s greed for luxury goods caused the merchants to become rich. In some languages it is necessary or more natural to put the cause first. For example:

> Her luxurious wealth has made the merchants of the earth rich (GW)

> Because of her desires for extravagant luxury, the merchants of the world have grown rich. (NLT)

#### 18:4a

**Then I heard another voice from heaven say:**

* ¶ Then I heard someone else in heaven say,
* ¶ Then I heard from heaven another being’s voice talking/coming. It said,

**I heard another voice from heaven say:** The angel (18:1a) stopped speaking in 18:3c. Now John heard someone else speaking. The speaker was probably someone speaking on God’s behalf. Use a word or phrase that can refer to anyone in heaven. For example:

> I heard someone else speaking from heaven. He said

> I heard another person/being say from heaven on God’s behalf

**heaven:** Here the word *heaven* refers to the place where God lives.

#### 18:4b

**“Come out of her, My people,**

* “My people, leave her/it,
* “My people, come out of that city,

**Come out of her, My people:** The phrase *My people* indicates to whom the voice was speaking. In some languages it is more natural to have this phrase at the beginning of the speech. For example:

> My people, come out of her

**Come out of her:** This command warns believers to leave Babylon before the beast and the ten kings (17:16\) destroy the city. But the warning is spoken after the angel describes Babylon as being destroyed (17:16, 18:2\). So you may want to explain that in a footnote. An example footnote is:

> This command warns believers to flee before Babylon is destroyed.

**My people:** This phrase refers to believers.

**My:** This word refers to God. These were God’s people. The voice was telling them God’s message.

#### 18:4c

**so that you will not share in her sins**

* so that you will not participate in her sins (NASB)
* so that you(plur) will not be involved in her sins,

**so that you will not share in her sins:** The phrase *so that* introduces the purpose for the believers to leave the city. The believers should leave to make sure that they do not follow her sinful ways. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> you do not take part in her sins (NRSV)

> you will not participate in her sins (NASB)

**share:** Here the Greek word refers to doing something with someone as he is doing it. God does not want believers to follow Babylon and sin as she does. For example:

> participate (NASB)

#### 18:4d

**or contract any of her plagues.**

* and so that you will not receive any of her disasters,
* so that you will not suffer any of her plagues.

**or contract any of her plagues:** The conjunction *or* introduces another purpose for the believers to leave the city. If believers stay in the city, they might suffer the plagues that God will send upon her. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> so that you do not suffer any of her plagues

> you must not share in her punishment (GNT)

**her plagues:** The word *plagues* refers to disasters that harm a lot of people. It can refer to diseases that kill many people. It can refer to locusts that damage many crops. Here the word probably refers to Babylon’s suffering in 17:16\.

Some languages do not have a general word such as *plagues*. If that is true in your language, you may need to use a descriptive phrase. For example:

> things that cause her people to suffer

> things that cause much death in her

See how you translated the word *plagues* in 6:8 or 15:1\.

#### 18:5a

**For her sins are piled up to heaven,**

* for her sins are stacked as high as heaven,
* Because her sins are as numerous as if their stack/pile reached to heaven.

**For:** This conjunction introduces the reason for the warning in 18:4\.

**her sins are piled up to heaven:** This clause indicates figuratively that Babylon has sinned many times. Her many sins are like a huge pile of something. The pile is so high that it reaches heaven. The clause implies that her sins are numerous and obvious to God. Now he will wait no longer but will punish Babylon for her sins.

In some languages it is not natural to talk about piling or stacking sins. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Translate the literal meaning and explain it in a footnote. For example:

    > This saying is a figure of speech. It pictures Babylon’s sins as a huge pile of something that is as high as heaven.

* Translate this clause as a simile. For example:

    > her sins are very, very many, like rocks piled up to heaven

* Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:

    > she has very, very many sins

    > her sins are beyond counting *You may then want to explain the literal Greek words in a footnote. An example footnote is:*

    > Literally: “her sins are piled up to heaven.” This saying pictures Babylon’s sins as like something piled up to heaven.

**heaven:** The Greek word can mean *heaven* or “sky.” There are two ways to interpret this word:

1. The word means heaven here. For example:

    > heaven (RSV) *(BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, REB, ESV, KJV)*

2. The word means sky here. For example:

    > sky (NJB) *(NJB, NABRE, NCV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).Beale (page 900\) and Aune (page 992\) support interpretation (1\).

#### 18:5b

**and God has remembered her iniquities.**

* and God has thought again upon her unrighteous deeds.
* God is now ready to do something about her wicked/wrongful deeds.

**remembered:** This word indicates that God thought again about the evil deeds of Babylon. God had not forgotten about these deeds, but had chosen not to punish her until this time.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly imply that God had forgotten about her evil deeds but then later remembered them. If that is true in your language, translate so that it does not imply that God forgot. For example:

> taken notice of

> now paid attention to

> did not forget

**iniquities:** The Greek word is literally “unrighteous deeds.” It refers to deeds that God said were wrong to do. Other ways to translate this word are:

> crimes (NIV)

> wicked ways (GNT)

#### 18:6a–7a

In 18:6–7a the speaker now urged someone to punish Babylon. It is not clear to whom the voice spoke. He used four different commands. Two commands urge them to give her a punishment that is equal to her sin. Two commands urge them to give her double the punishment. The four commands together urge them to fully and completely punish Babylon.

The four commands are all addressed to more than one person or being. If you must say to whom the speaker is speaking, use a general plural word. For example:

> You, (plur) give back to her….

#### 18:6a

**Give back to her as she has done to others;**

* Repay her the same way she repaid others, (NET)
* Pay her back as she herself has paid you(plur) and others back.

**Give back to her as she has done to others:** The Greek clause is literally “Reward her as she also rewarded (you/others).” The context indicates that Babylon had done bad things, and these people were to do bad things to her in return. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> Pay her back even as she has paid (NASB)

> Do to her as she has done to others (NLT)

> Give back to her as she has given (NIV)

#### 18:6b

**pay her back double for what she has done;**

* and repay her double according to her deeds.
* Indeed, pay her back with double the punishment for her deeds.

**pay her back double for what she has done:** The Greek clause is literally “double the double according to her deeds.” It refers to punishing Babylon twice as much as she deserved for the evil deeds she did. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> repay her double for her deeds (RSV)

> Double her penalty for all her evil deeds (NLT)

> indeed, double the punishment for her deeds

#### 18:6c

**mix her a double portion in her own cup.**

* In the cup in which she mixed, mix(plur) twice as much for her.
* She mixed a cup of terror/evil and gave it to others, so give to her two cups of her own mixture.
* She did a vast amount of evil deeds to others. So do twice as many of those evil deeds to her.

**mix her a double portion in her own cup:** This clause refers figuratively to punishing Babylon by doing twice the evil to her. It commands the people to do what she had done to others, but twice as much. For example:

> in the cup which she has mixed, mix twice as much for her (NASB)

In some languages a literal translation would not have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Translate the literal meaning and explain its figurative meaning in a footnote. For example:

    > This saying refers figuratively to people punishing Babylon by doing what she had done to others, but twice as much.

* Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:

    > Punish her in the same ways that she did bad things to others, but punish her twice as much *You may then want to indicate the literal meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:*

    > Literally: “in the cup which she has mixed, mix twice as much for her.”

* Explain the figurative meaning in your translation. For example:

    > Punish her in the same ways that she did bad things to others, but give to her as if twice as much in her cup

**mix her:** At the time wine was often mixed with water and spices before drinking. There are several ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as *mix*:

1. It refers to mixing two or more liquids together. For example, the RSV says:

    > mix…for her *(BSB, RSV, NIV, NASB, ESV, NET)*

2. It refers to pouring something into a cup. For example, the GNT says:

    > Fill her cup *(GNT, KJV, NABRE, NIV11\)*

3. It refers to giving something. For example, the GW says:

    > Give her *(GW, REB)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because the lexicons support it.Only the L\&N have “pour” as a sense of the Greek word, but it lists this verse under the sense of “mix.” Beale, Aune, Hughes, Lenski, Smalley, and Kistemaker also support interpretation (1\).

The word *mix* refers here to getting the portion ready for the woman to drink. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> prepare (NCV)

> make

**her:** The BSB omits the word “for” in a natural English style. In many languages, this word must be explicit. For example, the RSV says:

> for her

**a double portion:** There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as *a double portion*:

1. It refers to twice as much liquid (twice as much wine and water mixed together). For example, the NET says:

    > double the amount *(BSB, RSV, NIV, NASB, NABRE, ESV, NLT, GW, CEV, NET)*

2. It refers to twice as much wine but the same amount of water. For example, the GNT says:

    > twice as strong *(GNT, NJB, REB, NCV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because of the connection to the amount of her sins in 18:5 and “pay her back double” in 18:6b.Aune, Lenski, Osbourne, and Smalley also support interpretation (1\).

### Section 18:1–24: Announcements/Messages about Babylon

In this section, three heavenly beings each announce something about Babylon. The first announcement is that the city is destroyed. Her riches and prosperity have been taken away.

The second announcement is that God’s people should leave Babylon before God destroys her. It also describes how kings and others mourn over the destroyed city.

The third announcement is that Babylon will never be built again.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> An angel announced that Babylon was destroyed, and some groups are sad

> Announcements about the destruction of Babylon

> Various people talk about Babylon

#### 18:7a–b

In 18:6a, the speaker urged his listeners to punish Babylon equal to the harm she had done to others. Here in 18:7a–b the speaker urged them to punish Babylon equal to the glory and luxury that she had given to herself.

**As much as she has glorified herself and lived in luxury, give her the same measure of torment and grief:** The speaker asked his listeners to make her suffering of equal measure to the glory and luxury that she had given to herself. However, in some languages a verb other than *give* must be used for the correct meaning. For example:

> Measure out torment and grief to match her pomp and luxury! (REB)

> Punish her with torture and grief as great as the glory and luxury she took for herself!

> See the quantity of her glory and her luxury that she provided/bought for herself? Make the quantity of her torture and grief equal to that.

The BSB reverses the order of the two Greek clauses. See the General Comment at the end of 18:7b.

#### 18:7a

**As much as she has glorified herself and lived in luxury,**

* As she glorified herself and lived in luxury,
* As much as she exalted herself and bought many fancy/expensive things for herself,

**as she has glorified herself:** The Greek verb that the BSB translates as *glorified* is related to the word “glory.” Glory refers to brightness. It symbolizes greatness, power, splendor, and majesty. Babylon was proud and wanted everyone to admire her and be impressed by her greatness. Other ways to translate this word are:

> as the glory…she gave herself (NIV11\)

> majesty

**lived in luxury:** The Greek word here refers to things that satisfy sensual desires. See how you translated the word “luxury” in 18:3\.

#### 18:7b

**give her the same measure of torment and grief.**

* to the same amount torment her and cause her grief.
* cause her suffering/pain and grieving just as much.

**give her…torment:** This phrase refers to causing someone to suffer and feel pain. Other ways to translate this word are:

> cause pain

> Give…torture (NIV84\)

> make suffer

See how you translated this phrase in 9:5\.

**grief:** This word here refers to the distress someone feels when suffering greatly. For example:

> agony (NJB)

##### **General Comment on 18:7a–b**

The Greek has the basis (18:7a) before the command (18:7b), as reflected in the BSB. Some English versions reverse this order. For example:

> Give her as much torment and grief as the glory and luxury she gave herself (NIV11\)

In some languages it is necessary or more natural to have the basis first, as modeled by the BSB.

#### 18:7c

**In her heart she says,**

* For she proudly says in her heart,
* For she treasures this thought:

18:7c begins with the conjunction often translated as “because.” The conjunction introduces the reason for the speaker urging his listeners to punish her. For example:

> For (GNT)

**In her heart she says:** Here the phrase *In her heart* refers to what the woman truly thinks. It indicates that 18:7d–e is her great desire. Use the usual word or phrase that is used in your language to indicate the origin of thoughts, desires, purposes, and intentions. It might be a different organ such as “liver,” or it might be a general word such as “insides.” Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> she boasts to herself in her mind

> she proudly thinks deep inside

**says:** The BSB literally represents the Greek here. But the words of 18:7d–e are boastful, so some English versions use the word “boasts” here, as in the NIV.

#### 18:7d

**‘I sit as queen;**

* ‘Here I sit, a queen! (GNT)
* ‘I am queen here on my throne.

**I sit as queen:** This clause indicates that the woman had great authority, like a queen. She was proud of her powerful position. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> Here I sit, a queen! (GNT)

> I am enthroned as queen (NJB)

#### 18:7e

**I am not a widow and will never see grief.’**

* I am not helpless/destitute like a widow. I will never suffer!’
* I am not dependent on others, and I will never grieve.’

**I am not a widow:** The word *widow* is a metaphor here. The woman claimed she would not be like a woman who has lost her husband. She boasted that she would not be left without anyone to take care of her or that she could take care of herself. Many English versions translate this clause literally. For example:

> I am no widow (NJB)

In some languages a literal translation would not have the figurative meaning above. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Translate the literal meaning and explain its figurative meaning in a footnote. For example:

    > The woman claims she will never be helpless and dependent on others, as widows often were when John wrote this book.

* Translate the metaphor as a simile. For example:

    > I am not like a widow

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > I am not helpless like a widow

    > I am not dependent on others like a widow

* Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:

    > I am not helpless

    > I am not dependent on others *You may then want to include a footnote to indicate the literal meaning. For example:*

    > Literally: “I am not a widow.”

**see grief:** This word is the same Greek word that the BSB translates as “grief” in 18:7b. You may want to translate it with the same word here.

### Section 18:1–24: Announcements/Messages about Babylon

In this section, three heavenly beings each announce something about Babylon. The first announcement is that the city is destroyed. Her riches and prosperity have been taken away.

The second announcement is that God’s people should leave Babylon before God destroys her. It also describes how kings and others mourn over the destroyed city.

The third announcement is that Babylon will never be built again.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> An angel announced that Babylon was destroyed, and some groups are sad

> Announcements about the destruction of Babylon

> Various people talk about Babylon

#### 18:8a

**Therefore her plagues will come in one day—**

* Therefore her disasters will all come in one day,
* So these plagues will happen to her in a single day:

**her plagues will come:** The BSB literally represents the Greek here. This clause indicates that Babylon will suffer from these plagues. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> she will experience her plagues (NET)

> she will be struck with plagues (GNT)

> plagues shall strike her (REB)

The plagues are listed in 18:8b. The BSB indicates the list of plagues follows by using a long dash (—) at the end of 18:8a. The NIV indicates that by using a colon.

**plagues:** Here the word *plagues* refers to “death and grief and famine” (18:8b). In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate only sicknesses. If that is true in your language, use a word that can refer to death, mourning, and famine. For example:

> disasters

**in one day:** God will punish her with all the plagues *in one day*. This phrase also implies that the plagues will be sudden.

#### 18:8b

**death and grief and famine—**

* that is, death, grief, and famine.
* death, great sorrow, and widespread hunger.

**death and grief and famine:** This phrase is a list of Babylon’s plagues (18:8a). Clearly indicate that *death and grief and famine* are her plagues. For example:

> namely, death, mourning, and famine

The BSB uses punctuation as described in the previous note.

**death:** There are several ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as *death*:

1. The Greek word here has its literal meaning of death. For example:

    > death (NLT) *(BSB, NIV, NLT, GW, CEV, NCV, ESV, KJV)*

2. The Greek word here means fatal disease. For example:

    > pestilence (RSV) *(RSV, NASB, NABRE, REB)*

3. The Greek word here refers to disease in general. For example:

    > disease (GNT) *(GNT, NJB, NET)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because that is the usual meaning of the Greek word.Swete (page 231\) and Lenski (page 521\) support interpretation (1\). But the Greek word may figuratively refer to things that lead to death, probably fatal diseases. See Smalley (155\).

**grief:** This word is the same Greek word that the BSB translates as “grief” in 18:7b. You may want to translate it with the same word here.

**famine:** This word refers to an extreme shortage of food. During a famine, people die from hunger.

#### 18:8c

**and she will be consumed by fire,**

* She will be burned to ashes,
* Fire will completely burn her,

**she will be consumed by fire:** This clause indicates that a fire will burn Babylon completely. The clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> Fire will burn her to ashes

> They will completely burn her

**consumed:** Here the word *consumed* indicates that Babylon will be completely burned by fire.

#### 18:8d

**for mighty is the Lord God who judges her.”**

* because the Lord God, the one who judges her, is mighty/powerful.
* for the Lord God is mighty/powerful. He is the one who judges her and has punished her in those ways.

**for:** This conjunction introduces the reason why Babylon will be consumed by fire.

**mighty is the Lord God who judges her:** The BSB and some English versions have the description (the adjective *mighty*) before the one described. This is an English poetic style. In some languages it is more natural to have the description after. For example:

> the Lord God, who judges her, is mighty (GNT)

**mighty:** This word not only refers to physical strength, but probably also to great authority. God has both the power and authority to judge Babylon.

**the Lord God who judges her:** The clause *who judges her* tells the reader more about God. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other gods and only this one *judges her*. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about God. For example:

> the Lord God. He judges her.

> her judge is the…Lord God (CEV)

**Lord:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Lord* means “the one who has authority over (others),” or “owner.” God has authority over everyone. See how you translated this word in 4:8 or 17:14\.

**judges her:** The word *judges* refers to deciding if someone is guilty or innocent of wrongdoing. The context implies that the Lord judged Babylon to be guilty. So he punished her with death, mourning, and famine (18:8b).

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate only that God judged her, but he did not punish her. If that is true in your language, include some of the implied information. For example:

> judges/judged her in that way

> judges/judged her and punished her with those plagues

## Revelation 18:9 (id: 523228)

### Section 18:1–24: Announcements/Messages about Babylon

In this section, three heavenly beings each announce something about Babylon. The first announcement is that the city is destroyed. Her riches and prosperity have been taken away.

The second announcement is that God’s people should leave Babylon before God destroys her. It also describes how kings and others mourn over the destroyed city.

The third announcement is that Babylon will never be built again.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> An angel announced that Babylon was destroyed, and some groups are sad

> Announcements about the destruction of Babylon

> Various people talk about Babylon

#### 18:9–20

The Greek does not clearly indicate when the voice from heaven (18:4a) stopped speaking. There are two ways to interpret who spoke or wrote 18:9–20:

1. The voice continued to speak here. The voice continued describing what will happen. *(NIV, NJB, NASB, GW)*
2. The voice stopped speaking at the end of 18:8d. John then saw the events of 18:9–20 and wrote about them. *(BSB, RSV, GNT, NABRE, NLT, CEV, NET, REB, NCV, ESV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because the future tense continues from 18:8\.Beale (page 905\), Swete (page 231\), and Caird (pages 224–225\) support interpretation (1\). So 18:9–20 are events that the voice told John about, just like 18:4–8\.

Indicate that the voice continues speaking. In some languages introducing the quote again is necessary or more clear. For example:

> The voice continued, “When the kings…

> That person in heaven spoke further saying, “When the kings…

> That person’s voice continued speaking from heaven, saying, “When the kings…

#### 18:9a–b

**Then the kings of the earth who committed sexual immorality and lived in luxury with her will weep and wail at the sight of the smoke rising from the fire that consumes her:** The kings’ actions are described in two ways here:

1. they *committed sexual immorality…with her*,
2. they *lived in luxury with her*.

What the kings actually did *at the sight of the smoke* is not written until after these descriptions. Your translation should make it clear that (a) and (b) above describe the customary deeds of the kings. You should not translate it as something they only did at this time. For example:

> Regarding the kings of the earth who had committed adultery with her and shared her luxury, when they see the smoke

> When the kings of the earth who had been committing adultery with her and sharing her luxury now see the smoke

#### 18:9a

**Then the kings of the earth who committed sexual immorality**

* ¶ When the kings of the earth who were committing sexual sin together with her
* ¶ The leaders of the world’s nations had been sinning sexually with her
* ¶ The voice continued, “The kings of the earth regularly/always committed adultery with her

**the kings of the earth:** This phrase refers to the leaders of nations around the earth.

**who committed sexual immorality:** This clause probably symbolizes the kings as joining Babylon in sinning against God. See how you translated this clause at 17:2 or 18:3\.

In some languages a literal translation would not indicate the symbolic meaning of *committed sexual immorality*. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain in a footnote. For example:

> This saying is probably symbolic of joining Babylon in sinning against God.

But if you already have a footnote at 17:2a or 18:3b, you may not want to repeat the footnote here.

#### 18:9b

**and lived in luxury with her**

* and living with her in luxury
* and had been enjoying her fancy/expensive things.
* and shared her luxurious life.

**lived in luxury with her:** The BSB literally represents the Greek here. The kings satisfied their sensual desires together with her. This would include things like rare perfumes, wearing expensive clothing, and eating fancy foods.

**luxury:** The Greek word here refers to things that satisfy sensual desires. See how you translated this word in 18:7\.

#### 18:9c

**will weep and wail at the sight of the smoke rising from the fire that consumes her.**

* see the smoke of her burning, they will cry … what happened to her.
* They will weep and have great sorrow about/over her when they see the smoke of the fire burning her.

**weep:** This word refers to tears that flow from the eyes because of great sadness. Here the word may also refer to the sounds people make when crying. But it probably does not refer to the loud noise of wailing here.

**wail:** This word refers to sounds people make when they are grieving. The kings will mourn because they will no longer be able to enjoy Babylon’s luxury and immoral life. Other ways to translate this word are:

> grieve

> have great sorrow

**the smoke rising from the fire that consumes her:** This phrase refers to the enemies of Babylon setting fire to her (18:8c). In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that she was burning something. If that is true in your language, make the correct meaning clear. For example:

> the smoke from the fire that burns her (NET)

> the smoke from the flames that consume her (GNT)

#### 18:10a

**In fear of her torment, they will stand at a distance and cry out:**

* Being frightened at her torment and therefore standing far away, they will say,
* They will be so afraid of how much she is suffering that they will stand at a great distance from her. Full of grief/sadness they will say,

**In fear of her torment, they will stand at a distance:** The Greek words indicate that the kings stood far away because they were afraid of Babylon’s torment. They did not want that torment to also happen to them. Other ways to translate these words are:

> standing at a distance because of the fear of her torment (NASB)

> while they keep at a safe distance through fear of her anguish (NJB)

**torment:** This word refers to much hurt and pain. The Greek word is the same word as “torment” in 18:7b. But the context here refers to feeling hurt and pain rather than causing hurt and pain. Other ways to translate this word are:

> anguish (NJB)

> suffering (GNT)

**cry out:** The Greek word is literally “say” (as in the RSV). The BSB uses the words *cry out* with the meaning of “speak with much emotion.”

#### 18:10b

**“Woe, woe to the great city, the mighty city of Babylon!**

* “Babylon, great city, city of power! How terrible, so terrible for you!
* ‘O great and powerful city Babylon, there is great and terrible trouble for you!
* :Babylon, that important/famous and strong city. Such a great disaster happened to her/it!

**Woe, woe to the great city, the mighty city of Babylon!:** There are two ways to interpret how Babylon was addressed:

1. The speakers addressed Babylon directly. For example:

    > Alas! Alas! You great city, you mighty city, Babylon! (ESV) *(BSB, RSV, NIV, NABRE, REB, NET, NLT, ESV, NCV)*

2. The speakers spoke about Babylon here. For example:

    > How terrible! How awful! This great and mighty city Babylon! (GNT) *(GNT, NJB, NASB, NRSV, GW, CEV, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because the next sentence was spoken to Babylon.Aune (page 997\) clearly supports interpretation (1\). Others are less clear but probably support interpretation (1\). For example, Osbourne translates 18:10b–c as “Woe, woe, great city, Babylon, mighty city, because in one hour your judgment has come.”

However, in some languages it is not natural to address a city directly. If that is true in your language, you may want to follow interpretation (2\).

In some languages it is more natural to say first whom the speakers are addressing. For example:

> to the great city, the mighty city of Babylon, woe, woe!

> the great city, the mighty city of Babylon, woe, woe to it!

**Woe, woe:** The word *Woe* is repeated to emphasize its meaning. But in some languages it is more natural not to repeat the word. If that is true in your language, you should emphasize the *woe* in a natural way. For example:

> Great woe indeed!

**Woe:** The Greek word here means “There will be trouble for (someone).” The word indicates sorrow about the troubles. Other ways to translate this word are:

> How terrible (GNT)

> Alas (RSV)

> Such great trouble for

See how you translated this word in 8:13\.

#### 18:10c

**For in a single hour your judgment has come.”**

* In one hour your(sing) judgment has occurred/happened!”
* In one hour you have been fully punished!”
* Her/Its great punishment was sudden, and all of it occurred so quickly!”

**a single hour:** Here the phrase *a single hour* refers to a short time, not necessarily a literal hour. It implies suddenness. Babylon did not expect God to come and judge her. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> a very short time

> quickly and suddenly

**your judgment has come:** This clause indicates that Babylon has been punished as God judged that she should be. In some languages it is more natural to use a different verb than *come*. For example:

> your judgment has occurred/happened

You may have translated “O great city, O Babylon, city of power” following interpretation (2\) above. If that is true in your language, you may want to do the same here. For example:

> her judgment has come

**judgment:** Here the Greek word that the BSB translates as *judgment* means that God judged Babylon to be deserving of death, mourning, and famine (18:8b). Other ways to translate this word are:

> condemnation

> punishment (NCV)

In some languages it is necessary or more natural to use a verb here. For example:

> God has judged/condemned you

> you have been punished (GNT)

**And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her,**

* ¶ The merchants of the earth will cry tears and grieve regarding what happened to her,
* ¶ The sellers around the world will weep and have great sorrow about her,

**merchants:** This word refers to those who buy, sell, and trade as their job. See how you translated this word in 18:3\.

**weep:** This word refers to great sadness that causes tears in the eyes. Here the word may also refer to the noise people make when crying. But it probably does not refer to the loud noise of wailing.

**mourn:** This word refers to being very sad and grieving. See how you translated this word in 18:9, where the BSB translates it as “wail.”

#### 18:11b

**because there is no one left to buy their cargo—**

* because no one buys their goods/cargoes any longer;
* because there are no longer any customers to buy what they sell.

**because:** This conjunction introduces the reason for the merchants’ sorrow.

**no one left to buy:** This phrase indicates that no one in Babylon will buy what the merchants have to sell.

**cargo:** This word refers generally to things that merchants sell. Some of the kinds of cargo are listed in 18:12–13\. For example:

> goods (GNT)

#### 18:12a–13d

These verses list different cargoes that the merchants were selling. In some languages it is more natural to translate this long list using several sentences. If that is true in your language, you may need to add a verb or introductory phrase at the beginning of each sentence. See the second meaning line in the Display.

#### 18:12a

**cargo of gold, silver, precious stones, and pearls;**

* goods of gold, silver, jewels, and pearls,
* No one buys their gold, silver, valuable stones, beautiful pearls,

**gold:** The word *gold* refers to a rare metal of a somewhat yellow color. It was the most expensive metal at that time. It is naturally shiny and beautiful. See how you translated this word in 1:12 or 17:4\.

**silver:** The word *silver* refers to somewhat expensive metal, though it is not as rare and expensive as gold. When polished, it was used as a mirror. It was used in coins and decorations. See how you translated this word in 9:20\.

**precious stones:** This phrase refers to rare stones that are naturally beautiful or become beautiful when shaped and polished. These rare stones are *precious* or expensive. See how you translated this word in 17:4\.

**pearls:** The word *pearls* refers to hard, shiny spheres found in the shellfish called oysters. The spheres are often very beautiful. Good ones are very valuable. See how you translated this word in 17:4\.

#### 18:12b

**of fine linen, purple, silk, and scarlet; of all kinds of citron wood**

* beautiful linen cloth, purple cloth, silk cloth, scarlet cloth, all kinds of citron wood,
* their expensive cloth made from flax, their purple cloth, their silk cloth, their bright red cloth, or their expensive/fragrant hardwood called citron.

**fine linen:** Here the word *fine* indicates that the *linen* was of very good quality. Natural linen is tan, gray, or the color of ivory. It can be bleached white. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> high quality linen clothing

> very good linen clothing

> expensive linen clothing

**linen:** This word refers to expensive cloth made from a plant called flax. The cloth is smooth and strong yet soft.

In some languages people are not familiar with *linen*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain this word in your translation. For example:

    > flax cloth

    > smooth cloth

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. Here are example footnotes:

    > Linen is an expensive cloth made from a plant called flax. The cloth is smooth and strong yet soft.

    > See footnote on linen at 15:6\.

**purple:** Purple cloth was very expensive at that time because the dye used to make purple cloth was very difficult to get. You may want to explain its value in your translation. For example:

> expensive purple cloth

**silk:** This word refers to a cloth made from the threads of silkworm cocoons. The cloth is soft, shiny, and expensive.

In some languages people are not familiar with *silk*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain this cloth in your translation. For example:

    > beautiful silk cloth

    > expensive shiny cloth

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Silk is a cloth made from the threads of silkworm cocoons. The cloth is soft, shiny, and expensive.

**scarlet:** This word refers to cloth of a bright red color. It was less expensive than purple cloth.

**citron wood:** The phrase *citron wood* refers to a hardwood with a pleasant smell. It is used to make furniture.

In some languages people are not familiar with *citron wood*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain this wood in your translation. For example:

    > good smelling citron wood

    > expensive/valuable and fragrant hardwood

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. For example:

    > Citron wood is a hardwood that has a pleasant smell that is used to make furniture.

#### 18:12c

**and every article of ivory, precious wood, bronze, iron, and marble;**

* things made of ivory, expensive wood, bronze, iron, and marble,
* No one buys their ornamental/expensive things made of animal tusks, rare woods, bronze metal, iron metal, and variegated stone.

**ivory:** The word *ivory* refers to pieces of the tusks (very big teeth) of elephants, walruses, and other animals. It is creamy white and hard. It is often carved into various shapes.

In some languages people are not familiar with *ivory*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain *ivory* in your translation. For example:

    > large pieces of animal teeth

    > animal tusks

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Ivory comes from the tusks of elephants, walruses, and other animals. It is creamy white and hard. It is often carved into various shapes.

**bronze:** This word refers to a metal made from a mixture of copper and tin. The Greek word also refers to pure copper or brass. (Brass is a mixture of copper and zinc.) The metal called *bronze* is a yellowish\-brown color. Copper is a reddish\-brown metal color. Some kinds of coins are made of *bronze* or copper. (The other common color of coins is silver.)

In some languages people are not familiar with *bronze*, copper, or brass. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the word in your translation. For example:

    > brown/tan metal called bronze

    > reddish brown metal called copper

* Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > brown/tan metal

    > reddish brown metal

* Use the major language word.

See how you translated this word in 1:15 or 9:20\.

**iron:** This word refers to a hard metal. It was the strongest metal known at that time. Good quality weapons and many other things were made of *iron*.

In some languages people are not familiar with *iron*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain *iron* in a footnote. (But if you have a footnote about *iron* at 12:5b, you may not want to repeat it here.) For example:

    > Iron is a hard metal. It was the strongest metal known at that time.

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, you may want to explain it in a footnote as above.
* Describe it in your translation. For example:

    > hard metal

See how you translated this word in 9:9 or 12:5\.

**marble:** This word refers to a kind of stone. It is somewhat hard. It is often white or gray with other colors scattered throughout the stone in irregular lines or spots. It is very beautiful when polished, and can be carved into various shapes.

In some languages people are not familiar with *marble*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the word in your translation. For example:

    > veined stone called marble

    > variegated stone

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Marble is a stone with irregular lines of another color spread throughout the stone. Marble is very beautiful when polished, and it can be carved into various shapes.

#### 18:13a

**of cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, and frankincense;**

* cargoes of cinnamon, India spice, incense, myrrh, and frankincense,
* No one buys their cinnamon spice, black cardamom spice, sweet smelling incense, sweet smelling myrrh, and sweet smelling frankincense.

**cinnamon:** This word refers to a spice made from the inner bark of cinnamon trees. In some languages people are not familiar with *cinnamon*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the word in your translation. For example:

    > spice called cinnamon

    > cinnamon spice

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. For example:

    > Cinnamon is a spice made from the inner bark of cinnamon trees.

**spice:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *spice* refers to the extract from a plant of India called amomum. This is probably the spice that is today called black cardamom.

In some languages people are not familiar with amomum or cardamom. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain that it is a spice. For example:

    > cardamom spice

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > This word refers to a spice which comes from a plant called amomum.

**incense:** The word *incense* refers to the dried sap of certain kinds of trees. The dried sap burns slowly to make a sweet\-smelling smoke. Incense is often used as a part of worship.

In some languages people are not familiar with *incense*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the word in your translation. For example:

    > special tree resin/sap called incense burned to give/release a sweet smell

    > sweet smelling tree resin/sap called incense

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. For example:

    > Incense is the dried sap of certain trees. The dried sap burns slowly to make a sweet\-smelling smoke. People often burned incense as part of their worship.

See how you translated this word in 5:8\.

**myrrh:** The word *myrrh* refers to a product from the sap of the myrrh bush. People use it to make a highly valued ointment and perfume.

In some languages people are not familiar with *myrrh*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the word in your translation. For example:

    > myrrh bush sap made into perfume

    > sweet smelling bush sap called myrrh

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Myrrh comes from the sap of the myrrh bush. People use it to make a highly valued ointment and perfume.

**frankincense:** The word *frankincense* refers to a product from the sap of several kinds of trees. People dry the sap, grind it into a powder, then burn it to make a good\-smelling smoke. It can also be an ingredient in perfume.

In some languages people are not familiar with *frankincense*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the word in your translation. For example:

    > tree resin/sap burned for a sweet smell called frankincense

    > sweet/good smelling tree resin/sap called frankincense

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Frankincense comes from the sap of several kinds of trees. People dry the sap and burn it during worship in order to make a sweet smelling smoke. Or they add it to perfume.

#### 18:13b

**of wine, olive oil, fine flour, and wheat;**

* wine, olive oil, high quality flour, wheat,
* No one buys their alcoholic beverages, cooking oil, quality flour, and quality wheat.

**wine:** Wine is an alcoholic beverage made from the juice of grapes. In some languages people are not familiar with *wine*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain it in your translation. For example:

    > alcoholic beverage of wine

    > an alcoholic beverage made from grapes, called wine

* Use the name of the common alcoholic beverage in your area. You may then want a footnote to explain the literal word. For example:

    > Literally: “wine.”

See how you translated this word in 14:8 or 17:2\.

**olive oil:** The *olive* is a small oval fruit. People squeeze the *oil* out of it. The *oil* is used as cooking oil and as fuel for lamps.

**fine flour:** The Greek word here refers to the best quality of flour. For example:

> high quality flour

> the best flour

**wheat:** The word *wheat* refers to a grain plant commonly grown in that part of the world. It was more expensive than barley. Poor people bought barley. So this word implies that the people of Babylon were wealthy.

#### 18:13c

**of cattle, sheep, horses, and chariots;**

* cattle, sheep, horses, carriages/wagons,
* No one buys their animals of burden, wool animals, riding animals, four\-wheeled vehicles,

**cattle:** This word refers to large animals that were used for work. They carried loads, pulled plows, and did other hard work for people.

In some languages people are not familiar with *cattle*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the word in your translation. For example:

    > strong/pulling animals

    > large farm/pack animals

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Cattle are large farm animals that can pull heavy loads. People eat their meat and drink their milk.

**sheep:** The word *sheep* refers to smaller farm animals. They usually stay in groups. They weigh 40 to 60 kilograms. They eat plants. Here people probably bought *sheep* for their wool and meat.

In some languages people are not familiar with *sheep*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the word in your translation. For example:

    > woolly animals called sheep

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > This word refers to a medium\-sized farm animal. People use their hair to make cloth and eat their meat.

**horses:** A horse is a large, four\-legged animal that weighs 500 kilograms (1100 pounds) or more. They are about 1\.5 meters (5 feet) high at their back. People ride horses.

In some languages people are not familiar with *horses*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the word in your translation. For example:

    > riding animals called horses

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > A horse is a large animal that a person can ride. The person could direct the horse to go where he wanted.

See how you translated this word in 6:2 or 14:20\.

**chariots:** This word refers to four\-wheeled vehicles pulled by horses, like a “carriage.” The wheels were made of wood. The Greek word could refer to:

1. Vehicles made to carry people comfortably. These *chariots* or “carriages” (NIV11\) had seats and were usually covered to protect the people from rain.
2. Vehicles made to carry heavy loads.

Use a word or phrase that refers to either one or both meanings.

#### 18:13d

**of slaves and souls of men.**

* slaves, and even human lives. (GNT)
* slaves, and the lives of people.

**slaves and souls of men:** The BSB translates the Greek words literally. There are two interpretation issues. These words can refer to people in general or to slaves. Also, they can refer to one group or two groups. The main interpretations are:

1. The words refers to two groups of people. The word *slaves* refers to slaves. The phrase *souls of men* refers to another group of people. The second group might be prisoners of war. For example:

    > slaves, and even human lives (GNT) *(GNT, NJB, NRSV, NASB, CEV, NET, REB, NCV, KJV)*

2. The words refers to slaves as one group of people. It uses two similar phrases to emphasize the meaning. For example:

    > slaves, that is, human souls (RSV) *(RSV, NLT, NABRE, GW, ESV)*

The BSB is ambiguous. It is recommended that you also translate ambiguously, if possible. But if that is not possible, then follow option (1\).The Translator’s Handbook (on TW) and the IVP Bible Background Commentary (on TW) say that the two phrases refer to slaves and captives from war. Romans used captives from war in fights to the death in the gladiatorial games. But Beale (page 910\) and Aune (page 1002\) support interpretation (2\).

#### 18:14a–b

**And they will say: “The fruit of your soul’s desire has departed from you; all your luxury and splendor have vanished, never to be seen again.”:** The BSB adds the words “And they will say” and quote marks to the beginning of 18:14a. However, the Greek does not introduce a new speaker here. There are several ways to interpret who said these words:

1. The voice from heaven (18:4\) continues speaking. The NASB begins this verse without any added words and does not indicate a change of speaker with a change of quote mark. For example:

    > The fruit… *(NJB, NASB, NABRE)*

2. John continues speaking. The CEV begins this verse without any added words and does not indicate a change of speaker with a change of quote mark. But the CEV indicates that the voice from heaven stopped speaking at 18:8\. For example:

    > The fruit… *(CEV, NET)*

3. The merchants spoke the words of 18:14\. The GNT adds the words “The merchants say to her,” and therefore says:

    > The merchants say to her, “All the good things… *(BSB, NIV, GNT, NLT, GW, REB, NCV)The RSV, ESV, and NLT begin this verse with double quote marks but do not indicate who spoke, so it is difficult to know whether they indicate the merchants spoke or the kings of the earth (18:9\) spoke again.*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because:

1. the Greek does not indicate or imply a change of speaker,
2. it makes little sense to have the merchants speak here (interpretation 3\), and then introduce them as speaking in the next verse,
3. the things said here are more appropriate coming from someone agreeing with God’s judgment than from the merchants mourning the loss of their best customer,
4. it seems unlikely that John (interpretation 2\) would interrupt the heavenly voice with his own prophecy here,
5. interpretation (1\) at the note on 18:9–20 recommends it.Lenski (page 523–524\) indicates in his translation that the person who introduced the merchants also spoke this verse. Charles (vol.2, page 433\) thinks that it is a heavenly voice speaking.

If people in your area will not be clear as to who spoke this verse, you may want to:

* Explain in a footnote. For example:

    > The voice from heaven continued speaking here.

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > The voice from heaven continued and said, “The fruit…

If you followed interpretation (2\) at the note on 18:9–20, you can:

* Allow the voice to speak this verse. For example:

    > The voice from heaven said, “The fruit…

* Allow John to speak this verse by not introducing who spoke or adding quote marks. The CEV and NET have John speaking. For example, the CEV says:

    > Babylon, the things…

Allowing the heavenly voice to speak seems more likely, as John mostly observes throughout the vision and does not speak unless spoken to. For this reason, the Notes will follow the NASB for 18:14a–b.

#### 18:14a

**And they will say: “The fruit of your soul’s desire has departed from you;**

* ¶ The fruit you craved is gone. (GW)
* ¶ The good/fancy things that you(sing) desired so much have left you.

**The fruit of your soul’s desire has departed from you:** The word *fruit* refers figuratively to good things that pleased or benefited the woman, the city called Babylon. She desired to have them. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> The fruit you craved is gone (GW)

> All the good things you longed to own have disappeared (GNT)

> The fancy things you loved so much are gone (NLT)

#### 18:14b

**all your luxury and splendor have vanished, never to be seen again.”**

* All of your costly/luxurious goods/items and shiny/sparkling jewelry/trinkets are destroyed and will never be found again.
* All your glamorous and glittery things are lost, and no one will ever find them again.

**luxury:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *luxury* literally means “fatty.” Here it refers figuratively to things that are luxurious and expensive. Other ways to translate this word are:

> dainties (RSV)

> all things that were luxurious (NASB)

> delicacies (ESV)

**splendor:** The Greek word here refers to something bright or shiny. Here it probably refers to shiny and expensive items like jewels, jewelry, and precious metals. Other ways to translate this word are:

> sparkling trinkets/things

> all things that were…splendid (NASB)

> all the…glamour (REB)

**have vanished:** These Greek words can be translated as “have perished from you” or “are lost to you.” It indicates that Babylon’s riches and splendor were destroyed. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> are destroyed

> are lost to you (NRSV)

**never to be seen again:** There is a textual issue with the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *never to be seen again*:

1. Some Greek manuscripts have the clause they will never find. It indicates that nobody will find the lost riches and splendor. For example:

    > never to be found again (RSV) *(BSB, RSV, NIV, NJB, NASB, NABRE, NLT, GW, NET, REB, ESV)*

2. Other Greek manuscripts have the clause you may never find. It indicates that Babylon will not find the lost riches and splendor. For example:

    > you will never find them again (GNT) *(GNT, CEV, NCV, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it.

The Greek indicates generally that no one will find Babylon’s lost riches and splendor. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> it will never again be seenWestern Bukidnon Manobo Back Translation on TW.

> No one will ever find them again (GW)

**The merchants who sold these things and grew their wealth from her**

* ¶ The merchants of those things, who became wealthy from her buying so much from them,
* ¶ The sellers who became rich selling those things to her

**The merchants who sold these things and grew their wealth from her:** The Greek words are literally “The merchants of these things, the ones having become rich from her.” It refers to the merchants in 18:11a. They sold the cargoes listed in 18:12–13\. They made a lot of profit from selling those things to her. For example:

> The merchants of these things, who became rich from her (NASB)

**grew their wealth from her:** This phrase indicates that the merchants made a lot of money from selling their cargoes to Babylon. For example:

> became rich from doing business in that city (GNT)

#### 18:15b

**will stand at a distance, in fear of her torment.**

* will stand far away because they are frightened at her torment.
* will stand at a great distance, being fearful of her agony.

**will stand at a distance, in fear of her torment:** The Greek words indicate that the merchants stood far away because they were afraid of the suffering of Babylon. They did not want the terrible things that happened to her to also happen to them. Other ways to translate these words are:

> will stand at a distance because of the fear of her torment (NASB)

> will be standing at a safe distance through fear of her anguish (NJB)

**torment:** This word refers to feeling much hurt and pain. See how you translated this word in 18:10\.

#### 18:15c

**They will weep and mourn,**

* They will cry tears and grieve regarding what happened to her
* They will weep and have great sorrow about her.

**They will weep and mourn:** This phrase has the same meaning as the same phrase in 18:11\. See how you translated it there.

#### 18:16a–b

**saying: “Woe, woe to the great city, clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet…”:** These words were probably spoken about Babylon, rather than to her. She is not addressed by the pronoun “you” in the following verses. For example:

> saying, ‘Woe, woe, the great city, she who was clothed in fine linen… (NASB)

**Woe, woe to the great city:** The words naming the thing spoken about, *the great city*, are in the middle of the sentence. Many languages must have *the great city* first for a natural sentence and place the words *Woe, woe* at the end of the sentence. Also, many languages must locate the description of that thing immediately after naming the thing spoken to. For example:

> O great city, clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls—woe, woe!

#### 18:16a

**saying: “Woe, woe to the great city,**

* and say, “How terrible, so terrible for her! Great city,
* , they will say that there is great and terrible trouble for her!

**saying:** The BSB represents the Greek literally here. Some other English versions use the phrase “and cry out” to indicate the meaning of “speak with much emotion.” That meaning is implied here. See how you translated the word “cry” in 18:10\.

**Woe, woe:** The word *Woe* is repeated to emphasize its meaning. But in some languages it is more natural not to repeat the word. If that is true in your language, you should emphasize the *woe* in a natural way. For example:

> Great woe indeed!

See how you translated this phrase in 18:10\.

**the great city:** The BSB literally represents the Greek here. Some English versions add the word “O” (as in the NIV84\). In English it probably indicates a formal address, as speaking to someone of high status. Some English versions, like the BSB, do not add this word.

**great:** The city of Babylon is called *great* because at that time it was an important and famous city. It had a vast empire and great influence. See how you translated this word in 18:2\.

#### 18:16b

**clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet,**

* clothed in beautiful linen cloth, purple cloth, and scarlet cloth,
* She was like a woman who wore expensive flaxen clothes! She was like a woman who wore purple and bright red clothes

**clothed in fine linen:** The merchants speak about Babylon as if that city is a woman *clothed in fine linen*. Earlier, John saw Babylon figuratively as a woman (17:1–18\).

In some languages it is not natural to refer to a city as a woman. If that is true in your language, you may want to change this metaphor into a simile. For example:

> she was like a woman clothed in fine linen

**fine linen:** Here the word *fine* indicates that the *linen* was very good quality. See how you translated this phrase in 18:12\.

**purple and scarlet:** This phrase refers to the colors of the cloth. Making purple and scarlet cloth was expensive at that time. For example:

> expensive purple and scarlet clothing

See how you translated the words *purple* and *scarlet* in 18:12\.

#### 18:16c

**adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls!**

* and adorned with gold, jewels, and pearls!
* decorated with gold, valuable stones, and beautiful pearls!

**adorned:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *adorned* means “wearing.” A woman wore gold, precious stones and pearls in order to look beautiful. This word may refer to jewelry or to things fastened to the dress or both. Other ways to translate this word are:

> decorated

> glittering with (NIV)

See how you translated this word in 17:4\.

**gold and precious stones and pearls:** See how you translated these words in 18:12\.

#### 18:17a

**For in a single hour such fabulous wealth has been destroyed!”**

* For in one hour so much wealth has been destroyed!”
* All that wealth has gone/disappeared so quickly.

**For:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *For* is often translated as “because.” This conjunction introduces the reason for the saying of woe in 18:16\.

**in a single hour:** Here the phrase *a single hour* refers to a short time, not necessarily a literal hour. It implies suddenness. Translate this phrase as you did in 18:10\.

**such fabulous wealth has been destroyed!:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> she has lost all this wealth (GNT)

> all the wealth of the city is gone (NLT)

Your translation should indicate or imply that the wealth was destroyed. If possible, emphasize or keep the focus on the phrase *such fabulous wealth*.

**such fabulous wealth:** The word *such* emphasizes the large amount of the wealth. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> all this wealth (RSV)

> So much wealth (REB)

**has been destroyed:** This phrase usually refers to a city or town that is destroyed and left with no people in it. Here the phrase refers to the wealth becoming valueless. All of Babylon’s beautiful things were ruined and destroyed, so they were useless. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> has been brought to ruin (NIV)

> has been laid waste (RSV)

> completely ruined

#### 18:17b

**Every shipmaster, passenger, and sailor,**

* ¶ All sea\-ship captains, sea\-ship passengers, sea ship workers,
* ¶ Every captain/leader of an ocean\-going ship, every person who travels on the ocean, every person working on a ship,

**shipmaster:** This phrase refers to the person who controls a ship. He is the leader over the people on it.

**passenger:** This phrase refers to people who pay for a ship to take them somewhere. For example:

> all who travel by ship (NIV)

**sailor:** This word refers to people who have jobs on ships while the ships are sailing on the ocean.

#### 18:17c

**and all who make their living from the sea, will stand at a distance**

* and all who gain income from their work on the sea will stand far away.
* and every other person who works on the ocean will stand at a safe distance from Babylon.

**all who make their living from the sea:** The Greek phrase is literally “all who work the sea.” It refers to those whose jobs involve the sea. It includes fishermen and traders who send goods by ship. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> as many as make their living by the sea (NASB)

> all those people whose jobs involve the sea

The captains and sailors are already mentioned in 18:17b. So this phrase refers to all of the other people who also make their living on the sea. For example, the GNT says:

> all others who earn their living on the sea

**sea:** The word *sea* refers to a large body of water. A *sea* is often so large that someone standing on one side cannot see the other side. Here the word *sea* refers to seas and oceans in general. See how you translated this word in 5:13 or 13:1\.

**will stand at a distance:** This phrase probably implies that these seafaring people stood far away because they were afraid of what was happening to Babylon (as in 18:10a). For example:

> kept a safe distance (NJB)

**and cry out at the sight of the smoke rising from the fire that consumes her.**

* When they see the smoke from where she was burned, they will shout,
* They will see the smoke of the fire that burned her and lament loudly,

**the smoke rising from the fire that consumes her:** The phrase *the fire that consumes her* refers to the beast and the ten kings burning Babylon (17:16\). The Greek grammar and the BSB have the focus on Babylon and the event of burning. The focus is not on who burned her. Here are some others way to say this:

> the smoke from the fire that burned her

> the smoke as she burned (NJB)

If possible, keep the focus on *her* and the event of burning.

#### 18:18b

**“What city was ever like this great city?” they will exclaim.**

* “How could there ever be a city greater than this one?”
* “There never was a city as important/famous as this one!”

**“What city was ever like this great city?”:** This is a rhetorical question. It emphasizes that the people of the sea think that Babylon was the greatest city in all of history. Translate this clause in a way that emphasizes that Babylon was the greatest city. Some ways to do that are:

* Use a rhetorical question. For example:

    > Has there ever been a city as great as this (NJB)

    > How could there ever be a city greater than this one?

* Use a statement. For example:

    > There never has been another city like this great city! (GNT)

**great:** The city is called *great* because it had a vast empire and great influence. The word may include the meaning of “large,” but that is not the most important meaning here.

**they will exclaim:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *exclaim* is usually translated as “cried out” (as in the RSV). The Greek word refers to speaking loudly so that many people can hear what was said. For example:

> shouted (CEV)

See how you translated this word in 6:10 or 7:10, where the BSB translates it as “cried out.”

The second announcement is that God’s people should leave Babylon before God destroys her. It also describes how kings and others mourn over the destroyed city.

The third announcement is that Babylon will never be built again.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> An angel announced that Babylon was destroyed, and some groups are sad

> Announcements about the destruction of Babylon

> Various people talk about Babylon

#### 18:19a

**Then they will throw dust on their heads**

* They will throw dust on their heads to show their sorrow,
* They will show that they are very sad

**Then they will throw dust on their heads:** This clause refers to the common way of showing grief at that time. The shipmaster, passengers, sailors, and others will mourn the loss of Babylon.

In some languages throwing dust on the head is not a sign of mourning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain its meaning in your translation. For example:

    > They will show their sadness/mourning by throwing dust on their heads

* Translate the literal meaning and explain its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Throwing dust on the head was the common way of showing grief at that time.

* Use a custom in your language that shows grief. You may then want to explain the literal words in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Literally: “They will throw dust on their heads.” At that time in that region, doing that showed grief.

* Translate the meaning of this custom. For example:

    > They will mourn

#### 18:19b

**as they weep and mourn and cry out:**

* and they will shout with tears and grief,
* and will cry and lament loudly,

**as they weep:** These words refer to tears in the eyes because of sadness. Here the words may also refer to the noise people make when crying. But it probably does not refer to the loud noise of wailing here.

**mourn:** This word refers to being very sad or grieving. The sea captains and other people will be very sad that Babylon is gone. Other ways to translate this word are:

> grieve

> have great sorrow

**cry out:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *cry out* refers to speaking loudly with a strong desire to be heard. See how you translated this word in 18:18\.

#### 18:19c

**“Woe, woe to the great city, where all who had ships on the sea were enriched by her wealth!**

* “Great city, a city so wealthy that all sea ship owners became rich by trading with her! How terrible, so terrible for her!
* “That/This great city in which sea ship owners became rich by transporting expensive goods to her! There is great and terrible trouble for her!

**Woe, woe to the great city:** These words were probably spoken about Babylon, rather than to her. She is addressed by “she” in 18:19d. For example:

> Alas, alas, that great city (KJV)

**Woe, woe:** The word *Woe* is repeated to emphasize its meaning. See how you translated this phrase in 18:16\.

**all who had ships:** This phrase refers to the people who owned ocean\-going ships. For example:

> every owner of a sea–going ship (NJB)

**were enriched by her wealth:** The word *by* indicates that the shipowners became rich because of selling things to Babylon. She bought many expensive goods. The shipowners made a lot of money from fees for bringing those goods to Babylon on their ships. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> grew rich from her prosperity (REB)

> became wealthy by trading with her, and she was so wealthy!

> her wealth made owners of all the ships on the sea richWestern Bukidnon Manobo Back Translation on TW.

**wealth:** The Greek word here refers to things that are expensive or costly. Babylon spent a lot of money on expensive goods. Other ways to translate this word are:

> lavish living (NJB)

> costly/extravagant goods

#### 18:19d

**For in a single hour she has been destroyed.”**

* For in one hour she has been destroyed!”
* He/They has completely ruined her in a single hour!”

**For:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *For* is often translated as “because.” This conjunction introduces the reason for the saying of “woe” in 18:19c. In some languages it is necessary or more natural not to translate the conjunction. Do this if the context implies in your language that 18:19d is the reason for the saying of woe in 18:19c.

**in a single hour she has been destroyed:** This is a passive clause, similar to 18:17a. The difference here is that the word *she* replaces “such great wealth.” Some languages must use an active or intransitive clause. For example:

> In one hour they have destroyed her

> in one hour she has lost everything! (GNT)

> in a short time all of the things in it have perished

**in a single hour:** This phrase implies suddenly or in a short time. Translate this phrase as you did in 18:10\.

### Section 18:1–24: Announcements/Messages about Babylon

In this section, three heavenly beings each announce something about Babylon. The first announcement is that the city is destroyed. Her riches and prosperity have been taken away.

The second announcement is that God’s people should leave Babylon before God destroys her. It also describes how kings and others mourn over the destroyed city.

The third announcement is that Babylon will never be built again.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> An angel announced that Babylon was destroyed, and some groups are sad

> Announcements about the destruction of Babylon

> Various people talk about Babylon

#### 18:20a–b

There are three ways to interpret who spoke this verse:

1. The voice from heaven (18:4–19\) continued speaking. The voice stopped telling what the ship captains and the others said in 18:19\. For example:

    > 19…in one hour she has been laid waste!’ 20 Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you saints and apostles and prophets, because God has pronounced judgment for you against her.” (NASB) *(NASB, GW, NJB)*

2. John spoke. The ship captains and the others stopped speaking in 18:19\. For example:

    > 19…And in one hour she has lost everything!”

    > 20 Be glad, heaven, because of her destruction! Be glad, God’s people and the apostles and prophets! For God has condemned her for what she did to you! (GNT) *(GNT, NLT, NET, REB)*

3. The ship captains and the others (18:17b) continued speaking. For example:

    > 19…In one hour she has been laid waste.

    > 20 Rejoice over her, O heaven, saints and apostles and prophets, for God has given judgment for you against her!” (RSV) *(BSB, RSV, NIV, NABRE, CEV, NCV, ESV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).Beale (page 915\), Smalley (page 460\), and Kistemaker (page 500\) support interpretation (1\). Lenski (page 528\) says it is not John. Osbourne (page 634\) indicates with punctuation in his translation that it is not the seafarers. For example, in 12:12 a voice from heaven commanded heaven to rejoice. Interpretation (3\) is unlikely because it would indicate that the ship captains and the others would weep and mourn the destruction of Babylon and then praise God. Interpretation (2\) is unlikely because it is unlikely that John would command heaven to rejoice.

The voice from heaven spoken all of 18:4–20 but John has not referred to it since 18:4\. It has also quoted what others have said.

In some languages it is not clear who is speaking here. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain who is speaking in your translation. For example:

    > The voice from heaven continued and said, “Rejoice…

    > The voice from heaven concluded, “Rejoice…

* Explain who is speaking in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > The voice from heaven continued speaking here.

#### 18:20a

**Rejoice over her, O heaven, O saints and apostles and prophets,**

* ¶ O heaven, believers, apostles, and prophets, rejoice regarding what happened to her,
* ¶ The voice from heaven continued and said, “Everyone in heaven, God’s people, apostles, and his spokespeople! Rejoice that she has been destroyed/ruined!

**Rejoice over her, O heaven, O saints and apostles and prophets:** There is a textual issue in 18:20a: (1\) Many early Greek manuscripts have the text the saints and the apostles (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some later Greek manuscripts have the text the holy apostles (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. The Greek clause is literally “Rejoice over her, heaven and saints and apostles and prophets!” The phrase telling who is being addressed (*heaven…saints and apostles and prophets*) occurs after what is said to them. In some languages it is more natural to say who are being spoken to first. For example:

> O heaven, saints, apostles, and prophets, rejoice over her!

**Rejoice over her:** This clause indicates that heaven and the others are to rejoice regarding what happened to Babylon. God has judged her and punished her, which was the right thing to do. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> Rejoice over her fate (NLT)

> Rejoice about how God has judged her

**O heaven:** This phrase refers to all those in heaven. In some languages it is not natural to speak directly to a place. If that is true in your language, you may need to refer to the people there. For example:

> All those in heaven

> Everyone in heaven

**saints:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *saints* means “holy ones.” It refers to all believers. For example:

> God’s people (GNT)

See how you translated this word in 5:8 or 17:6\.

**apostles and prophets:** These *apostles and prophets* are saints/believers who have the gift of apostleship or prophecy.

**apostles:** In general, the Greek word that the BSB translates as *apostles* refers to those sent with a message. They are representatives or messengers of a higher authority. Here it refers to those sent to other cities with the gospel of Jesus (as were Barnabas and Saul in Acts 13:1–3\).

Some ways to translate this word are:

* Translate the meaning. For example:

    > representatives

    > special messengers

    > sent\-people *If this word is too general, you may need to add the words “of Jesus Christ” to show from whom they got their authority. An example is:*

    > representatives of Jesus Christ

* Use the major language word or phrase.

See how you translated this word in 2:2\.

**prophets:** A *prophet* is a person to whom God gives a message. The message (often called a “prophecy”) may include a vision, as in Ezekiel 1 and Daniel 8\. A message, called a prophecy, may reveal something about past events, current events, or future events. The prophet speaks God’s message to the people or writes it down for their use. See how you translated this word in 2:20 or 16:6\.

#### 18:20b

**because God has pronounced for you His judgment against her.**

* because God has judged her because of what she did to you.”
* For God has judged her worthy of death just as she judged you in the same way.”

**because:** This conjunction introduces the reason that heaven and God’s people should be glad. For example:

> for (RSV)

But in some languages it is necessary or more natural not to translate the conjunction. Do this if the context implies in your language that 18:20b is the reason that heaven and God’s people should be glad.

**God has pronounced for you His judgment against her:** This clause indicates that God had judged and punished Babylon for persecuting the people of God. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> God has condemned her for what she did to you! (GNT)

> God has punished her because of what she did to you (NCV)

**pronounced…judgment:** The words *pronounced…judgment* indicates that God looked at the facts and then decided that Babylon was guilty of wrongdoing.

### Section 18:1–24: Announcements/Messages about Babylon

In this section, three heavenly beings each announce something about Babylon. The first announcement is that the city is destroyed. Her riches and prosperity have been taken away.

The second announcement is that God’s people should leave Babylon before God destroys her. It also describes how kings and others mourn over the destroyed city.

The third announcement is that Babylon will never be built again.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> An angel announced that Babylon was destroyed, and some groups are sad

> Announcements about the destruction of Babylon

> Various people talk about Babylon

#### 18:21a

**Then a mighty angel picked up a stone the size of a great millstone**

* ¶ Then a powerful angel picked up a boulder/rock the size of a big millstone
* ¶ Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder as heavy as a large millstone.

#### 18:21b

**and cast it into the sea, saying:**

* and threw it into the sea/ocean and said,
* He threw it into the sea/ocean and said,

#### 18:21a–b

**mighty:** This word refers not only to physical strength but probably also to great authority and influence.

**a stone the size of a great millstone:** A *stone* is a rock. A *millstone* is a very large, circle\-shaped stone used to grind grain into flour. A *great millstone* likely weighed hundreds of kilograms (double that for the number of pounds). An example of a *great millstone* of that time is:

In some languages people are not familiar with using millstones for grinding grain. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain what a millstone is in your translation. For example:

    > a large stone, like one used for grinding grain (NCV)

    > one of a set of a very large circular stones used for grinding much grain at once

* Use a general word for a stone of this size. For example:

    > a huge stone (CEV)

    > a heavy boulder *You may then want to explain the Greek phrase in a footnote. An example footnote is:*

    > Literally: “a stone the size of a large millstone.” A large millstone likely weighs over 50 kilograms. It is circular with a hole in the middle. It is used to grind grain into flour.

#### 18:21c–24b

The angel first spoke about the city of Babylon using grammar equivalent to using the pronoun “she” (18:21c–d). He then spoke directly to Babylon using the pronoun “you” (18:22a–23d).

In some languages it is more natural to refer to someone or something with the same pronoun. If that is true in your language, consider which pronoun would be most natural in these verses.

#### 18:21c

**“With such violence the great city of Babylon will be cast down,**

* “With that same kind of violence, Babylon the great city will be destroyed,
* “The beast/monster will demolish the great city of Babylon just as violently as that boulder was thrown down.

**With such violence the great city of Babylon will be cast down:** The phrase *With such violence* is emphasized because it is first in the clause. If possible, emphasize this phrase.

**With such violence:** This phrase refers to how powerfully the angel threw the stone into the sea. For example:

> This is how the great city Babylon will be violently thrown down (GNT)

**the great city of Babylon will be cast down:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active or intransitive clause. The beast (and the ten kings) (17:16\) will destroy the city. For example:

> the beast will cast down the great city of Babylon

> the great city Babylon will meet its ruin/end

> the great city Babylon will become a ruin

If you translate following the last two examples, your translation should imply that someone destroyed the city.

**cast down:** Here the phrase *cast down* refers figuratively to the beast destroying the city. It is used here to be compared to how the angel threw the stone.

In some languages the phrase *cast down* cannot be used that way. If that is true in your language, you may want to translate the figurative meaning. For example:

> destroyed

#### 18:21d

**never to be seen again.**

* and it will never be found/seen again.
* So it will be gone forever.

**never to be seen again:** The boulder disappeared forever under the surface of the sea. So also Babylon will never exist again. For example:

> and will never be seen again (GNT)

**to be seen:** This clause is passive. Some ways to translate it are:

* Use a passive clause. For example:

    > to be found (NIV)

* Use an active clause. For example:

    > for anyone to find/see

* Use an intransitive clause. For example:

    > Babylon will disappear

### Section 18:1–24: Announcements/Messages about Babylon

In this section, three heavenly beings each announce something about Babylon. The first announcement is that the city is destroyed. Her riches and prosperity have been taken away.

The second announcement is that God’s people should leave Babylon before God destroys her. It also describes how kings and others mourn over the destroyed city.

The third announcement is that Babylon will never be built again.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> An angel announced that Babylon was destroyed, and some groups are sad

> Announcements about the destruction of Babylon

> Various people talk about Babylon

#### 18:22a–b

**And the sound of harpists and musicians, of flute players and trumpeters, will never ring out in you again:** This clause indicates that no one will ever make music in Babylon after this time. This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> No one will ever hear the music of harpists and musicians, flute players, and trumpeters in you again.

> Harpists and musicians, flute players and trumpeters will never make music in you again.

#### 18:22a

**And the sound of harpists and musicians, of flute players and trumpeters,**

* The music of people playing harps or singing, playing flutes and trumpets
* No one will ever hear harpists, singers, flutists, and trumpeters playing

**the sound of harpists and musicians, of flute players and trumpeters:** This phrase refers to four different kinds of musicians. The Greek word that the BSB translates as *musicians* usually refers generally to people who know how to play any musical instrument. Here it may mean “singer.” For example:

> The music of harps and of human voices, of players of the flute and the trumpet (GNT)

**harpists:** The word *harpists* refers to people who know how to play harps. A harp is a stringed instrument. For example:

> people playing harps (NCV)

See how you translated this word in 14:2\.

**musicians:** This Greek word refers generally to those who make music, either by singing or with instruments. This word occurs in a list of people playing particular instruments, so it seems more likely that it refers to singers. For example:

> singers (NLT)

> minstrels (RSV)

(Here the word “minstrel” refers to someone who sings and possibly plays an instrument at the same time.)

**flute players:** A *flute* is a tube with holes that the *players* cover to make music when they blow air over the sharp edge at the end.

A *flute* may also be a series of pipes of different lengths that make different notes.

**trumpeters:** The word “trumpet” refers to a musical instrument that was often used to alert people to danger. It was also used to announce important messages. At that time trumpets were made from metal or from animal horns. A *trumpeter* blows into a trumpet in such a way as to make the trumpet sound.

The particular kind of trumpet is not important here. In some languages people use trumpets made of animal horn, shell, bamboo, or other material. If that is true in your language, you may want to use the word for that kind of trumpet here.

Some languages do not have a word for *trumpeters*. If that is true in your language, you can:

* Use a word for a person who uses a loud instrument, preferably one that someone blows into.
* Use a method of announcing in your area.
* Use the major language word for *trumpeters*.

See how you translated the word “trumpet” in 1:10 or 8:2\.

#### 18:22b

**will never ring out in you again.**

* will not be heard in you(sing) any more.
* in that city again.

**will never ring out in you again:** The pronoun *you* refers to the city of Babylon. In some languages it is more natural to refer to the city indirectly. For example:

> will never be heard in your/her city again

> will never be heard in that city again

Also see note at 18:21c–24b.

**will never ring out:** In Greek, this clause is passive. See note at 18:22a–b.

#### 18:22c

**Nor will any craftsmen of any trade be found in you again,**

* A craftsman of any trade/craft will not be seen/found in you(sing) any more.
* Craftsmen/Artisans will never work in that city again.

**Nor will any craftsmen of any trade be found in you again:** This clause indicates that there will be no workmen in the city of Babylon after this time. People will no longer be making things in the city. This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> no one will ever see/find a craftsman of any trade in you again

> There will be no more skilled craftsmen at work there.

**craftsmen of any trade:** This phrase refers to people who have the ability to make things such as houses, furniture, baskets, or tools. For example:

> craftsmen of every skill (NJB)

Some languages do not have a general word for *craftsmen*. If that is true in your language, you may want to begin with a list of kinds of workers and end with “others.” For example:

> housebuilders, basketmakers, or other workers like that

#### 18:22d

**nor the sound of a millstone be heard in you again.**

* The sound of a scraping millstone will not be heard in you any more.
* No one will ever hear people grinding food for a meal in that city again.

**nor the sound of a millstone be heard in you again:** This clause indicates that no one will be grinding grain in the city of Babylon after this time. It is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> no one will ever hear the sound of a millstone grinding grain in you again

**sound of a millstone:** This phrase refers to the sound of scraping one flat stone against another with wheat between the stones. This action grinds the wheat into flour. Women did this every day. They used the flour to make bread for their families.

In some languages people are not familiar with using stones for grinding grain. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the work that is done with the *millstone*. For example:

    > the sound of grinding grain (CEV)

* Use a general word for preparing food. For example:

    > sound of preparing food *You may then want to include a footnote to explain the Greek words. For example:*

    > Literally: “the sound of a millstone.” A millstone is used to grind grain into flour for bread. At that time, every day people would grind grain.

#### 18:23a

**The light of a lamp will never shine in you again,**

* The light of a lamp will not shine in you any more.
* Not a single light from a lamp will ever shine in that city again.

**The light of a lamp will never shine in you again:** This clause indicates in several more ways that no one will live in Babylon after this time. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> Never again will the light of a lamp be seen in you (GNT)

> No one will ever live in you, so no lamp will ever shine in you again

**lamp:** A *lamp* in Jesus’ time was a small clay bowl in which people burned oil. The bowl was shaped to hold a wick on one side. See how you translated this word in 1:12\.

#### 18:23b

**and the voices of a bride and bridegroom will never call out in you again.**

* The voice of bridegroom and bride will not be heard in you any more.
* No one will ever hear people getting married in that city again.

**and the voices of a bride and bridegroom will never call out in you again:** This indicates that people will not get married in Babylon after this time. This is because no one will live there. In Greek, this clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause, as the BSB models.

**bride:** The word refers to the woman about to marry.

**bridegroom:** The word refers to the man about to marry.

#### 18:23c

**For your merchants were the great ones of the earth,**

* You were destroyed because your merchants were the world’s most influential people,
* That city is now desolate because its sellers became the magnates/tycoons of the world

**For:** This conjunction introduces the reason why God will destroy the city identified as Babylon. Some English versions allow the context to imply its meaning and so do not translate this conjunction.

**your merchants were the great ones of the earth:** The city’s merchants were the world’s great men in the sense that they were very rich and powerful. The people of the city bought many expensive things. Therefore, the merchants became rich from all that selling. This wealth made them very powerful. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> Its merchants were the important people of the world (GW)

> Your businessmen were the most powerful in the whole world

**merchants:** This word refers to those who buy, sell, and trade as a job. See how you translated this word in 18:3 or 18:15\.

**the great ones of the earth:** The merchants were *great* because they had a lot of wealth and influence over others. They were greater than all others. For example:

> the greatest in the world (NLT)

#### 18:23d

**because all the nations were deceived by your sorcery.”**

* and all the nations were led astray by your sorcery,
* and because that city deceived all of the nations with her clever lies which worked like sorcery.

**because:** This Greek conjunction indicates that 18:23d is the second reason why the city was destroyed. It remained empty and ruined, as described in 18:21c–23a. For example:

> and (RSV)

**all the nations were deceived by your sorcery:** The phrase *were deceived by your sorcery* is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> By your sorcery you deceived all the nations

**sorcery:** The Greek word refers figuratively to how this city cleverly deceived the nations. Then they were eager to follow her. For example:

> you deceived the nations with your sorceries (NLT)

See how you translated this word in 9:21\.

### Section 18:1–24: Announcements/Messages about Babylon

In this section, three heavenly beings each announce something about Babylon. The first announcement is that the city is destroyed. Her riches and prosperity have been taken away.

The second announcement is that God’s people should leave Babylon before God destroys her. It also describes how kings and others mourn over the destroyed city.

The third announcement is that Babylon will never be built again.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> An angel announced that Babylon was destroyed, and some groups are sad

> Announcements about the destruction of Babylon

> Various people talk about Babylon

#### 18:24a–b

**And:** This Greek conjunction probably indicates that 18:24a–b continues telling more reasons why Babylon was destroyed. For example:

> For (JPB)

**there was found in her the blood of prophets and saints, and of all who had been slain on the earth:** There are two ways to interpret who spoke these words:

1. The angel who began speaking in 18:21 continues speaking here. The ending quote mark occurs at the end of 18:24\. *(RSV, NIV, NJB, NASB, NABRE, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NCV, ESV)*
2. The angel stopped speaking at 18:23 and John wrote his own thoughts here. The ending quote mark occurs at the end of 18:23\. *(BSB, GNT, REB)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).Aune (page 965\) supports interpretation (1\). And Beale (page 923\) says, “The second *hoti* of v 23 does double duty and thus also introduces v 24\.”

#### 18:24a

**And there was found in her the blood of prophets and saints,**

* and in her the blood of prophets and of saints was found,
* God has found her responsible for the blood/death of prophets, other of God’s people,
* She was guilty for the deaths of prophets and other saints,

**there was found in her the blood:** In the Greek, the phrase *in her* is emphasized by being first in the clause. If possible, emphasize this phrase.

In some English versions, the verb phrase *there was found* occurs before the subject (*blood*). This is an English poetic style that also emphasizes the verb phrase. In the Greek, the verb is not emphasized. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> The blood of prophets, God’s people, and everyone who had been murdered on earth was found in it (GW)

> In your streets flowed the blood… (NLT)

This clause indicates that the city was responsible for killing prophets, saints, and all others who were killed. For example:

> You are guilty of the death… (NCV)

This clause is passive. Some ways to translate it are:

* Use a passive clause. For example:

    > In her was seen the blood

* Use an active clause. For example:

    > God has found her responsible for the blood…

* Use a verb that implies that God considered her to be responsible. For example:

    > She is guilty/responsible for the blood…

    > She is guilty of killing…

**in her:** The Greek uses the pronoun *her* to refer to Babylon. In 18:23a–d the angel used the second person pronoun “you.” In some languages it is more natural to continue using the second person. For example:

> In you

Or you may have continued to use the pronoun “she” in 18:23a–d, based on how you translated 18:21c–d. If that is true, continue using “she/her” here. Also see note on 18:21c–24b.

**of prophets and saints:** The *prophets* are *saints* who have the gift of prophecy. For example:

> prophets and other saints

**prophets:** A *prophet* is a person to whom God gives a message. The message may include a vision, as in Ezekiel 1 and Daniel 8\. The message, called a prophecy, may reveal something about past events, current events, or future events. The prophet speaks God’s message to the people or writes it down for their use. See how you translated this word in 18:20\.

**saints:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *saints* means “holy ones.” It refers to all believers. See how you translated this word in 18:20\.

#### 18:24b

**and of all who had been slain on the earth.**

* even the blood of all who have been killed on the earth.”
* and indeed responsible for all whom someone killed on the earth.”
* even the deaths of all those people killed on the earth.”

**all who had been slain on the earth:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> all whom others have slain on the earth

## Revelation 19:1 (id: 523258)

### Section 19:1–10: A huge crowd praised God

In this section, a huge crowd praised God because God had punished Babylon. The twenty\-four elders in heaven and the four living creatures around the throne in heaven worshiped God in response.

Then a voice from the throne urged all who follow God to praise him. Another crowd (or possibly the same crowd as in 19:1–3\) praised God for gathering believers to Jesus. This gathering was referred to as a wedding. An angel told John a message for him to write.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> Crowds/Multitudes sang songs of victory and praise

> Various groups sang songs of victory and praise

> Rejoicing in Heaven (ESV)

#### 19:1a

**After this I heard a sound like the roar of a great multitude in heaven,**

* ¶ After those things, I heard what sounded like a huge crowd in heaven,
* ¶ After that, I heard something like the loud noise of a great multitude in heaven.

**After this:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *this* is literally “these (things).” It refers to what John had already seen and heard. This clause introduces a new scene in heaven. For example:

> After those things

> After that

**I heard a sound like the roar of a great multitude:** This clause probably indicates that John only heard the shouting. He did not see who made this sound. So he described what he thought it sounded like. For example:

> I heard what seemed to be the great sound of a huge crowd (NJB)

**the roar of a great multitude:** The Greek is literally “a great voice/sound of a large crowd.” The crowd said the words of 19:1b–2d together.

**great multitude:** John did not say whether this *great multitude* consisted of angels, people, or both.Some scholars say it refers to angels and some say it refers to believers. The crowd said about believers, “He has avenged the blood of His servants” (19:2d), and “His bride has made herself ready” (19:7d). It seems more natural for angels to say this than believers. But the crowd in 19:6–8 could be different from the crowd in 19:1–2\. So the crowd in 19:1–2 could be believers. The text is not clear if they are different or not. Your translation should allow this phrase to refer to either people or angels, or both.

**heaven:** Here the word *heaven* refers to the place where God lives.

#### 19:1b

**shouting: “Hallelujah!**

* saying, “Alleluia!
* They were shouting, “Praise(plur) God!
* The multitude was yelling, “Let us all praise God!

**shouting:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *shouting* is literally “saying.” The BSB uses the word *shouting* because John indicated it was loud (19:1a). Use the verb that is natural in your language to describe people talking loudly.

**Hallelujah:** This Hebrew word means “praise Yah(weh).” Yahweh is God’s name based on Exodus 3:14\. The word occurs often in Psalms 113–118\. For example, see Psalm 113:1, where the BSB translates it as “Praise the Lord.” Other ways to translate this word are:

* Spell the Hebrew word as people in your language would say it. People in your area may already use this word. For example:

    > Alleluia (NJB) *You may then want to explain the meaning of the word in a footnote. An example footnote is:*

    > This Hebrew word means “praise Yah(weh).” Yahweh is God’s name based on Exodus 3:14\.

    > This Hebrew word means “praise God.”

* Translate only the meaning of this word. For example:

    > Praise God! (GNT)

    > Let us praise God!

#### 19:1c

**Salvation and glory and power belong to our God!**

* Our(incl) God has brought us salvation! Glory and power are his!
* Our God is the one who saves his people! He is glorious/majestic! He is powerful!

**Salvation and glory and power belong to our God:** There is a textual issue in 19:1c: (1\) Early Greek manuscripts have the text power (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) A few later Greek manuscripts have the text honor and power (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. The Greek phrase is literally “Salvation and glory and power of our God.” It acknowledges God’s *Salvation and glory and power*. God has saved his people, and he has glory and power. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> Our(incl) God has brought us salvation! Our God has glory and power!

> Let us acknowledge our God who is glorious, who is powerful, and who saved his people

**Salvation:** This word refers to rescuing someone from hell, death, harm, or danger. Here God has rescued his people from Babylon. The word *Salvation* is a noun that refers to an event. In some languages it is more natural to use a verb here. For example:

> saving/freeing by God of his people

> for God to save mankind/us(incl)

> saving from death

See how you translated this word in 7:10 or 12:10\.

**glory:** This word refers to brightness. It symbolizes greatness, power, splendor, and majesty. Other ways to translate this word are:

> splendor

> radiance

In some languages it is more natural to translate this noun as an adjective. For example:

> Our(incl) God is glorious!

See how you translated this word in 4:9\.

**power:** This word refers to the ability to cause things to happen. It does not refer only to physical strength. In some languages it will be more natural to translate this word as an adjective. For example:

> Our(incl) God is powerful!

#### 19:2a

**For His judgments are true and just.**

* For the judgments he makes/gives are true/right and just/fair,
* True, he judges fairly and justly/rightly.

**For:** This conjunction introduces the basis for declaring that salvation, glory, and power belong to God (19:1c).

**His judgments are true and just:** This clause indicates that God always judges fairly. He always judges the wrongdoer to be guilty. Some English versions have the description before what was described. This is an English poetic style. For example:

> true and just are his judgments (NIV)

However, in some languages it is more natural to have the description afterward, as the BSB models. See how you translated this clause in 16:7\.

**judgments:** This word refers to decisions that God makes about whether someone is guilty of sin or not. God judged Babylon as guilty of many sins. In some languages it is necessary or more natural to translate this noun as a verb. For example:

> He judges/decides

**true:** Here the word *true* refers to God’s judgments being accurate. They are not mistaken or wrong.

**just:** Here the word *just* refers to judging rightly. Other ways to translate this word are:

> right

> proper

#### 19:2b

**He has judged the great prostitute**

* and he has judged and punished the well\-known prostitute
* He has also condemned Babylon who was like an infamous/notorious prostitute.

19:2b begins with the Greek conjunction that means “because” or “in that.” It indicates that 19:2b is either a second reason for acknowledging God’s salvation (19:1c), glory, and power, or a basis for saying that God’s judgments are true and just (19:2a). Translate this word so that it allows either of these connections. For example, the NASB says:

> for

In some languages it is necessary or more natural not to translate the conjunction. Do this if the context will imply the correct connection in your language.

**judged:** The Greek word here implies that God has judged the prostitute to be guilty, and he has punished her. For example:

> punished (NLT)

**great:** This word means “important” or “well\-known” here. The word does not refer to a large or fat woman. Other ways to translate this word are:

> notorious (GW)

> famous

> infamous

See how you translated this in 17:1\.

**prostitute:** This word refers to the symbolic woman who is named “Babylon” in 17:5\. A prostitute often entices men to have sexual relations with her. Translate this word as you did in 17:1 or 17:15\.

#### 19:2c

**who corrupted the earth with her immorality.**

* who made the whole earth immoral because of her sexual sins.
* She ruined the morals of all mankind with her seductive sinning against God.

**who corrupted the earth with her immorality:** This clause tells the reader more about the great prostitute. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other great prostitutes and only this one *corrupted the earth with her immorality*. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about the great prostitute. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> She corrupted the earth with her immorality.

**corrupted the earth with her immorality:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *corrupted* refers to ruining someone’s morals or to seducing a virgin. The word *earth* refers to mankind here. The great prostitute, Babylon, encouraged and enticed the people of the world to sin against God. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> made the earth evil with her sexual sin (NCV)

> ruined the morals of people over the whole earth by her adulteries

**immorality:** This word refers to sexual immorality of all kinds. This word probably refers to sinning against God in many ways. In particular, it refers to being unfaithful to him by worshiping idols. See how you translated this word in 17:2\.

#### 19:2d

**He has avenged the blood of His servants that was poured out by her hand.”**

* He has paid Babylon back for spilling the blood of his servants.”
* He has taken revenge upon her because she killed those who served him.”

**avenged:** This word refers to giving the proper penalty for wrongdoing. Here God destroyed Babylon because Babylon had killed his servants. Other ways to translate this word are:

> taken revenge (GW)

> taken vengeance (REB)

> paid…back (NCV)

See how you translated this word in 6:10\.

**the blood of His servants that was poured out by her hand:** This phrase refers to God’s people being killed. For example:

> because she killed his servants (GNT)

**His servants:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *servants* can also be translated as “slaves.” Here the phrase refers to believers serving God. The difference between “slave” and “servant” is not important here. See how you translated the word *servants* in 2:20 or 11:18\.

Then a voice from the throne urged all who follow God to praise him. Another crowd (or possibly the same crowd as in 19:1–3\) praised God for gathering believers to Jesus. This gathering was referred to as a wedding. An angel told John a message for him to write.

**And a second time they called out: “Hallelujah!**

* They spoke a second time, “Alleluia!
* They shouted more, “Praise(plur) God!
* They shouted further, “Let us all praise God!

**a second time they called out:** The Greek clause is literally “they said a second time.” It indicates they spoke more. It does not mean that they repeated exactly what they said earlier.

**called out:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *called out* is literally “said.” Translate this word as you did in 19:1\.

#### 19:3b

**Her smoke rises forever and ever.”**

* Her smoke rises eternally.”
* The smoke from her punishment/destruction rises forever!”

**Her smoke rises:** This phrase refers to evidence of the punishment that was given to Babylon. The beast and the ten kings will burn the city named Babylon (17:16\) but God’s punishment lasts forever. The Greek grammar and the BSB have the focus on the smoke. The focus is not on who burned her here. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> her smoke (NCV)

> the smoke from her punishment

**forever and ever:** The Greek phrase is literally “into the ages of the ages.” The word “age” refers to a very long time. So the phrase “the ages of the ages” refers to eternity. For example:

> for timeless ages (JBP)

**And the twenty\-four elders and the four living creatures fell down**

* ¶ The twenty\-four elders and the four living beings prostrated themselves,
* ¶ The twenty\-four leaders and the four living beings knelt, put their faces to the ground with arms outstretched,

**elders:** Here the word *elders* refers to those who have authority. For example:

> leaders (GW)

These are the same elders as in 4:4\. See how you translated this word there.

**four living creatures:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *living creatures* is literally “living (ones).” The word refers to heavenly beings that John described in 4:7–8\. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> four living beings (NLT)

> four living things/ones

See how you translated this phrase in 4:6 or 14:3\.

**fell down:** Here the phrase *fell down* refers to kneeling and putting the face to the ground with arms outstretched toward someone. This position showed complete humility before that person and honored him. The word *fell* implies a quick and complete action. It does not refer to accidentally falling. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> prostrated themselves

> threw themselves to the ground (NET)

Many languages have a different action that shows humility and honors someone. If that is true in your language, you may want to use that action. See how you translated this phrase in 3:9 or 11:16\.

#### 19:4b

**and worshiped God who sits on the throne,**

* and worshiped/revered God, who was ruling on the throne.
* and worshiped/honored God. He was sitting on his place/seat of ruling, ruling with full authority.

**worshiped:** This word refers to honoring someone or something as sacred/divine. Other ways to translate this word are:

> venerated

> revered

See how you translated this word in 13:4 or 15:4\.

**God who sits on the throne:** This clause tells the reader more about God. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other gods and only this one *sits on the throne*. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about God. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> God sits on the throne.

**throne:** This word refers to the official chair of a king. It is a symbol of his power to rule. Here the word *throne* refers to the place from where God rules. See how you translated this word in 1:4\.

#### 19:4c

**saying: “Amen, Hallelujah!”**

* They were saying, “Amen, alleluia!”
* They said fervently, “Even so! Let us all praise God!”

**saying:** The Greek word that the BSB literally translates as *saying* indicates that what they said was a part of their worship. The people spoke fervently, so some English versions use the word “cried.” That word does not refer to weeping or wailing.

**Amen:** The word *Amen* is a Hebrew word that means “even so” or “it is true.” It is used to agree with what was said. The Greek borrowed the Hebrew word. English borrowed this word as well. See how you translated this word in 1:6 or 7:12\.

#### 19:5a

**Then a voice came from the throne, saying:**

* Then someone spoke from the throne. He said,
* Then I heard someone saying from the place/seat of ruling,

**a voice came from the throne:** John does not say who spoke here, but it does not refer to God (19:5b). Translate this phrase so that it refers to someone other than God. For example:

> speech from the throne

> someone said from the throne on God’s behalf

#### 19:5b

**“Praise our God, all you who serve Him, and those who fear Him, small and great alike!”**

* “All his servants, indeed, all who fear him, both the humble and the important, praise(plur) our(incl) God!”
* “All who serve God, namely those who are in awe of him and revere him, whether you(plur) are of lowly or high status, praise our God!”

**Praise our God, all you who serve Him, and those who fear Him, small and great alike!:** The voice addresses *all you who serve Him, and those who fear Him, small and great alike*. This address comes after the command. In some languages it is more natural to have the address first. For example:

> All you his servants, you who fear him, both small and great, praise our God!

**all you who serve Him, and those who fear Him, small and great alike:** These words refer to believers. The words describe them in three ways:

1. They are his servants.
2. They fear him.
3. Some of them have low status, and some of them have high status.

Translate in a way that all three descriptions apply to believers. Other ways to translate these words are:

> all his servants, all who fear him, from the least to the greatest (NLT)

> all who serve and fear him, no matter who you are (GW)

> all you his servants, indeed all who fear him, both lowly and great

**those who fear Him:** Here the word *fear* means “respect” or “revere.” People who *fear* God think about him in awe. They also realize he is all\-powerful and can do as he chooses, so they respect him. This is not the type of fear that means “afraid” or “frightened.”

In some languages the word *fear* only means “be afraid.” If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Include the implied meaning of “respect” or “revere” in your translation. For example:

    > Fear and respect/revere God

* Translate the meaning of *fear* as “respect” or “revere.” For example:

    > have reverence for (GNT)

    > honor (NCV)

    > respect

**small and great alike:** This phrase refers to believers of low status and believers of high status. It implies people of all classes and position in society. The phrase does not refer to physical size. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> humble and great alike

> both of high and lowly position/place

#### 19:6a–b

**And I heard a sound like the roar of a great multitude, like the rushing of many waters, and like a mighty rumbling of thunder:** John described the sound in three ways. He compared it to *a great multitude*, *the rushing of many waters*, *and like a mighty rumbling of thunder*. He did not say who or what made the sound.

#### 19:6a

**And I heard a sound like the roar of a great multitude,**

* ¶ Then I heard what sounded like the noise of a huge crowd,
* ¶ Then I heard something like the loud noise of a vast number of people.

**And I heard a sound like the roar of a great multitude:** John described the noise he heard as being like a lot of people talking loudly. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> I heard what sounded like a crowd (GNT)

> I heard what sounded like a great many people (NCV)

#### 19:6b

**like the rushing of many waters, and like a mighty rumbling of thunder,**

* like much water rushing over rapids and like loud thunder,
* The noise/sound was like the roar of a waterfall and the roar of thunder.

**the rushing of many waters:** The Greek phrase is literally “the sound of many waters” (as in the RSV). It refers to the sound of a lot of rapidly moving water. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> a roaring waterfall (GNT)

> the roar of mighty ocean waves (NLT)

> the noise of flooding water (NCV)

See how you translated this phrase in 14:2\.

**a mighty rumbling of thunder:** This phrase refers to crashes or rolls of loud thunder. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the loud rumbling of thunder

> the great roar of thunder (NJB)

> the noise of loud thunder (NCV)

#### 19:6c

**crying out: “Hallelujah!**

* shouting, “Alleluia,
* It said, “Let us all praise God!

**crying out:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *crying out* is literally “saying.” The noise was very loud, so the BSB uses the word “shouting.” But the crowd probably spoke in loud voices but did not yell. For example:

> saying (NASB)

#### 19:6d

**For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns.**

* because our(incl) All\-Powerful Lord God rules.
* For our Lord God, the one who has all power, rules over all things.

**For:** This conjunction introduces the reason for praising God (19:6c).

**the Lord our God the Almighty:** There is a textual issue in 19:6d: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the word our (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the word the (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT recommends it. The word *Almighty* is a title. It means, “the one with the power to do anything.” For example:

> the All\-Powerful (NET)

See how you translated this word in 1:8 or 16:14\.

**reigns:** This word refers to ruling as king. God rules over all things. For example:

> is King (GNT)

Then a voice from the throne urged all who follow God to praise him. Another crowd (or possibly the same crowd as in 19:1–3\) praised God for gathering believers to Jesus. This gathering was referred to as a wedding. An angel told John a message for him to write.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> Crowds/Multitudes sang songs of victory and praise

> Various groups sang songs of victory and praise

> Rejoicing in Heaven (ESV)

#### 19:7a–b

**Let us rejoice and be glad and give Him the glory:** The speakers exhorted themselves to *rejoice and be glad and give Him the glory*. Translate this saying as an encouragement or a command to themselves and others. For example:

> Rejoice everyone! Be glad! Give him glory!

> We(incl) should/must rejoice, be glad, and give him glory!

#### 19:7a

**Let us rejoice and be glad**

* Let us(incl) rejoice and indeed exult,
* Let us be very glad/joyful indeed.

**Let us rejoice and be glad:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *be glad* means “rejoice very much.” The use of two verbs of similar meaning emphasizes the meaning of rejoicing. For example:

> Let us rejoice and exult (RSV)

If you have translated Matthew 5:12, see how you translated the phrase *rejoice and be glad* there.

In some languages using two verbs does not emphasize the meaning that they have in common. If that is true in your language, emphasize it in a way that is natural. For example:

> Let us rejoice exceedingly/fully

> Let us rejoice with much joy/rejoicing!

#### 19:7b

**and give Him the glory.**

* and glorify him!
* Let us acknowledge his glory/majesty!

**give Him the glory:** This is a command to agree that God has glory. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> agree that he has glory

> acknowledge his glory

> praise his greatness (GNT)

In some languages it is more natural to use a verb for *glory*. For example:

> glorify him

See how you translated *glory* in 19:1\.

#### 19:7c

**For the marriage of the Lamb has come,**

* For now is the time for the wedding of the Lamb,
* For the wedding of the Lamb is about to begin/occur,

**For:** This conjunction introduces the reason for praising God (19:7a–b).

**the marriage of the Lamb has come:** This clause indicates that it was the time to begin the wedding. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> the time has come for the wedding of the Lamb (GNT)

> the wedding day of the Lamb is here (CEV)

> the Lamb is now about to marry his bride

**the marriage of the Lamb:** The word that the BSB translates as *marriage* is literally “wedding.” This phrase is a metaphor. It refers to believers becoming united with Jesus in the establishment of his final kingdom with them. The phrase does not imply any kind of sexual relationship.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer to Jesus marrying a woman, not a metaphor for believers being with him. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain that this is a figure of speech in your translation. For example:

    > the celebration of the Lamb like a wedding/marriage

    > the celebration,like a wedding/marriage, of the Lamb being united with his people

* Translate the literal meaning and explain its meaning in a footnote. For example:

    > This phrase is a metaphor. It refers to the celebration at the time when Christ will be united to his church.

* Translate the meaning without the metaphor. For example:

    > the celebration of the Lamb being united with his people *You may then want to explain the meaning of the Greek words in a footnote. An example footnote is:*

    > Literally: “the wedding/marriage of the Lamb.” This phrase is a metaphor. It refers to the celebration at the time when Christ will be united to his church.

**the Lamb:** This is a title for Jesus. Jewish people killed a lamb at the Passover as a sacrifice to God. The lamb has symbolic meaning as a special sacrifice and is a symbol for the Christ. See how you translated this title in 5:6 or 17:14\.

In some languages readers would not clearly understand a literal translation as a title for Jesus. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain in a footnote that the word *Lamb* is a title for Jesus as the Christ. For example:

> This word is a symbolic title for Jesus. It indicates that he was like the lambs that the Jewish people sacrifice to God at every Passover Feast. Like those lambs, he died at Passover as a sacrifice to God.

#### 19:7d

**and His bride has made herself ready.**

* and his bride has prepared herself for him.
* and his bride has readied herself.

**His bride has made herself ready:** This clause indicates that the bride had made herself beautiful for the wedding. For example:

> his bride has prepared herself for it (GNT)

**His bride:** The word *bride* is a metaphor for all believers. It continues the metaphor of the wedding/marriage (19:7c). You will probably want to follow the same strategy to translate this word as you did for “wedding” in 19:7c. For example:

* Explain that this is a figure of speech in your translation. For example:

    > all believers in him, like a bride,

    > all his people, like a bride

* Translate the literal meaning and explain its meaning in a footnote. For example:

    > This word is a metaphor. It refers to all believers in Jesus.

* Translate the meaning without the metaphor. For example:

## Revelation 19:8 (id: 523273)

### Section 19:1–10: A huge crowd praised God

In this section, a huge crowd praised God because God had punished Babylon. The twenty\-four elders in heaven and the four living creatures around the throne in heaven worshiped God in response.

Then a voice from the throne urged all who follow God to praise him. Another crowd (or possibly the same crowd as in 19:1–3\) praised God for gathering believers to Jesus. This gathering was referred to as a wedding. An angel told John a message for him to write.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> Crowds/Multitudes sang songs of victory and praise

> Various groups sang songs of victory and praise

> Rejoicing in Heaven (ESV)

#### 19:8a–b

There is an interpretive issue regarding the speaking of 19:8a–b. There are several ways to interpret where the speaking stops:

1. The speaking stops at the end of 19:8a. 19:8b is John’s comment. *(BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NABRE, NLT, GW, NET, REB, NCV, ESV)*
2. The speaking stops at the end of 19:8b. *(NJB, CEV)*
3. The speaking stops at the end of 19:7d. John observed what happened in 19:8a, but 19:8b is his own thought. *(NASB)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).Aune (page 1013\) and Kistemaker (page 513\) support interpretation (1\). Aune (page 1030\) calls 19:8b “an explanatory interpolation.”

#### 19:8a

**She was given clothing of fine linen, bright and pure.”**

* She was permitted to wear beautiful linen clothes, gleaming and clean.”
* God allowed her to wear a dress made of highest quality, shiny, clean flax cloth.”

**She was given clothing of fine linen, bright and pure:** The Greek phrase is literally, “It was given to her that she might wear fine linen bright (and) clean.” There are two ways to interpret what is given to the bride:

1. The bride was given permission to wear fine linen. For example:

    > She is permitted to wear the finest white linen (NLT96\) *(RSV, NJB, NASB, NABRE, NLT96, GW, NET, ESV, KJV)*

2. The bride was given linen to wear. For example:

    > and she has been given fine linen, shining and clean, to wear (REB) *(BSB, NIV, GNT, NLT, CEV, REB, NCV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).Beale (page 938\) and Aune (page 1030\) support interpretation (1\).

However, the context implies that the bride put on the linen clothes. In some languages a literal translation would not imply that. If that is true in your language, you should include the implied information in your translation. For example:

> She is permitted to wear the finest white linen and she put it on

**fine linen:** Here the word *fine* indicates that the *linen* was very good quality. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> High quality linen clothing

> Very good linen clothing

> Expensive linen clothing

See how you translated this phrase in 18:12\.

**linen:** This word refers to expensive cloth made from a plant called flax. The cloth is smooth and strong yet soft.

In some languages people are not familiar with *linen*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain this word in your translation. For example:

    > flax cloth

    > smooth cloth

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. Here are example footnotes:

    > Linen is an expensive cloth made from a plant called flax. The cloth is smooth and strong yet soft.

    > See footnote on linen at 15:6\.

See how you translated this word in 15:6 or 18:12\.

**bright:** This word indicates that the linen was shiny. Other ways to translate this word are:

> shining (GNT)

> dazzling (NJB)

#### 19:8b

**For the fine linen she wears is the righteous acts of the saints.**

* For the beautiful linen cloth represents the upright/just deeds of believers.
* (The flax cloth symbolizes the good deeds that God’s people do.)

**For:** This Greek conjunction indicates that 19:8b explains 19:8a.

**the fine linen she wears is the righteous acts of the saints:** This clause explains the symbolic meaning of “fine linen” in 19:8a. These words are probably John’s, because it is unlikely that the shouting crowd (19:6a–8a) would explain the symbolic meaning of the linen. So some English versions put parentheses around the clause. Other ways to indicate that these are John’s words are:

> —for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints. (RSV)

> …to wear.” For the fine linen represents the good deeds of God’s holy people. (NLT)

> dazzling, pure linen.” This fine linen represents the righteous deeds that God’s holy people do.

> (The interpretation of that white cloth is the righteous deeds of the people who belong to God.)Western Bukidnon Manobo Back Translation.

**is:** This phrase indicates that the linen represents the deeds of the saints. For example:

> signifies (REB)

**righteous acts:** The word *righteous* indicates that the deeds are upright or good in God’s eyes. God wants believers to do these kinds of deeds. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> upright deeds

> the deeds/things of which God approves

**saints:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *saints* means “holy ones.” It refers to all believers. For example:

> God’s people (GNT)

See how you translated this word in 18:20\.

* **Associated Passages:** REV 19:8

## Revelation 19:9 (id: 523275)

### Section 19:1–10: A huge crowd praised God

In this section, a huge crowd praised God because God had punished Babylon. The twenty\-four elders in heaven and the four living creatures around the throne in heaven worshiped God in response.

Then a voice from the throne urged all who follow God to praise him. Another crowd (or possibly the same crowd as in 19:1–3\) praised God for gathering believers to Jesus. This gathering was referred to as a wedding. An angel told John a message for him to write.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> Crowds/Multitudes sang songs of victory and praise

> Various groups sang songs of victory and praise

> Rejoicing in Heaven (ESV)

#### 19:9a

**Then the angel told me to write,**

* ¶ Then he said to me, “Write this:
* ¶ Then the angel told me, “Write the following:

**the angel told me:** The Greek word is literally “he\-said.” Here “he” could refer to:

1. Whoever spoke 19:6–8a. This being (or beings) had such a powerful voice that John described it as sounding like a great multitude (19:6a).
2. Whoever spoke 19:5\.
3. Whoever spoke 19:1–3 or perhaps someone in chapter 18\.
4. The angel referred to in 17:1\.

You should translate so that it allows any of these interpretations. The BSB and other English versions do so by not describing which angel this is.

**to write:** This word is a command to write the words spoken in 19:9b. For example:

> Write this, (NJB)

#### 19:9b

**“Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.”**

* ‘Favored are those who are asked/invited to the wedding feast of the Lamb!’ ”
* ‘Those people whom God has invited to the Lamb’s wedding meal/banquet are in a good place in his eyes.’ ”

**Blessed:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Blessed* describes a person who is in a good situation. In the Bible, the good situation results from God showing favor/kindness to the person. It also indicates that God approves of this kind of person.

This word does not primarily refer to a feeling. However, a person in this good situation will frequently have good feelings such as happiness and joy. Do not use a word that only refers to material prosperity or physical health.

Other ways to translate this word are:

> Favored

> How good it is

> In a good/desirable position in God’s eyes

> Shown kindness by God

See how you translated this word in 1:3 or 16:15\.

**those who are invited:** The clause *who are invited* is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> those whom God has invited

**invited:** This word refers to God asking all believers to come to this celebration.

**marriage supper:** In Jewish custom, a large meal was part of the wedding celebration. Here, the time of day that the meal will be eaten is not implied or important. For example:

> wedding supper (NIV)

> the feast celebrating the marriage

#### 19:9c

**And he said to me, “These are the true words of God.”**

* He also said, “Those words are the true words of God.”
* He continued, “That saying is indeed God’s true words.”

**he said to me:** The Greek clause is literally “he says to me.” The pronoun *he* refers to the same speaker as in 19:9a. Also, this clause indicates that the command to write the exact words (19:9a–b) has ended but the person continued speaking. For example:

> He also told me (GW)

**These are the true words of God:** This clause emphasizes that the words in 19:9b are indeed God’s words and that they are true. For example:

> These things that God has said are true (CEV)

**These:** Here this word refers back to 19:9b. In some languages it is more natural to use “those” when referring back.

* **Associated Passages:** REV 19:9

## Revelation 19:10 (id: 523276)

### Section 19:1–10: A huge crowd praised God

In this section, a huge crowd praised God because God had punished Babylon. The twenty\-four elders in heaven and the four living creatures around the throne in heaven worshiped God in response.

Then a voice from the throne urged all who follow God to praise him. Another crowd (or possibly the same crowd as in 19:1–3\) praised God for gathering believers to Jesus. This gathering was referred to as a wedding. An angel told John a message for him to write.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> Crowds/Multitudes sang songs of victory and praise

> Various groups sang songs of victory and praise

> Rejoicing in Heaven (ESV)

#### 19:10a

**So I fell at his feet to worship him.**

* ¶ At that, I prostrated myself at his feet to worship/revere/honor him.
* ¶ When I heard what he said, I knelt and put my face to the ground with arms outstretched at his feet in order to worship him.

**So I fell at his feet:** Here this clause refers to kneeling and putting the face to the ground with arms outstretched toward someone. This position showed complete humility before that person and honored him. The word *fell* implies a quick and complete action. It does not refer to accidentally falling. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> I prostrated myself before him

> I threw myself down at his feet (NET)

> I bowed down at the angel’s feet (NCV)

> I knelt at the feet of the angel (CEV)

See how you translated the verb at 19:4 (“fell down”).

**worship:** This word refers to honoring someone or something as sacred/divine. Other ways to translate this word are:

> venerate

> revere

See how you translated this word in 13:4 or 19:4\.

#### 19:10b

**But he told me, “Do not do that!**

* But he said to me, “Do not do that!
* But he commanded/told me, “Do not worship me!

**Do not do that:** The Greek clause is literally “See not.” It is a command to John not to do what he was doing. John was not to prostrate himself before the angel. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> Do not do it! (NIV84\)

> Do not worship/honor me

#### 19:10c

**I am a fellow servant with you**

* I am your(sing) fellow slave/servant
* For I serve God just as you do,

19:10c is a reason why John should not worship the angel. In some languages it is more natural to clearly indicate it is the reason. For example:

> For I am…

**I am a fellow servant with you:** This clause indicates that the angel served God just as John served God. They both did the things that God told them to do. For example:

> I am a servant together with you (GNT)

**fellow servant:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *servant* can also mean “slave.” It indicates that the angel did what God told him to do. The difference between “slave” and “servant” is not important here.

Some languages do not have a single word for “slave.” If that is true in your language, you may want to refer generally to those who serve God. Or if the word “slave” is not appropriate for believers in your language, you may want to refer generally to those who serve God. For example:

> one who serves God as you do

See how you translated the word *servant* in 10:7 or 15:3\.

#### 19:10d–f

**the testimony of Jesus…the testimony of Jesus:** This phrase occurs in both 19:10d and 19:10f. It probably has the same meaning in both places. There are two ways to interpret this phrase:

1. It indicates that believers give their testimony about Jesus. For example:

    > bear their witness to Jesus. …those who bear witness to Jesus (REB) *(NLT, NABRE, CEV, NET, REB, NCV)*

2. It indicates that Jesus gave the testimony. For example:

    > the truth that Jesus revealed (GNT) *(GNT)*

Many English versions translate the Greek grammar literally as *of*, as the BSB does. It is not possible to tell which interpretation they follow. You may also translate this phrase in a similar way. But some languages must choose either interpretation (1\) or interpretation (2\). If that is true in your language, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).Beale (page 946\) supports interpretation (1\). Aune (page 1014\) probably supports interpretation (1\): “the testimony concerning Jesus.”

#### 19:10d

**and your brothers who rely on the testimony of Jesus.**

* and the fellow slave/servant of your brothers who have the testimony/message of Jesus.
* and as other believers do, who are faithful to the witness of Jesus.

**your brothers:** Here the word *brothers* refers to other believers. It refers to both men and women. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> your brothers and sisters (NLT)

> your siblings in believing/faith

> your fellow believers

**who rely on the testimony of Jesus:** This clause tells the reader more about the believers (“your brothers”). In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that only some believers *rely on the testimony of Jesus*. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about all believers. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> They rely on the testimony of Jesus.

**rely on:** Here, the phrase *rely on* indicates that the believers continue to believe that their testimony about Jesus is true. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> are faithful to

> have

**testimony:** The word *testimony* means “the words spoken about what one saw or knows.” The word *testimony* is often used when the person speaking is expected to be truthful and accurate. Other ways to translate this word are:

> witness (NJB)

> message (NCV)

See how you translated this word in 12:17 or 17:6 (where the BSB translates it as “witnesses”).

#### 19:10e

**Worship God!**

* Worship/Revere/Honor(sing) only God.

**Worship God:** This command indicates that John should worship only God. He should never worship an angel or anyone else. It was not a command to begin worshiping God at that moment. For example:

> Worship only God. (NLT)

#### 19:10f

**For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.”**

* For the testimony/message of Jesus is the essence/purpose of prophecy.”
* For true prophecy involves the witness of Jesus.”

**For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy:** There are two ways to interpret who spoke:

1. The angel spoke this clause. *(BSB, NIV, NRSV, NASB, NABRE, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, REB, NCV, KJV)*
2. John wrote his own thought here. *(RSV, GNT, NJB, ESV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).Aune (page 1014\), Osbourne (page 671\), and Caird (page 233\) include 19:10f in the angel’s speech in their translations.

**For:** This conjunction introduces an explanation about “the testimony of Jesus” (19:10d).

**the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy:** The word “spirit” probably means “essence” or “main principle” here. For example:

> the testimony of Jesus is the essence of prophecy

> the testimony of Jesus is the main principle of prophecy

This clause is generally understood in several ways that are close in meaning:

1. The purpose of prophecy is to testify about Jesus.
2. Anyone telling others about Jesus is, in effect, prophesying to them.
3. Words of true prophecy agree with what Jesus said and did.

Translate the phrase *the testimony of Jesus* in a way that is similar in meaning to your translation of that phrase in 19:10d.

**prophecy:** The word *prophecy* refers to a message that God gives to someone. The message may include a vision, as in Ezekiel 1 and Daniel 8\. A *prophecy* may reveal something about past events, current events, or future events. The prophet speaks the *prophecy* to the people or writes it down for their use.

Some languages do not have a word for *prophecy*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > direct message from God

    > God’s new message

    > a message that God has revealed

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. Example footnotes are:

    > The word “prophecy” refers to a message that God gives to someone. The message may be words or visions. A “prophecy” may speak about something that happened in the past, something currently happening, or something that will happen in the future.

    > See the footnote on “prophecy” at 1:3\.

See how you translated this word in 1:3\.

## Revelation 19:11 (id: 523278)

### Section 19:11–21: The rider on a white horse conquered his enemies

In this section, John saw a rider on a white horse. An army followed him. An angel called to the birds to gather. The beast gathered his army, but they lost the battle. Someone captured the beast and the false prophet and threw them into the lake of fire. Birds ate the bodies of the defeated soldiers.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> Jesus fought against the beast and false prophet

> The one riding a white horse won the battle

#### 19:11a

**Then I saw heaven standing open,**

* ¶ Then I saw heaven open,
* ¶ Then I saw an opening into heaven,

**heaven standing open:** This clause indicates that John could see into heaven, God’s dwelling place. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> heaven opened (RSV)

> heaven open (NJB)

**standing open:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *standing open* is literally “having been opened.” When John looked, the opening into heaven was already there.

#### 19:11b

**and there before me was a white horse.**

* and look/hey, I saw a white horse.
* and suddenly a white horse appeared before me!

**and there before me was:** The Greek words are literally “and look.” The word “look” emphasizes or calls attention to the words that follow. It also probably indicates surprise or suddenness. The word “look” is not a command to look at the horse. Other ways to translate these words are:

> indeed/hey,

> and look,

> and behold,

> suddenly/unexpectedly I saw

See how you translated this phrase in 14:1 or 14:14\.

**horse:** A *horse* is a large, four\-legged animal that weighs 500 kilograms (1100 pounds) or more. They are about 1\.5 meters (5 feet) high at their back. People ride horses.

In some languages people are not familiar with horses. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the word in your translation. For example:

    > riding animals called horses

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > A horse is a large animal that a person can ride. Some soldiers rode horses to help them fight war.

See how you translated this word in 6:2 or 18:13\.

#### 19:11c

**And its rider is called Faithful and True.**

* Its rider’s names are “Faithful” and “True.”
* The man riding on it was named Trustworthy/Dependable and True.

**And its rider is called Faithful and True:** This clause tells the reader more about the white horse. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that John was thinking of other white horses and only this one had a *rider…called Faithful and True*. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about the white horse. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> The rider of the horse is called Faithful and True.

**is called Faithful and True:** The words *Faithful* and *True* describe the rider. The verb *called* indicates that the words *Faithful* and *True* are used as names. For example:

> is named Faithful and True (GW)

**Faithful:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Faithful* refers to someone who is worthy of trust. People can depend on that person. Here the word indicates that the rider was completely reliable, dependable, and truthful in all that he says. Other ways to translate this word are:

> Dependable

> Trustworthy (NJB)

See how you translated this word in 1:5\.

**True:** Here the word *True* indicates that the rider never tells lies. He is never deceitful.

#### 19:11d

**With righteousness He judges and wages war.**

* In right/just ways he judges and fights wars.
* He judges and battles righteously.

**With righteousness He judges and wages war:** The phrase *With righteousness* is emphasized in the Greek and the BSB. If possible, emphasize this phrase in your translation.

**With righteousness:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *righteousness* is often translated as “righteousness” (as in the RSV). Here it indicates that the rider judges and makes war with righteous goals and means. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> justly

> in uprightness (NJB)

This phrase applies to both “judges” and “makes war.”

**judges:** The word *judges* indicates that the rider decides whether or not a person or nation is guilty of wrongdoing.

**wages war:** This phrase refers to fighting in organized groups. Often one nation *wages war* against another nation. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> fights a war

> battles

* **Associated Passages:** REV 19:11

#### 19:12a

**He has eyes like blazing fire,**

* His eyes were like flames of fire, (NLT)
* His eyes are bright like flames of fire,

**He has eyes like blazing fire:** The Greek clause is literally “His eyes like a flame of fire.” Other ways to translate this clause are:

> His eyes were like flames of fire (NLT)

> His has eyes like bright flames of fire

This phrase should be translated similarly to the phrase “His eyes were like a blazing fire” in 1:14b.

#### 19:12b

**and many royal crowns on His head.**

* and on his head he wore many crowns.
* and he has many headdresses on his head, indicating he is king.

**and many royal crowns on His head:** The phrase *on His head* is emphasized in the Greek. If possible, emphasize the phrase *on His head* in a natural way in your language. For example:

> and on his head are many crowns (NIV)

**royal crowns:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *royal crowns* refers to a decorated metal circle or covering for the head. Kings wear *royal crowns* on their heads. The *royal crowns* here are a symbol of the authority to rule people.

In some languages people are not familiar with *royal crowns*. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain it in your translation. For example:

> headpieces/hats of rulers

> headdresses of authority

See how you translated this word in 4:4 or 13:1\.

#### 19:12c

**He has a name written on Him that only He Himself knows.**

* A name was written on him that is known only by him.
* He wrote on himself a name that only he knows.
* He is the only one/person who knows the name that was on him.

**a name written on Him:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active or intransitive clause. Probably God or the rider wrote the name. For example:

> a name that God wrote on him

> a name that the rider wrote on himself

> a name on him

If you translate according to the last example, your translation should imply that the name was written.

**He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood,**

* He wears clothes that have been dipped in blood,
* He wears a blood\-soaked robe/garment.

**He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *robe* refers generally to any kind of clothing. For example:

> He wears clothes dipped in blood (GW)

**a robe dipped in blood:** This clause indicates that the *robe* had been immersed in *blood*. It was still blood\-red in color.

This clause is passive. Some ways to translate it are:

* Use a passive clause. For example:

    > his cloak was soaked in blood (NJB)

* Use an active clause. For example:

    > a robe that he had dipped in blood

* Translate it without saying who dipped it. For example:

    > a blood\-soaked robe/garment

    > a robe that was completely red with blood

#### 19:13b

**and His name is The Word of God.**

* and his name is: The Word of God.
* God has named him “God’s Message.”

**His name is The Word of God:** This clause implies that the rider is Jesus. John called him the Word (of God) in John 1:1\.

This name is different from the name in 19:12\. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that this name is the same as the name in 19:12\. If that is true in your language, indicate here that this name is a different one. For example:

> another name of his is the Word of God

> God has named him “the Word of God”

> Also 13ahe is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, 13band his name is the Word of God.

**The Word of God:** This title indicates that the rider is God’s message to the world. Another way to translate this phrase is:

> God’s Message

**The armies of heaven,**

* Heaven’s armies
* The armies of heaven

**armies:** This word refers to large groups of soldiers.

These verses do not say whether the soldiers are angels (as in Matthew 26:53\) or believers (as in Revelation 17:14\). If possible, do not say in your translation whether the soldiers are angels or believers.

Some language must say who is in the army. If possible, refer to soldiers without naming them as people or angels. If you must name people or angels, you should refer to believers (as in Revelation 17:14\). You may then want to explain the word in a footnote. An example footnote is:

> The Greek words do not say here whether these armies are armies of angels or armies of believers. But 17:14 refers to an army of believers. The plural word “armies” may imply both kinds of armies.

#### 19:14b

**dressed in fine linen, white and pure,**

* wearing clothing made of beautiful linen cloth, white and clean,
* wore clothes of clean, white, high quality flax cloth.

**dressed in fine linen:** Here the word *fine* indicates that the *linen* was very good quality. The word *linen* refers to expensive cloth made from a plant called flax. See how you translated this phrase in 18:12 or 19:8\.

#### 19:14c

**follow Him on white horses.**

**And from His mouth proceeds a sharp sword**

* Out of his mouth came a sharp war machete
* A long, sharp fighting knife extended/protruded from his mouth.

**And from His mouth proceeds a sharp sword:** Here the word *proceeds* indicates that the handle of the sword was in his mouth. The blade of the sword extended forward from his mouth. The word *proceeds* here does not indicate any motion of the sword. For example:

> From his mouth extends a sharp sword (NET)

See how you translated a similar clause in 1:16 (“out of his mouth came a sharp…sword”).

**And from His mouth:** This phrase is emphasized in the Greek and the BSB. If possible, emphasize this phrase in a natural way in your language.

**sword:** A *sword* is a hand\-held weapon that cuts or stabs. The swords of that time were 60–120 centimeters (2–4 feet) long and made of metal. See how you translated this word in 1:16 or 13:14\.

#### 19:15b

**with which to strike down the nations,**

* which he will use to defeat the nations.
* He will defeat the nations of the earth with it.

**with which to strike down the nations:** This clause tells the reader more about the sword. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other swords coming from the rider’s mouth and he will only use this one *to strike down the nations*. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about the sword. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> He will strike down the nations with it.

**to strike down the nations:** This phrase indicates the role or purpose of the sword. Using this sword, the rider would win the war against his enemies. For example:

> he will defeat the nations (GNT)

**the nations:** Here, the word *nations* refers figuratively to the enemies of God. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer to a different group. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

> the peoples of the earth

> God’s enemies in/from every nation

#### 19:15c

**and He will rule them with an iron scepter.**

* “He will rule them forcefully/harshly with an iron staff/stick.”
* “He will lead/govern them to their destruction with a club made of iron.”

**and He will rule them with an iron scepter:** This saying is from Psalm 2:9\. Translate these words as you did in 12:5\. It has the same meaning. If you are unclear as to the meaning, see the notes at 2:27\. But here the word *He* refers to the rider on the white horse (19:11–15b).

#### 19:15d

**He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty.**

* He crushes under foot the grapes in the winepress of God All\-Powerful’s great anger.
* He tramples the grapes in the place/hole for making/collecting grape juice. This is the place/hole that contains the vast anger of God, the One who has all power.

**He treads:** This word refers to stepping hard on something. Here it refers to the action of stepping repeatedly on grapes in order to squeeze the juice out of them. Other ways to translate this word are:

> crush (NCV)

> stomps (NET)

> trample (GNT)

See how you translated this Greek word in 14:20 (“trodden”).

**the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God:** In the Old Testament the *winepress* represents the time when God judges evildoers. Grapes are crushed in a winepress. Likewise, God will punish evildoers. The phrase *the fury of* indicates that *the wrath of God* is very great. Another way to translate this phrase is:

> winepress that contains God’s very great wrath

See how you translated a similar phrase in 14:19 (“winepress of God’s wrath”).

**the winepress:** At that time, a *winepress* was a hole dug in soft stone. Grapes were put in it to be squeezed for their juice. The *winepress* had an outlet where people collected the grape juice. The juice was made into wine.

In some languages people are not familiar with winepresses. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Describe the *winepress*. For example:

    > place to make grape juice for wine

    > place to crush grapes in order to get the juice

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > At that time, a winepress was a hole dug into soft stone. People crushed grapes in it and collected the juice.

    > See the footnote on the winepress at 14:19\.

See how you translated this word in 14:19\.

**the fury of the wrath:** There is a textual issue in 19:15c: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the word of (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) A few later Greek manuscripts have the word and (KJV, NABRE). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. The Greek word that the BSB translates as *fury* refers to great emotion. The whole phrase refers to the great anger that God has toward his enemies. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the fierce wrath (NLT)

> the terrible anger (NCV)

See how you translated a similar phrase in 16:19 (“the fury of his wrath”).

**the Almighty:** This word is a title which means, “the one with the power to do anything.” For example:

> the All\-Powerful (NET)

See how you translated this word in 1:8 or 16:7\.

### Section 19:11–21: The rider on a white horse conquered his enemies

In this section, John saw a rider on a white horse. An army followed him. An angel called to the birds to gather. The beast gathered his army, but they lost the battle. Someone captured the beast and the false prophet and threw them into the lake of fire. Birds ate the bodies of the defeated soldiers.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

#### 19:16a

**And He has a name written on His robe and on His thigh:**

* On his robe and on his thigh this name is written on him,
* On his robe and on his thigh God had written this name,
* He had this name on his robe and on his thigh:

**And He has a name written on His robe and on His thigh:** The phrase on His robe and on His thigh is emphasized in the Greek. If possible, emphasize this phrase in a way that is natural in your language. For example:

> On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written: (NIV)

**He has a name written:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> he has a name that God wrote on him

> he has a name that he himself wrote on him

> he has a name on him

If you translate according to the last example, your translation should imply that the name was written.

**robe:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *robe* refers generally to any kind of clothing. For example:

> clothes (GW)

#### 19:16b

**KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.**

* King/Leader over all Kings/Leaders and Lord over all Lords.
* The One who rules all rulers and the One with authority over all others who have authority.

**KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS:** These two phrases say almost the same thing. Repeating a similar meaning emphasizes their shared meaning.

In some languages repeating a similar meaning has a different use. If that is true in your language, emphasize the meaning in a natural way. For example:

> he is the greatest King, indeed the greatest Lord

> he is indeed the mightiest King and Lord, ruler over all!

> King/Ruler and Lord over each and every king and leader

**KING OF KINGS:** A king has authority over everyone in his kingdom. The phrase *KING OF KINGS* indicates that the rider has authority over all kings (and everyone else). See how you translated this phrase in 17:14\.

**LORD OF LORDS:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *LORD* means “the one in authority over (others)” or “owner.” The phrase *LORD OF LORDS* indicates that the rider has authority over all lords (and everyone else). See how you translated this phrase in 17:14\.

#### 19:17a

**Then I saw an angel standing in the sun,**

* ¶ Then I saw an angel standing in/on the sun.
* ¶ Then I saw an angel standing with the sun behind him.

**standing in the sun:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *in* can also mean “on.” For example:

> standing on the sun (GNT)

But many English versions and scholars indicate that it means “in” here. In this sense it probably means “in front of” rather than “inside of” here. For example:

> in the brightness of the sunYakan Back Translation on TW.

> in the middle of the sunWestern Bukidnon Manobo Back Translation on TW.

#### 19:17b

**and he cried out in a loud voice to all the birds flying overhead,**

* He shouted/exclaimed in a loud voice to all the birds flying in the sky,
* He called loudly to all the birds that were flying,

**he cried out:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *cried out* refers to speaking loudly so that the person can be heard well. The word does not refer to weeping or wailing. For example:

> shouted (CEV)

See how you translated this word in 6:10 (“cried out”) or 18:18 (“cry out”).

**all the birds flying overhead:** This phrase refers to all birds that can fly. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> all the birds flying in the sky (NCV)

> all the birds flying in midair (NIV)

> all birds that fly

#### 19:17c

**“Come, gather together for the great supper of God,**

* “Come and gather together for God’s great feast/meal,

**the great supper of God:** God will kill many enemies in the coming war. The birds will eat the flesh off the dead bodies (19:21\). So this event is called here *the great supper of God*. God provided this meal for the birds For example:

> God’s great feast (GNT)

### Section 19:11–21: The rider on a white horse conquered his enemies

In this section, John saw a rider on a white horse. An army followed him. An angel called to the birds to gather. The beast gathered his army, but they lost the battle. Someone captured the beast and the false prophet and threw them into the lake of fire. Birds ate the bodies of the defeated soldiers.

#### 19:20a

**But the beast was captured along with the false prophet,**

* But the beast was captured, and also the false prophet,
* But the rider on the horse captured the monster and the lying spokesman.

**the beast was captured:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. Jesus, the rider on the horse, captured the beast. For example:

> But the rider on the horse captured the beast

**along with the false prophet:** These words indicate that *the false prophet* was also captured. In some languages it is more natural to repeat the verb here. For example:

> and with him the false prophet was also captured

If you changed the passive clause to an active clause for “the beast was captured,” you should do the same here. For example:

> and with him, the rider on the horse also captured the false prophet

**false prophet:** A true *prophet* is a person who speaks the message that God gives to him. But a *false prophet* is one who speaks a message that does not come from God. This phrase refers to the second beast, the one who came out of the earth. Other ways to translate this are:

> deceitful/lying prophet

> he who says he is a prophet but teaches lies

> spokesman for Satan

> false prophecy say\-er

See how you translated this phrase in 16:13\.

#### 19:20b

**who on its behalf had performed signs**

* who had done miracles in submission to the beast.
* The lying spokesman had worked wonders for the benefit of the monster.

**who on its behalf had performed signs:** This clause tells the reader more about the false prophet. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that John was thinking of many false prophets and only this one *performed signs*. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about the false prophet. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> He had performed miraculous signs on the beast’s behalf.

**on its behalf:** There are two ways to interpret the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *on its behalf*:

1. It means in submission to him or for his benefit. The authority of the false prophet came from the first beast. He worked for the beast. For example:

    > on the beast’s behalf (NJB) *(BSB, NIV, NJB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NCV)*

2. It means in his presence. The false prophet ruled while standing in front of the first beast. For example:

    > before him (KJV) *(RSV, GNT, NASB, NABRE, REB, ESV, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because the false prophet probably will do miracles in many places. He probably will not do miracles only in front of the first beast.Aune (page 1065\) has in his translation: “on his authority.” Osbourne (page 671\) also supports interpretation (1\). See footnote on this phrase at 13:12a.

See how you translated this phrase in 13:12, where the BSB includes it in the phrase “of the first beast.”

**its:** Here this word refers to the beast (19:20a).

**had performed:** Here this word means “did.” For example:

> worked (NJB)

**signs:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *signs* refers to an unusual event that people regard as having some special meaning. The false prophet did amazing and unusual deeds that convinced people to follow the beast. Other ways to translate the Greek word are:

> miracles (NJB)

> mysterious sights

> portents

> wonders

See how you translated this phrase in 13:13 or 16:14\.

#### 19:20c

**deceiving**

* With those miracles he had deceived
* By doing those wonders he had deceived

**deceiving:** This word refers to purposely misleading someone. For example:

> deluded (NIV)

#### 19:20d

**those who had the mark of the beast and worshiped its image.**

* those who had the mark of the beast and worshiped/revered his image/statue.
* the people who had allowed someone to put the sign/symbol of the monster on them. They also worshiped his image.

**those who had the mark of the beast and worshiped its image:** The people spoken of here had both taken the mark and worshiped the image of the beast. These words refers to only one group.

**mark:** This word refers to any kind of sign or symbol that is easily seen. These verses do not say how the mark was placed on the hand or forehead. See how you translated *mark* in 13:16 or 16:2\.

**worshiped:** This word refers to honoring someone or something as sacred/divine. Other ways to translate this word are:

> venerated

> revered

See how you translated this word in 13:4 or 19:10\.

**image:** This word refers to a statue. See how you translated *image* in 13:14 or 16:2\.

#### 19:20e

**Both the beast and the false prophet were thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur.**

* Those two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burned with sulfur.
* The rider on the horse took the monster and the false prophet and threw them alive into the flaming lake where sulfur burned.

**Both the beast and the false prophet were thrown alive:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. Probably the rider, or someone he commanded, threw the beast and false prophet into the fiery lake. For example:

> The rider on the horse threw the two of them alive

**Both the beast and the false prophet:** This phrase refers to the beast and the false prophet here.

**alive:** This word indicates that the beast and the false prophet were still *alive* when the rider or someone he commanded threw those two into the fiery lake.

**the fiery lake of burning sulfur:** The Greek words are literally “the lake of fire, the one burning with sulfur.” This lake had burning sulfur in it instead of water. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the lake of fire that burns with sulfur (NRSV)

> the lake of fire with its sulphurous flames (REB)

**sulfur:** The word *sulfur* refers to a yellow powder or rock\-like substance that burns with a very intense heat. In some languages people are not familiar with *sulfur*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain what *sulfur* is in your translation. For example:

    > yellow rock called sulfur

* Use the major language word. If it is not well known in your language, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Sulfur is a yellow powder or rock\-like substance that burns with a very intense heat. *But if you included a footnote about sulfur at 14:10, you may not want to repeat it here.*

**And the rest were killed with the sword that proceeded from the mouth of the One seated on the horse.**

* The rest of them were killed with the war machete that extended from the mouth of the rider on the horse,
* Then the rider on the horse killed the rest of those who opposed God with the fighting knife that extended/protruded from his mouth.

**And the rest were killed with the sword that proceeded from the mouth of the One seated on the horse:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> The rider on the horse killed the rest of them with the sword that came out of his mouth

**And the rest:** This phrase refers to all who gathered to make war against the rider and his army, except the beast and the false prophet (19:18a–d).

**the sword that proceeded from the mouth:** This is the same symbolic picture as in 19:15a (“And from His mouth proceeds a sharp sword”). The change from the present tense verb “proceeds” to the past tense verb *proceeded* does not change the meaning. Both phrases refer generally to the sword coming out of the mouth. See how you translated that phrase in 19:15\.

#### 19:21b

**And all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.**

* and all the birds glutted themselves with their flesh. (NJB)
* Then all those birds ate the dead bodies until they were completely full.

**gorged:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *gorged* refers to eating large quantities of food. The birds had plenty to eat and probably more than enough. For example:

> ate all they could (GNT)

#### 20:1a

**Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven**

* ¶ Then I saw an angel descending from heaven
* ¶ Then I saw an angel come down from heaven.

**heaven:** Here this word refers to the place where God lives.

#### 20:1b

**with the key to the Abyss, holding in his hand a great chain.**

* with the key to the bottomless pit and a big/strong chain in his hand.
* He had/held the key to the very/immeasurably deep hole that is the home of demons and the dead and carried a huge chain in his hand.

**with the key to the Abyss, holding in his hand a great chain:** The Greek words are literally “having the key to the Abyss and a great chain in his hand.” It indicates that the angel held both a key and a chain *in his hand*. For example:

> He had the key to the bottomless pit and a large chain in his hand (NCV)

> holding in his hand the key of the abyss and a heavy chain (GNT)

**the Abyss:** The word *Abyss* refers to a very deep pit or chasm. It indicates that the pit or chasm was too deep to measure. Here it probably refers to something underground rather than a chasm. See how you translated this word in 9:1 or 17:8\.

**a great chain:** A *chain* is made from circles of metal linked together. It is flexible like rope but much stronger. Here the chain is used to restrain Satan.

In some languages people are not familiar with chains. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a word in your language for something used to tie people so they cannot escape. For example:

    > rope *You may then want to explain the literal word in a footnote. An example footnote is:*

    > Literally: “chain.” A chain is made by linking circles of metal together. Here the chain is used like rope to tie/restrain Satan so that he cannot escape.

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > A chain is made by linking circles/ovals of metal together. Here the chain is used like rope to tie/restrain Satan so that he cannot escape.

**great:** This word indicates that the chain was thick and strong.

#### 20:2b

**who is the devil and Satan,**

* the Devil/Slanderer, also known as Satan,
* that is, that one named the Demon Chief and/or Satan.

#### 20:2a–b

**seized:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *seized* means “arrested,” “took hold of,” or “captured.” For example:

> grabbed (NCV)

> overpowered (GW)

**the dragon, that ancient serpent who is the devil and Satan:** These phrases describe the same being in four different ways. Translate these phrases so that they describe the same being. For example:

> Satan, also named the dragon, the ancient serpent, or the devil

> He chained the dragon…. It is that old snake, who is also known as the devil and Satan. (CEV)

**dragon:** This word refers to a mythical creature something like a huge lizard. This creature was often thought of as breathing fire and having wings. They are usually considered to be much larger than people. Dragons were usually considered to be fierce and dangerous. See how you translated this word in 12:3 or 16:13, or see the notes and illustration at 12:3\.

**ancient serpent:** The word *ancient* indicates that the serpent lived long ago. He has continued to live from then to today. Now he has lived a very long time. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> serpent of that time long ago

> serpent of ancient times

See how you translated this phrase in 12:9\.

**serpent:** This is another way to say “snake” in English.

**who is the devil and Satan:** This clause tells the reader more about the phrase “that ancient serpent.” In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other ancient serpents and only this one *is the devil and Satan*. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about that ancient serpent. For example:

> namely, the devil, or Satan

**devil:** The Greek word here means “slanderer.” A slanderer is someone who says false things about someone to try to ruin that person’s reputation, name, or status. This word is used like a title for the leader of evil spirits, Satan. Make it clear that this word is used like a title:

> Devil (GNT)

Some ways to translate *devil* are:

* Use a local name or idiom that refers to the chief of all demons. For example:

    > Barking One

* Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > leader of the evil spirits

    > spirit enemy of God

* Translate its meaning. For example:

    > Slanderer

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with the meaning of this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > The word “devil” in Greek means “slanderer.”

See how you translated this word in 2:10 or 12:9\.

**Satan:** The word *Satan* is the Hebrew name of the leader of all the evil spirits. The Hebrew word means “enemy” or “opponent.” It is used as a proper name in the New Testament. This name in Greek is spelled *Satanas*. So you should also spell the name in your language like the Greek or the major language version. See how you translated this word in 2:9 or 12:9\.

#### 20:2c

**and bound him for a thousand years.**

* and tied him to stay there for a thousand years.
* The angel tied him with the chain so that he would remain a prisoner for 1,000 years.

**bound him for a thousand years:** This phrase indicates that Satan would remain tied with the chain for a thousand years. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> bound him as a prisoner for a thousand years

> The angel chained up the serpent for 1,000 years. (GW)

**bound:** This word refers to tying/restraining Satan with the chain to prevent escape. For example:

> tied him up (NCV)

**for a thousand years:** The thousand years begin at this time. Immediately after tying Satan, the angel threw him into the Abyss (20:3a). Your translation should indicate that the thousand years begin at this time.

**a thousand:** The Greek phrase uses the number word as the BSB does. There are several ways to translate this meaning:

* Use number words. For example:

    > one thousand

* Use numerals. For example:

    > 1,000

* Use number words or phrase for “thousand” from the major language. For example:

    > one tausen

## Revelation 20:3 (id: 523304)

### Section 20:1–6: Christ reigned for a thousand years

In this section, John saw an angel take Satan and put him into the Abyss. The angel then locked the opening to it. Satan had to stay in the Abyss for one thousand years. He was not allowed to deceive the nations during that time.

Then John saw that Christ ruled during those one thousand years. He gathered believers whom the beast had beheaded and caused them to live again. He had them rule with him.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The Thousand Year Reign (NET)

> Christ ruled for 1,000 years

#### 20:3a

**And he threw him into the Abyss, shut it, and sealed it over him,**

* He threw Satan/him into the bottomless pit, locked its door, and put a seal on it,
* The angel threw him into the deep pit, shut the door to the pit, and locked it. He put on it a wax stamp indicating that no one was to open it.

**shut it:** The Greek word here can mean both “shut” and “lock.” The angel had the key to the Abyss. A key implies that there was a door with a lock. The angel both shut the door and locked it with the key.

In some languages it is more natural to mention the door in your translation. For example:

> shut the door

“Lock the door” implies first shutting the door. In some languages, a literal translation would not imply shutting the door. If that is true in your language, you may want to include the implied meaning. For example:

> shut and locked the door

**sealed:** This word refers to putting something on the door to indicate the door is not to be opened. Only the person with the proper authority should open it.

In some languages people are not familiar with this process of sealing doors. If that is true in your language, you may want to use a word or phrase that indicates that kind of deed. For example:

> affixed with an official stamp/seal

> There was a mark stuck to it so that it might not be opened except by the right person

> someone put a mark/seal on the door and doorjamb to show that it should be opened only by those with the authority to do so

See how you translated this word in 5:1\.

**it:** This pronoun refers to the Abyss. In some languages it is more natural to explain the pronoun *it* as referring to the door of the Abyss. For example:

> its door

#### 20:3b

**so that he could not deceive the nations**

* so that he would not be able to deceive the nations anymore
* This would prevent Satan from deceiving the nations

**so that he could not deceive the nations:** Here, the word *so* introduces the purpose for seizing Satan, binding him, throwing him into the Abyss, locking the door, and sealing it. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> so that he could not deceive the nations (NET)

> The angel did this so he could not trick the people of the earth (NCV)

**the nations:** Here the word *nations* refers to the various countries and people groups living on the earth.

#### 20:3c

**until the thousand years were complete.**

* until after those thousand years finished.
* during the 1,000 years.

**until the thousand years were complete:** This phrase indicates that after one thousand years God would no longer bind/restrain Satan. Then Satan would again deceive the nations. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> until the one thousand years were finished (NET)

> until the 1,000 years were over (GW)

**thousand:** Some languages do not have words for large numbers. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

##### **General Comment on 20:3b–c**

* Use numerals. For example:

    > 1,000 (GW)

* Use the major language word.

In some languages it is necessary or more natural to talk about events in the order they happen. If that is true in your language, consider how to translate the information in 20:3b–c. For example:

> 3bto keep him from deceiving the nations anymore 3cduring the thousand years

> 3cso that a thousand years would go by 3bbefore the dragon could fool the nations again (CEV)

#### 20:3d

**After that, he must be released for a brief period of time.**

* After that time, it is necessary that he be freed for a short time.
* After the thousand years, God will require/cause the angel to release him for a short time.

**After that:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *that* is literally “these (things).” It refers to what John had seen in 20:1–3c. For example:

> After those things happened

**he must be released:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> someone must release him

**he must be:** The Greek words are literally “it is necessary for him to be.” God’s plan includes allowing Satan to be free after the thousand years are over. Another way to translate this phrase is:

> he will certainly be

**for a brief period of time:** This phrase refers to the time during which the events of 20:7–10 take place.

### Section 20:1–6: Christ reigned for a thousand years

In this section, John saw an angel take Satan and put him into the Abyss. The angel then locked the opening to it. Satan had to stay in the Abyss for one thousand years. He was not allowed to deceive the nations during that time.

Then John saw that Christ ruled during those one thousand years. He gathered believers whom the beast had beheaded and caused them to live again. He had them rule with him.

#### 20:4a

**Then I saw the thrones, and those seated on them had been given authority to judge.**

* ¶ Then I saw thrones, and those sitting on them were given authority/right to judge.
* ¶ Then I saw places/seats of ruling. God gave to the ones sitting there the power to judge.

**Then I saw the thrones, and those seated on them had been given authority to judge:** These verses do not say whether these judges were angels, people, or other beings. Your translation should allow any kind of being to be the judges. For example:

> And I saw thrones, with appointed judges seated upon them (JBP)

> Then I saw thrones, and those who sat on them were given the power to judge (GNT)

> Next I saw thrones. The ones sitting on them were given authority to judge.

**the thrones:** The word *thrones* refers to the official chairs where kings or people with great authority sit. A throne represents that authority. See how you translated this word in 19:4\. But here, your translation should refer to the chairs of the judges, not the chairs of kings or other leaders.

**those seated on them had been given authority to judge:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> to whom God had given authority to judge

> whom God appointed/chosen as judges

**authority:** Here the word *authority* refers to having the right and power to control or rule over someone or something.

**judge:** The word *judge* indicates that those on the thrones will decide whether people are guilty of wrongdoing.

#### 20:4b

**And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded**

* I saw the spirits of those who had been killed by their heads being cut off
* I also saw the souls of those whom enemies/others had beheaded

**the souls:** The word *soul* refers to the essential part of a person, the part that does not die when his body dies. Use the usual word for this part of a person.

**those who had been beheaded:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. The beast or one of his followers had beheaded the believers. For example:

> those whose heads the beast had cut off

> those whom others/enemies beheaded

**beheaded:** There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as *beheaded*:

1. It refers to cutting off the head of someone. For example, the GW says:

    > heads had been cut off *(BSB, RSV, NIV, NJB, NASB, KJV, ESV, NABRE, NLT, CEV, NET, REB)*

2. It refers to any kind of killing someone. For example, the NCV says:

    > killed *(GNT, NCV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because the lexicons support it and not interpretation (2\).Aune, Swete, and Kistemaker also support interpretation (1\). Some scholars support interpretation (2\), usually saying that Christians were killed in other ways than beheading. But the Greek lexicons make no mention of the Greek word being used in that way.

#### 20:4c

**for their testimony of Jesus and for the word of God,**

* because they had testified about Jesus and because of God’s message.
* because they had told others about Jesus and they were faithful to God’s word.

**their testimony of Jesus:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *their testimony of Jesus* is literally “the testimony of Jesus.” There are two ways to interpret this phrase:

1. It indicates that people gave a testimony about Jesus. For example:

    > they had told about Jesus (CEV) *(BSB, NIV, NABRE, CEV, NLT, GW, NET, REB, RSV, NASB, NJB)*

2. It indicates that Jesus gave a testimony. For example:

    > they had proclaimed the truth that Jesus revealed (GNT) *(GNT, NCV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).Aune (page 1071\) has in his translation: “their witness to Jesus.” Osbourne (page 698\) has: “their witness about Jesus.”

**for the word of God:** Here the phrase *the word of God* refers to what God said. It is the message from God to people. The believers believed this *word of God*. They probably also told it to others.

In some languages it is necessary to explain what was done with *the word of God*. For example:

> because they believed God’s message

> because they followed God’s word

See how you translated this phrase in 6:9\.

#### 20:4d

**and those who had not worshiped the beast or its image,**

* They had not worshiped/revered the beast or its image/statue
* They had not worshiped/honored the first monster or the statue of/representing him.

**and those who had not worshiped the beast or its image:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *and those who* is literally “and who.” There are two ways to interpret the Greek phrase:

1. It continues talking about those who had been beheaded. For example:

    > and who had not worshiped the beast or its image (RSV) *(RSV, NIV, GNT, NABRE, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, REB, NCV, KJV)*

2. It introduces a new group of people. For example:

    > and those who refused to worship the beast or his statue (NJB) *(BSB, NJB, NASB, ESV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).Aune (page 1088\) says, “It is more natural to construe the text as referring to a single group.” Mounce (on TW, 20:4\) says, “Those who find two groups…have difficulty explaining the fact that in 13:15 John wrote that the first beast was enabled to ‘cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed.’”

**worshiped:** This word refers to honoring someone or something as sacred/divine. Other ways to translate this word are:

> venerated

> revered

See how you translated this word in 13:4 or 19:20\.

**its image:** This word refers to a statue. See how you translated this word in 13:14 or 19:20\.

#### 20:4e

**and had not received its mark on their foreheads or hands.**

* and did not have his mark/sign/symbol on their foreheads or their hands.
* They did not allow anyone to put the mark on their foreheads or on their hands.

**and had not received its mark on their foreheads or hands:** This is the second deed that these believers did not do. In some languages it is more natural to introduce this clause with the word “or.” For example:

> or received its mark on forehead or hand (REB)

**mark:** This word refers to any kind of sign or symbol that is easily seen. These verses do not say how the mark was placed on the hand or forehead. See how you translated *mark* in 13:16 or 19:20\.

#### 20:4f

**And they came to life**

* They returned to life
* God caused them to live again.

**And they came to life:** It is implied that God caused them to live again. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly imply that they returned to life by their own power. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Translate the literal meaning and explain in a footnote that God caused them to live again. An example footnote is:

    > God caused them to live again.

* Explain in your translation that God caused them to live again. For example:

    > God caused them to return to life

#### 20:4g

**and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.**

* and ruled with Christ for one thousand years.
* They ruled as kings/leaders with Christ for a thousand years.

**reigned:** This word refers to ruling over people as their leader. For example:

> ruled as kings (GNT)

**Christ:** The word *Christ* is a title for Jesus. It means “the anointed one.” See how you translated this word in 1:1 or 12:10\.

> Christ ruled for 1,000 years

#### 20:5a

**The rest of the dead did not come back to life until the thousand years were complete.**

* (After the thousand years passed/ended, all the other people who had died returned to life.)
* (God caused all the other dead people to live again only after the thousand years finished.)

**The rest of the dead:** There is a textual issue in 20:5a: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the word The (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some later Greek manuscripts have the phrase But the (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. This phrase refers to dead people who did not come to life in 20:4f.

#### 20:5b

**This is the first resurrection.**

* That is the first group to return to life.
* That is the first time God causes many people to live again.

**This is the first resurrection:** This clause refers back to the resurrection in 20:4f. In some languages it is more natural to use the word “that” when referring back to that event. For example:

> That is the first resurrection

**the first resurrection:** The word *resurrection* refers to when God causes people to come back to life. This will be the first time that a group of people will be resurrected.Jesus caused a few people to live again, and God caused Jesus to live again. But this is the first time God will cause a large group of believers to live again (20:4f–g). It is an event. In some languages it is necessary or more natural to translate this word using a verb. For example:

> the first time that God resurrects people

> the first time when God causes people to live again

> when God first raises a group of people from death

##### **General Comment on 20:5a–b**

The phrase “the first resurrection” (20:5b) refers to those believers of 20:4b–f. But 20:5a tells about what happens one thousand years later (20:12\). You should indicate that 20:5a is extra information about what happens to the other people. Some English versions do this by using parentheses. You may want to:

* Put 20:5a after 20:5b. For example:

    > 5bThis is the first resurrection. 5aThe rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.

* Put 20:5a after all the information about the believers whom God resurrected at this time (20:5b–6d). For example:

    > 5–6This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy are those who have part in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years.

    > The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.

* Use parentheses on 20:5a as the NIV and GNT do.
* Move 20:5a and use parentheses. For example:

    > This is the first resurrection. (The rest of the dead did not come back to life until the thousand years had ended.) (NLT)

#### 20:6a

**Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection!**

* Favored and holy are those who are included in the first resurrection.
* About those whom God causes to live again the first time he does that, they are holy and in a good place in his eyes.

**Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection!:** The BSB and some English versions have the description of the people before mentioning the people. This is an English poetic style. In some languages it is more natural to have the description second. For example:

> Those who have part in the first resurrection are blessed and holy

**Blessed:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Blessed* describes a person who is a good situation. In the Bible, the good situation results from God showing favor/kindness to the person.

This word does not primarily refer to a feeling. However, a person in this good situation will frequently have good feelings like happiness and joy. Do not use a word that only refers to material prosperity or physical health.

Other ways to translate this word are:

> Favored

> How good it is

> In a good/desirable position in God’s eyes

> Shown kindness by God

See how you translated this word in 1:3 or 19:9\.

**holy:** Here the word *holy* refers to being set apart for special service to God. It probably also implies being without sin. Other ways to translate this word are:

> devoted to God

> set apart

> pure/blameless/sinless

See how you translated this word in 14:10\.

**who share in the first resurrection:** This clause refers to people who come back to life during the first resurrection. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> who share in the first resurrection (NLT)

> who are included in this first raising of the dead (GNT)

#### 20:6b

**The second death has no power over them,**

* The second death has no authority over them,
* They will not die a second time.

**second death:** The first death is when a person’s body dies on earth. He is then separated from the things of the earth. The phrase *second death* refers to being thrown into the lake of fire (20:14–15\). In some languages it is necessary to translate *death* as a verb. For example:

> event of dying a second time

**second:** The word *second* refers to the next item after the first one. If counted, this item would be counted as number two. See how you translated this word in 4:7 or 8:8\.

**has no power over them:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *power* can also mean “authority.” The second death will not affect believers. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> cannot touch such men (JBP)

> will not affect them

> They will not be included in the second death

#### 20:6c

**but they will be priests of God and of Christ,**

* and/but they will be like priests of God and of Christ
* Instead they will constantly serve God and Jesus Christ.

#### 20:6d

**and will reign with Him for a thousand years.**

* and will rule with him/Christ for one thousand years.
* They will rule as kings/leaders with him/Christ for a thousand years.

#### 20:6c–d

**but:** This conjunction introduces a contrast to the second death having no power over these believers. Some languages will not indicate contrast here. For example:

> and

In some languages it is more natural to allow the context to indicate the connection and not translate the conjunction. For example:

> They will be priests…. (CEV)

**priests:** A Jewish priest was a religious leader who:

1. offered sacrifices to God for the people,
2. led the people in worship,
3. taught the people about God.

Here the word *priests* refers figuratively to people who serve God as a way of life. They worship God and help others to worship him also.

In some languages the usual word or phrase for *priests* cannot be used figuratively in that way. If that is true in your language, you should translate the meaning in a non\-figurative way. For example:

> those who always serve God

> people doing God’s will/desire as a way of life

> people whose job is to worship God

See how you translated this word in 1:6 and 5:10\.

* Satan will be allowed to leave the jail that he was in
* the angel will release Satan from the prison where he was bound.

#### 20:7a–b

**Satan will be released:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. Probably the angel who bound Satan now released him. For example:

> the angel will release Satan

**his prison:** Satan was locked in the Abyss (20:1–3\), so John refers to it as *his prison*. The word *prison* refers to a place in which people are locked inside so they cannot leave or escape. Another way to translate this phrase is:

> the jail he was in

**and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth—**

* and go to the four corners of the earth deceiving the nations,
* He/Satan will leave there and go to the north, the east, the south, and the west. He will deceive the nations in all those places.

**the four corners of the earth:** This idiom refers to four places that are as far away from each other as possible. Here the idiom implies the whole world. Satan will deceive all nations.

Some languages do not have an idiom that refers to four places which together mean the whole world. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Refer to the north, south, east, and west. For example:

    > in the north, the east, the south, and the west of the earth

* Translate the meaning without the idiom. For example:

    > all places on the earth, both near and far

Also see how you translated this phrase in 7:1\. But note that the meaning is a little different here. Here it refers to anywhere on earth, but in 7:1 it refers to four places that are very far away from each other.

#### 20:8b

**Gog and Magog—to assemble them for battle.**

* symbolized as Gog and Magog, and bringing them together for battle/war.
* The nations are symbolically called Gog and Magog. He will gather them into a huge army,

**Gog and Magog:** The Greek grammar indicates that the phrase *Gog and Magog* explains “the nations in the four corners of the earth.” The names appear in Ezekiel 38–39 as the names of nations who will gather to fight against Israel. So John probably uses the names here to refer to enemies of God from all nations.

In some languages a literal translation would not clearly have this meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning of the names in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > These names appear in Ezekiel 38–39\. John used them here to refer to enemies of God from all nations.

* Indicate in your translation that they are symbolic names. For example:

    > the evil/hostile nations symbolically named Gog and Magog

**assemble them for battle:** In some languages there is a special word for assembling troops to prepare for war. For example:

> mobilise them for war (NJB)

> muster them for war (REB)

#### 20:8c

**Their number is like the sand of the seashore.**

* The people in that army are as many/numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore.
* countless as the sand of the seashore.

**Their number is like the sand of the seashore:** This clause is a metaphor. It indicates that the number of those who gathered for battle was very great. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> as many as the grains of sand on the seashore (GNT)

> They will be as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore (GW)

In some languages a literal translation of this metaphor would not have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the metaphor in your translation. For example:

    > They are so many that counting them would be like trying to count each grain of sand on the seashore

* Translate the literal meaning of the metaphor and explain its meaning in a footnote. For example:

    > This saying exaggerates the count to indicate “very many.”

* Use a common word or phrase in your language that exaggerates the meaning of “very many” or “uncountable.” You may then want to indicate the literal words in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Literally: “their number is like the sand of the sea.”

#### 20:9a

**And they marched across the broad expanse of the earth**

* They traveled over the surface of the earth
* Satan’s army advanced across the broad/wide earth

**And they marched:** The Greek clause is literally “They went up.” The BSB uses the verb *marched* because this is the usual way in English to refer to an army traveling. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> they marched up (RSV)

> Satan’s army marched (NCV)

> they went up (NLT)

**across the broad expanse of the earth:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *earth* can also be translated as “country/region.” There are two ways to interpret it here:

1. It refers to the whole world. For example:

    > all the way across the earth (CEV) *(BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NASB, NABRE, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, ESV, NCV, KJV)*

2. It refers to the country of Israel. For example:

    > They came swarming over the entire country. (NJB) *(NJB, REB)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).Aune (page 1096\) and Beale (page 1026\) support interpretation (1\). Beale says, “Since in Dan. 12:2 LXX “breadth of the earth”…refers to an area throughout the earth…, it is plausible that the same worldwide meaning attaches to the nearly identical phrase in Rev. 20:9\.”

**broad expanse:** This phrase refers to something that is very broad. The vast army approaching God’s people would be very spread out. Other ways to translate this word are:

> breadth (NIV)

> surface

> spread over the earth

#### 20:9b

**and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city.**

* and surrounded the camp of the saints, the beloved city.
* and surrounded the camp of God’s people, which is the city that he loves.

**the camp of the saints and the beloved city:** The Greek words are literally “the camp of the saints and/even the beloved city.” Here, the Greek conjunction meaning “and/even” probably introduces an explanation of the phrase *the camp of the saints*. In other words, *the camp of the saints* is *the beloved city*. For example:

> the camp of the saints, which is the beloved City (NJB)

**camp:** This word refers to a place where a group of people live temporarily, often with some of them prepared, like soldiers, to defend the whole group. Many scholars connect this word to the encampment of the Israelites in the wilderness, as in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.The Greek word can also mean “a military camp” or “an army.” It is not clear how much of the military theme is intended here.

**the saints:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *the saints* is literally “holy ones.” The BSB usually translates the Greek word as “saints.” See how you translated this word (“saints”) in 19:8\.

**the beloved city:** The Greek phrase is literally “the city having been loved.” For example:

> the city he loves (NIV)

These verses do not say who loves this city but they imply that God loves it. In some languages it is necessary or more natural to indicate who loves this city. For example:

> the city that he loves (REB)

> the city God loves (NCV)

Some scholars (Aune, Beckwith, Osbourne) see this phrase referring to the earthly Jerusalem, some (Beale, Charles) to the heavenly Jerusalem, and others (Swete, Kistemaker, Smalley, Johnson, Hughes, Mounce) see it as referring to God’s people as a whole. It is hard to decide. You should not add “Jerusalem” here.

#### 20:9c

**But fire came down from heaven and consumed them.**

* But fire descended from heaven and consumed them.
* But God caused fire to descend from heaven and burn the army/enemy to ashes.

**But fire came down from heaven:** There is a textual issue in 20:9c: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the phrase out of heaven (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the phrases from God out of heaven (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT recommends it. These verses do not say how the fire came down. It is implied that God caused the fire to come down. In some languages it is more natural to indicate that God caused the fire. For example:

> God caused fire to come down from heaven

**consumed them:** Here the word *consumed* refers to the fire consuming quickly. It can also refer to burning something until it is just ashes. The fire completely destroyed the enemies of God’s people.

**them:** The pronoun here refers to the armies of the nations (20:8a).

* **Associated Passages:** REV 20:9

## Revelation 20:10 (id: 523317)

### Section 20:7–10: Satan rebelled for the last time

In this section, John saw that Satan was set free and left the Abyss. Then Satan deceived people all over the world and led them in a war against God. But God sent fire and the fire killed all the people in Satan’s army. Then God took Satan and threw him into the lake of fire.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> Satan rebelled a last time and God punished him

> The Defeat of Satan (GNT)

> Satan’s last rebellion, defeat, and punishment

#### 20:10a

**And the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur,**

* The Devil/Slanderer, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of fire and burning sulfur,
* Then on God’s behalfsomeone threw the Demon Chief, the deceiver of the nations, into the lake of fiery sulfur.

**the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur:** The clause *who had deceived them* tells the reader more about the *devil*. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are more than one chief leader of demons. It would also indicate that only this one deceived the nations. If that is true in your language, translate these words so that they tell more about the *devil*. For example:

> the devil was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur. He was the one who deceived the nations.

> the devil, the deceiver of the nations, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur

**the devil…was thrown:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. The person who threw might be God, Jesus, or the angels. For example:

> the angels threw the devil, who had deceived the nations

> on God’s behalf someone threw the devil, who had deceived the nations

**devil:** This refers to the leader of the evil spirits, Satan. The Greek word means “slanderer.” See how you translated this word in 20:2\.

**the lake of fire and sulfur:** The BSB literally represents the Greek here. But the *fire and sulfur* were probably mixed together. Sulfur burns readily. Here the phrase has the same meaning as the phrase “the fiery lake of burning sulfur” in 19:20e. The Greek phrase “fire and sulfur” also occurs in 14:10\. See how you translated it there.

#### 20:10b

**into which the beast and the false prophet had already been thrown.**

* where the beast and the false prophet were thrown earlier.
* The rider had thrown the monster and the lying spokesman there earlier.

**into which the beast and the false prophet had already been thrown:** This clause tells the reader more about the lake of burning sulfur. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other lakes of burning sulfur and *the beast and the false prophet* had been thrown only in this one. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about the lake of burning sulfur. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> The beast and the false prophet had been thrown in there.

> This was the place where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown.

**the beast and the false prophet had already been thrown:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> Jesus had thrown the beast and the false prophet

> the rider on the white horse had thrown the beast and the false prophet

**false prophet:** A true *prophet* is a person who speaks the message that God gives to him. A *false prophet* is one who speaks a message that does not come from God. Here this phrase refers to the second beast. Other ways to translate this are:

> deceitful/lying prophet

> he who says he is a prophet but teaches lies

> spokesman for Satan

> false prophecy say\-er

See how you translated this phrase in 16:13 or 19:20\.

#### 20:10c

**There they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.**

* They will be tortured day and night eternally.
* They will suffer in the lake of fiery sulfur all the time forever.

**There they will be tormented:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active or intransitive clause. For example:

> The lake/fire will torment them

> they will be in pain (CEV)

**tormented:** This word refers to causing someone to suffer. See how you translated this word in 11:10 or 14:10\.

**day and night:** This phrase indicates that the devil, the beast, and the false prophet will suffer continually.

**forever and ever:** The Greek phrase is literally “into the ages of the ages.” The word “age” refers to a very long time, so the phrase “the ages of the ages” refers to eternity. For example:

> for timeless ages (JBP)

* **Associated Passages:** REV 20:10

## Revelation 20:11 (id: 523320)

### Section 20:11–15: God judged the dead

In this section, John saw God sitting on his throne. God judged all people according to what they had done. If they had not followed God, he threw them into the lake of fire. These people did not have their names in the Book of Life.

Other examples for this section heading are:

> The Judgment at the Great White Throne (CEV)

> The dead were judged

#### 20:11a

**Then I saw a great white throne and the One seated on it.**

* ¶ Then I saw a great/large white throne and the one seated on it.
* ¶ Then I saw an important/huge place/seat of ruling and God sitting on it.

**great:** The throne is probably called *great* because it is large, beautiful, and important. It is an important throne because it belongs to God.

**throne:** A *throne* is the official chair of a king. When the king is seated on his *throne*, he rules over his people and his country. Therefore, the word is used as a symbol for his authority to rule. Here the word *throne* refers to the place from where God rules.

See how you translated this word in 1:4\.

**the One seated on it:** The word *One* refers to God here.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer to someone other than God. If that is true in your language, you may want to refer to God in your translation. For example:

> God who was seated on it

> God, the one seated on it

#### 20:11b

**Earth and heaven fled from His presence,**

* The earth and sky ran away from him
* Earth and sky and all that is in them vanished from his presence

**Earth and heaven fled from His presence:** This clause is figurative language that describes the disappearance of the earth and sky. It pictures everything being cleared away, perhaps in the sense of clearing out God’s courtroom in preparation for the judging of all people. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> Earth and sky left his presence

> In his presence, earth and sky vanished (NJB)

> Earth and sky ran away from him (NCV)

**Earth and heaven:** Here this phrase probably refers to the whole universe. So all the things in the sky, such as the sun, moon, planets, and stars, are included here. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> all that God created/made

> earth and sky and all that is in them

> the universe

**from His presence:** This phrase is emphasized in the Greek. If possible, emphasize this phrase.

#### 20:11c

**and no place was found for them.**

* and had no place to remain/stay anywhere.
* and disappeared completely.

**no place was found for them:** This clause probably indicates that the earth and sky had completely vanished (as in 21:1b). Other ways to translate this clause are:

> there was no room for them any more (REB)

> were seen no more (GNT)

> disappeared (NCV)

* **Associated Passages:** REV 20:11

## Revelation 20:12 (id: 523322)

### Section 20:11–15: God judged the dead

In this section, John saw God sitting on his throne. God judged all people according to what they had done. If they had not followed God, he threw them into the lake of fire. These people did not have their names in the Book of Life.

Other examples for this section heading are:

> The Judgment at the Great White Throne (CEV)

> The dead were judged

#### 20:12a

**And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne.**

* Then I saw dead people, both important ones and unimportant ones, standing before the throne,
* Then I saw, standing before the place/seat of ruling, those who had died. People of both high and low status were there.

**And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne:** There is a textual issue in 20:12a: (1\) Early Greek manuscripts have the words the throne (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) A few later Greek manuscripts have the word God (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. The conjunction *And* here introduces something else that John saw. For example:

> I also saw… (CEV)

**the dead:** This phrase refers to people who have died. For example:

> all the dead people (CEV)

**great and small:** This phrase refers to people of high status and low status. It implies people of all classes and position in society. The phrase does not refer to physical size. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> great and humble

> both of high and lowly position/place

> Every one of them was there, no matter who they had once been. (CEV)

See how you translated this phrase in 11:18 or 19:18\. The order of the words (“small and great” instead of “great and small”) does not change the meaning of the phrase.

#### 20:12b

**And there were open books,**

* and I saw books being opened.
* Then someone opened books.

#### 20:12b–c

**And there were open books, and one of them was the Book of Life:** In the Greek, these clause are passive. Some languages must use active clauses. God or someone on his behalf opened the books. For example:

> someone opened books. Then someone opened another book

> God had someone open some books. Then God had him open another book

> God opened some books. Then God opened another book

#### 20:12c

**and one of them was the Book of Life.**

* I saw another book being opened, which was the Book of Life.
* Someone also opened another book. It was the book of the people to whom God will give eternal life.

**the Book of Life:** This phrase refers to a *Book* that has in it the names of people to whom God will give eternal *Life*. Some languages must translate the meaning in a more specific way. For example:

> the book in which are the names of those who have eternal life

> the book with/having the names of those to whom God will give eternal life

See how you translated this phrase in 3:5 or 17:8\.

#### 20:12d

**And the dead were judged according to their deeds, as recorded in the books.**

* The dead people were judged by what was written in the books concerning their deeds.
* Then God judged the dead people according to the deeds that they had done. Someone had written their deeds in the books earlier.

**And the dead were judged:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> God judged the dead

**according to their deeds, as recorded in the books:** The verb *recorded* is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. God wrote the names in the books, or had someone write the names in the books. For example:

> what they had done as God had written in the books

> what they had done as God has caused someone to write in the books

**according to their deeds, as recorded:** This phrase indicates that the deeds were written in the books at an earlier time. For example:

> all that they had done, which had been recorded earlier

* **Associated Passages:** REV 20:12

## Revelation 20:13 (id: 523324)

### Section 20:11–15: God judged the dead

In this section, John saw God sitting on his throne. God judged all people according to what they had done. If they had not followed God, he threw them into the lake of fire. These people did not have their names in the Book of Life.

Other examples for this section heading are:

> The Judgment at the Great White Throne (CEV)

> The dead were judged

#### 20:13a–c

This verse explains more about where the dead people came from. The events in this verse occur before God judged people in 20:12\. See the General Comment on 20:12a–13c below.

#### 20:13a

**The sea gave up its dead,**

* The sea gave the dead in it to God.
* For all of the people who had died in the sea were there before the throne,

**The sea gave up its dead:** The Greek clause is literally “The sea gave the dead in it.” It symbolically represents the idea that the people who died in the sea came before God.

In some languages a literal translation would not have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, you should translate the correct meaning. For example:

> Those who died in the sea came

> All of those who had died in the sea were there

> All the dead from the sea came and stood before God

**sea:** The word *sea* refers to a large body of water. A *sea* is often so large that someone standing on one side cannot see the other side. Here the word *sea* refers to seas and oceans in general. See how you translated this word in 5:13 or 18:17\.

#### 20:13b

**and Death and Hades gave up their dead,**

* Hades and all the other places where dead people were also gave the dead in them to God.
* and all of those in the place of the dead and anywhere else were there.

**Death and Hades gave up their dead:** The Greek clause is literally “death and Hades gave the dead in them.” It symbolically represents the idea that the dead people in *Hades* and anywhere else came before God.

In some languages a literal translation would not have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, translate the correct meaning. For example:

> Those held by death or who were in Hades came

> All of those who were in the place of the dead and all the other dead people were there

> All the dead in the afterworld and anywhere else came and stood before God

**Hades:** This word refers to the place where the souls of dead people live before God judges everyone. Some ways to translate *Hades* are:

* Use the name in your language for the place where the souls of dead people live.
* Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > the land/place of the dead people

    > the world of the dead (GNT)

* Use the Greek word and explain it in your translation. For example:

    > Hades, the place of the dead

See how you translated this word in 1:18 or 6:8\.

#### 20:13c

**and each one was judged according to his deeds.**

* Each one was judged by his/her deeds.
* God judged each person according to the deeds he/she had done.

**each one was judged according to his deeds:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. God judged *each one*. For example:

> God judged each person

##### **General Comment on 20:12a–13c**

20:13c repeats most of what 20:12d says. Both verses refer to one event of judging. 20:13a–b says where the dead people came from. Your translation should clearly indicate that 20:12d–13c refers to one event and not two events. You may want to:

* Indicate at the beginning of 20:13a that 20:13a–c explains more about the dead in 20:12a. For example:

    > 13a For the sea gave…

    > 13a Indeed, the sea gave…

* Put 20:13a–c before 20:12a and do not repeat the event of judging. For example:

    > 13aThe sea gave up the dead that were in it, 13band death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them. 12aI saw them all, great and small, standing before the throne, 12band books were opened. 12cAnother book was opened, which is the Book of Life. 12d,13cThe dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books. *You would then mark these words with the combined verse numbers “12–13\.”*

### Section 20:11–15: God judged the dead

In this section, John saw God sitting on his throne. God judged all people according to what they had done. If they had not followed God, he threw them into the lake of fire. These people did not have their names in the Book of Life.

Other examples for this section heading are:

> The Judgment at the Great White Throne (CEV)

> The dead were judged

#### 20:14a

**Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire.**

* Then death and Hades were destroyed by being thrown into the lake of fire.
* Then God commanded someone to throw/fling death and the place of the dead into the lake of fire. And he did.

**Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire:** This clause symbolically indicates that *Death and Hades* will be destroyed so that they will no longer have any effect on people. After this time, no one will die and no one will go to Hades.

In some languages a literal translation would not have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain its meaning in your translation. For example:

    > death and Hades were destroyed by being thrown into the lake of fire

    > death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire and therefore became useless/powerless

* Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:

    > death and Hades were destroyed

    > death and Hades became useless/powerless *You may then want to indicate the literal words in a footnote. An example footnote is:*

    > Literally: “death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire.” These words indicate that death and Hades will be destroyed. They will longer have any effect on people.

* Explain its figurative meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > This saying refers figuratively to death and Hades being destroyed so that they no longer have any effect on people.

**Death and Hades were thrown:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> God threw death and Hades

> they/someone threw death and Hades

> God commanded/caused someone to throw death and Hades

#### 20:14b

**This is the second death—the lake of fire.**

* The lake of fire is what is called the second death.
* The lake of fire is the second time that someone dies.

**This is the second death—the lake of fire:** There is a textual issue in 20:14b: (1\) Early Greek manuscripts have the text This is the second death, the lake of fire (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) One late Greek manuscript has the text This is the second death (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. The first death is when a person’s body dies on earth. The phrase *the second death* refers to being thrown into the lake of fire. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> The lake of fire is what is called the second death

> The lake of fire is the second time of dying

See how you translated the phrase *second death* in 20:6\.

**the second death:** This phrase is emphasized in the Greek. If possible, emphasize this phrase.

* **Associated Passages:** REV 20:14

## Revelation 20:15 (id: 523328)

### Section 20:11–15: God judged the dead

In this section, John saw God sitting on his throne. God judged all people according to what they had done. If they had not followed God, he threw them into the lake of fire. These people did not have their names in the Book of Life.

Other examples for this section heading are:

> The dead were judged

#### 20:15a

**And if anyone was found whose name was not written in the Book of Life,**

* If someone’s name was not seen written in the Book of Life,
* If God did not find a person’s name in the book of those to whom he would give eternal life,

**And if anyone was found whose name was not written in the Book of Life:** The verbs *found* and *written* are both passive. Some ways to translate them are:

* Use a passive clause or clauses. For example:

    > If anyone’s name was not found/seen written in the Book of Life

    > any whose names were not to be found in the Book of Life (REB)

* Use an active clause or clauses. God or someone on his behalf looked in the Book of Life. For example:

    > If God did not find/see someone’s name in the Book of Life

    > If God saw that he had not written someone’s name in the Book of Life

* Translate the meaning only implying “find” and “write.” For example:

    > If someone’s name was not in the Book of Life

**whose name was not written in the Book of Life:** The phrase *not written* indicates that the name did not exist in *the Book of Life*.

#### 20:15b

**he was thrown into the lake of fire.**

* then he was thrown into the lake of fire.
* God flung him into the lake of fire.

**he was thrown into the lake of fire:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> the angels threw him into the lake of fire

> someone/God threw/sent him into the burning lake

> someone, threw/sent him into the burning lake at God’s command

Use the same person or persons here as you did in 20:14\.

**thrown into the lake of fire:** This phrase indicates that the person received the punishment of suffering in the lake of fire at this time.

### Section 21:1–8: John saw the new heaven and earth

In this section, John saw a new heaven, a new earth, and a new Jerusalem. John also heard someone explain that God now lives with his people. The person also spoke about those who did not follow God.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The new heaven and earth descended, and God began living with his people

> All things made new (JBP)

#### 21:1a

**Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth,**

* ¶ I saw a new heaven and a new earth,
* ¶ Next I saw a new creation/universe,

**Then:** The Greek word here is the usual word that indicates that the story continues. However, here it introduces a new part of the story. Use a natural way to introduce a new part of the story in your language.

**a new heaven and a new earth:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *heaven* can also mean “sky” as in 20:11b. Here it probably refers to everything in the universe that surrounds the earth. So the phrase *heaven…and…earth* probably refers to all of creation.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer only to the place where God lives and the place where people live. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Translate the correct meaning in your translation. For example:

    > a new earth and sky and everything else that God newly made

    > a new earth and a new sky and all that is in them

* Translate the literal meaning and explain its meaning in a footnote. For example:

    > This saying refers to a whole new universe.

**a new earth:** The word *earth* refers to the whole world here: the land and sea.

#### 21:1b

**for the first heaven and earth had passed away,**

* because the first heaven and earth no longer existed,
* because the first creation/universe was gone.

**for:** This conjunction introduces the reason that there was a new heaven and earth.

**the first heaven and earth had passed away:** This clause indicates that *the first heaven and earth* no longer existed. For example:

> the first heaven and earth had ceased to exist (NET)

**the first heaven and earth:** This phrase probably refers to the same things as in 20:11b. But there are some English translations that use the English word “sky” instead of *heaven*. In both verses, the phrase refers to all of creation. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> all that God created/made first

> the first earth and sky and all that is in them

> the first universe

**the first heaven:** The word *heaven* here probably has the same meaning as in 21:1a.

#### 21:1c

**and the sea was no more.**

* and there was no sea anymore. (NCV)
* No sea existed on the new earth.

**and the sea was no more:** The Greek clause is literally “no sea existed anymore.” The new earth did not have a sea. In Jewish culture, the sea was a symbol of chaos and evil.Aune (page 1119\) and Beale (page 1042\). So John probably used the sea as a symbol for chaos and evil.

You should translate following the Greek or English. But you may want to explain the implied information in a footnote. For example:

> In Jewish culture, the sea was a symbol of chaos and evil.

**sea:** The word *sea* refers to a large body of water. A *sea* is often so large that someone standing on one side cannot see the other side. Here the word *sea* refers to seas and oceans in general. See how you translated this word in 5:13 or 20:13\.

* **Associated Passages:** REV 21:1

## Revelation 21:2 (id: 523331)

### Section 21:1–8: John saw the new heaven and earth

In this section, John saw a new heaven, a new earth, and a new Jerusalem. John also heard someone explain that God now lives with his people. The person also spoke about those who did not follow God.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The new heaven and earth descended, and God began living with his people

> All things made new (JBP)

#### 21:2a

**I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,**

* I saw the holy city, namely new Jerusalem, descending from heaven from God,
* I saw the new city of Jerusalem, the holy city. It was coming down from heaven from God.

**I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem:** There is a textual issue in 21:2a: (1\) Early Greek manuscripts have the text I saw (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) A few later Greek manuscripts have the text I John saw (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. The new Jerusalem is *the holy city* because it belongs to God and God will live there. Here the word *holy* indicates that the city is dedicated for God’s use. Only his people will live there. Nothing evil will live there. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> I saw the City set apart for God, which is the new Jerusalem

> I saw God’s special City. This is the new Jerusalem

**coming down out of heaven from God:** This phrase tells the reader more about the holy city. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other holy cities and only this one was *coming down out of heaven from God*. If that is true in your language, translate this phrase so that it tells more about the Holy City. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> The city came down from God in heaven.

**heaven:** Here the word *heaven* refers to the place where God lives.

#### 21:2b

**prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.**

* and it was prepared like a bride made beautiful for her husband/man.
* The city was prepared like a woman adorned for the man she is about to marry.

**prepared as a bride adorned for her husband:** This phrase symbolically compares the new Jerusalem to a woman about to be married. Like a bride makes herself ready for the wedding, so the new Jerusalem is ready to marry.

In some languages it is more natural to translate 21:2b as a separate sentence. For example:

> It was prepared like a bride dressed for her husband. (NCV)

**prepared:** Here the word *prepared* means “was made ready.” The city was ready in the way that a bride is ready to meet her husband. For example:

> dressed like a bride ready for her husband (GW)

> like a bride dressed in her wedding gown and ready to meet her husband. (CEV)

The clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> others/they made her ready

**bride:** This word refers to a woman who is about to marry.

**adorned:** The Greek word that the BSB literally translates as *adorned* refers to wearing a beautiful dress and jewelry. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> beautifully dressed (NIV)

> made beautiful

**her husband:** Here the word *husband* refers to the man about to marry his bride.

### Section 21:1–8: John saw the new heaven and earth

In this section, John saw a new heaven, a new earth, and a new Jerusalem. John also heard someone explain that God now lives with his people. The person also spoke about those who did not follow God.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The new heaven and earth descended, and God began living with his people

> All things made new (JBP)

#### 21:3a

**And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying:**

* Then I heard loud speech coming from the throne saying,
* And I heard someone from the place/seat of ruling say loudly,

**a loud voice from the throne saying:** There is a textual issue in 21:3a: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the words the throne (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some later Greek manuscripts have the word heaven (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. John does not say who spoke here, but it probably does not refer to God (21:3b) Translate this phrase so that it refers to someone other than God. For example:

> someone’s loud speech from the throne which said

> someone shouted from the throne

**the throne:** This word refers to the official chair of a king. It is a symbol of his power to rule. See how you translated *throne* in 1:4 or 19:5\.

#### 21:3b

**“Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man, and He will dwell with them.**

* “Look/Listen, God’s place to live is now with people, and he will live with them.
* “Indeed/Hey, the place where God lives is now with people. He will certainly live with them.

**Behold:** The Greek word is literally “Look.” The Greek word emphasizes or calls attention to the words that follow. It is not a command to look at something. Other ways to translate this word are:

> Indeed/Hey,

> Listen,

**the dwelling place of God is with man, and He will dwell with them:** These two clauses have similar meanings. In Greek, repeating clauses of similar meaning emphasizes that meaning.

In some languages repeating a similar meaning has a different use. If that is true in your language, you may want to emphasize the meaning in a different way. For example:

> God will indeed dwell with people

> God will certainly live with humankind

**dwelling place:** This word refers to a place to live. Here it refers to where God lives.

**man:** Here this word refers to people in general.

#### 21:3c

**They will be His people, and God Himself will be with them as their God.**

* They will be his people, and he himself will be there with them and will be their God.
* They will belong to him. God himself will live among them. He will be their God.

**They will be His people:** The people will have a relationship with God. They will belong to God.

**God Himself will be with them:** This clause indicates that God will actually be present among them; it will not just be a symbolic representation of him, as the temple in Jerusalem represented his presence.

**as their God:** There is a textual issue here:

1. Some Greek manuscripts include the words and be their God. For example:

    > God himself will be with them, and he will be their God (GNT) *(BSB. NIV, GNT, NJB, NRSV, GW, NCV, ESV, KJV)*

2. Some Greek manuscripts omit those words. For example:

    > God himself will be with them; (RSV) *(RSV, NASB, NLT, CEV, NET, REB)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\).The UBS Greek NT support option (1\), but indicates that the committee had difficulty deciding which option was best. But if the major language version follows option (2\), you may want to follow that.

In this section, John saw a new heaven, a new earth, and a new Jerusalem. John also heard someone explain that God now lives with his people. The person also spoke about those who did not follow God.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

#### 21:4a

**‘He will wipe away every tear from their eyes,’**

* He will wipe all their tears away.
* He will remove all their grief and sorrow.

**He will wipe away every tear from their eyes:** This clause implies that God’s people will not be sad again. In some languages a literal translation would not imply that. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Include this implied information in your translation. For example:

    > He will wipe away every tear from their eyes so that they will not be sad ever again

* Translate the meaning with this implied information. For example:

    > He will remove all their grief and sorrow

    > God will comfort them so that they never cry/weep again

See how you translated a similar clause in 7:17\.

#### 21:4b

**and there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain,**

* People will no longer die. They will not be sad, or cry, or have pain,

**and there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain:** The Greek words are literally “death will not be/exist anymore, nor grief nor crying nor pain will be/exist anymore.” No one will experience any of these things in the new Jerusalem. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> Death will be no more; mourning and crying and pain will be no more (NRSV)

> death will not exist any more—or mourning, or crying, or pain (NET)

> No one will experience dying, grief, weeping, or pain

In some languages it is more natural to translate the nouns *death*, *mourning*, *crying*, and *pain* as verbs. For example:

> No one will ever die. No one will mourn, or cry, or suffer

**mourning or crying:** These words refer to weeping, that is, tears in the eyes because of sadness.

#### 21:4c

**for the former things have passed away.”**

* for the first things have passed away.” (NRSV)
* because the old things and their ways no longer exist.”

**for:** This conjunction introduces the reason that there will be no more death, mourning, crying, or pain.

**the former things have passed away:** This clause refers to the way of life on the first earth. That way of life included death, mourning, crying, and pain. Now all that has ended. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> the first things have disappeared (GW)

> the former things have ceased to exist (NET)

> all the old ways are gone (NCV)

### Section 21:1–8: John saw the new heaven and earth

In this section, John saw a new heaven, a new earth, and a new Jerusalem. John also heard someone explain that God now lives with his people. The person also spoke about those who did not follow God.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The new heaven and earth descended, and God began living with his people

#### 21:5a

**And the One seated on the throne said, “Behold, I make all things new.”**

* ¶ He who sat on the throne said, “Look/Listen/Hey, I make all things new!”

**And the One seated on the throne:** This phrase refers to God (21:7b). John described him here instead of referring to him directly. For example:

> the One sitting on the throne (NJB)

John named God as the being seated on the throne in other verses (for example, 19:4\). It should be clear here that the words *the One* refer to God. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer to someone else. If that is true in your language, imply or indicate that the phrase refers to God. For example:

> The One who sits on the throne and rules everything

> The great/greatest One who sits on the throne

> God, sitting on the/his throne,

See how you translated a similar phrase “the One seated on the throne” in 6:16\.

**Behold, I make all things new:** The Greek clause here begins with the word “look” (as in the NJB). The BSB translates this Greek word as *Behold*. The word emphasizes or calls attention to the words that follow. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> Look/Listen, I am making the whole creation new

> Indeed/Hey, I am making all things new

#### 21:5b

**Then He said, “Write this down, for these words are faithful and true.”**

* Then he said, “Write that, because those words are reliable and true.”
* Then he said to me, “Write that. For those words can be trusted and those words are true.”

**Then He said:** God spoke to John here. For example:

> He also said to me (GNT)

**Write this down:** This clause refers back to 21:5a or to 21:3b–5a. In some languages it is more natural to use the word “that” or “those” when referring back. For example:

> Write that

> Write those things

**for:** This conjunction introduces the reason that God commanded John to write down those words.

**faithful:** This word refers to something one can depend on. What God said will certainly happen. Other ways to translate this word are:

> reliable (NET)

> can be trusted (GNT)

## Revelation 21:6 (id: 523340)

### Section 21:1–8: John saw the new heaven and earth

In this section, John saw a new heaven, a new earth, and a new Jerusalem. John also heard someone explain that God now lives with his people. The person also spoke about those who did not follow God.

Other examples of headings for this section are:

> The new heaven and earth descended, and God began living with his people

> All things made new (JBP)

#### 21:6a

**And He told me, “It is done!**

* ¶ Then he said to me, “All those things have now occurred.
* ¶ He said to me, “Now everything has happened which must happen.

**It is done!:** The Greek clause is literally “(They) have happened.” This clause indicates that all the things that God promised to happen for his people have now happened. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> It is finished (NCV)

> All those things have occurred

#### 21:6b

**I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End.**

* I am the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and End.
* I am the First and Last over all things, I am the Beginning and End of authority.

**I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End:** This clause has two titles. The title *the Alpha and the Omega* and the title *the Beginning and the End* are similar in meaning. Together they emphasize that God is eternal and controls all that happens in history.

**I am the Alpha and the Omega:** *Alpha* is the name of the first letter of the Greek alphabet. *Omega* is the name of the last letter of that alphabet. Here the phrase *the Alpha and the Omega* is used as a title. It is also a figure of speech. So this saying probably indicates that:

1. God is eternal.
2. He has authority over the beginning and the end of all things. This implies that everything in between the beginning and the end is also under his authority. He has control over all things and events.

In some languages a literal translation would not have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:

    > I am the One with authority over the first things and the last things

    > I am the One with all authority from start to finish *You may then want to indicate the literal words and their meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:*

    > Literally: “the Alpha and the Omega.” Alpha and Omega are the names of the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet. This phrase is an idiom. It indicates that God exists eternally and has authority over all things.

* Substitute the first and the last letters of your own alphabet. For example:

    > I am the A and the Z (GW) *You may then want to indicate the literal words and its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:*

    > Literally: “the Alpha and the Omega.” Alpha and Omega are the names of the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet. This phrase is an idiom. It indicates that God exists eternally and controls all things.

* Translate the literal meaning and explain its meaning in your translation. For example:

    > I am the Alpha and the Omega, which means I am the One with authority over the first things and the last things

    > I am the Alpha and the Omega, that is, the One who is in control from start to finish

* Translate the literal meaning and explain its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Alpha and Omega are the names of the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet. This phrase is an idiom. It indicates that God exists eternally and controls all things.

This title is similar in meaning to the titles “The First and the Last” (1:17, 2:8, 22:13\) and “The Beginning and End” (21:6, 22:13\). If possible, you should translate the three titles in similar but different ways. This is helpful, because all three titles appear in 22:13\.

See how you translated this phrase in 1:8\.

**the Beginning and the End:** The title *the Beginning and the End* indicates figuratively that God has authority over all things. It is similar in meaning to the title “the Alpha and the Omega.”

In some languages a literal translation would not have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain its meaning in your translation. For example:

    > the Beginning of all things and the End of all things

    > the Beginning and the End, which means I have all authority

* Translate the literal meaning and explain its meaning in a footnote. For example:

    > The saying “the Beginning and the End” indicates that God has authority over all things.

#### 21:6c

**To the thirsty I will give freely**

* To anyone who is thirsty, I will give the right to drink for free
* To all who are thirsty, I will permit them to drink water without paying

**To the thirsty I will give freely:** The clause *I will give freely* indicates that God will allow this person to drink. For example:

> To anyone who is thirsty I will give the right to drink (GNT)

**To the thirsty:** God spoke this phrase to anyone who seeks him. For example:

> To all who are thirsty (NLT)

**freely:** This phrase indicates that God gives the right to drink for free. He does not require people to pay something first. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> free (NJB)

> without paying for it (GNT)

#### 21:6d

**from the spring of the water of life.**

* from the spring of life\-giving water.
* from the spring out of which flows the water of eternal life.

**spring:** Here the word *spring* refers to a place where water arises out of the ground.

**the water of life:** This phrase indicates that the water is a source of eternal life. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> water that gives eternal life

> life\-giving water

See how you translated a similar phrase in 7:17 (“living water”).

**The one who overcomes will inherit all things,**

* Anyone who gains victory will receive those promises,
* You(plur) who defeat everything that causes a believer to stumble, those things promised to you will become yours.

#### 21:7b

**and I will be his God, and he will be My son.**

* and I will be his God, and he will be my son/child.
* Also I will be your(plur) God, and you will be my children.

#### 21:7a–b

**The one who overcomes will inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he will be My son:** Here the words *The one*, *his*, *he*, and *son* refer to every man and woman who overcomes. For example:

> The person who overcomes will inherit all this, and I will be his God and he will be my child

> Those who win the victory will receive this from me: I will be their God, and they will be my children. (GNT)

**overcomes:** This word means “triumphs” or “obtains/wins victory.” Here the word refers to having success over sin, evil, and pressure to turn away from Jesus. Other ways to translate this word are:

> conquers (RSV)

> are victorious (NLT)

Some languages need to say what a believer *overcomes*. If that is true in your language, you should refer generally to “evil” or “sin.” For example:

> defeat evil

> has victory over sin

> conquers anything that causes a believer to stumble

See how you translated this word in 2:7 or 3:5\.

**inherit:** Here the Greek word that the BSB translates as *inherit* refers to a person being given something because it has been promised to him. Here it refers to beginning to live in the new Jerusalem and receiving all the other blessings that God promised to those who believe in Jesus. Other ways to translate this are:

> take as your heritage

> receiveIn some languages “take” and “receive” is translated by the same verb. The English verb “receive” implies that someone gave the inheritance, but the English verb “take” does not imply that. Your translation should imply or indicate that someone gave it.

> will be given (CEV)

**all things:** There is a textual issue in 21:7a: (1\) Early Greek manuscripts have the word these (RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) A few late Greek manuscripts have the word all (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. The BSB uses the phrase “all things,” but the Greek text for the translation has the word “these.” The Greek word is literally “these (things).” It refers to the promises in 21:1–6\. Since it refers back, in some languages it is more natural to use “that” or “those” here. For example:

> those promises

> all that

> these blessings (CEV)

**But to the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable**

* But cowards, those without faith, people who do detestable things,
* But those who are afraid to follow Jesus, those who refuse to believe in me, those who do terrible/abhorrent things,

**the cowardly:** This phrase usually refers to people who are afraid to do things. For example:

> cowards (NLT)

Here it refers to people who are afraid to obey God. They are afraid of persecution and so they do not follow Jesus.

In some languages a literal translation would not imply the correct meaning here. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > those afraid of persecution

* Translate the literal meaning and explain its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Here “the cowardly” probably refers to people who are afraid of persecution. So they do not follow Jesus.

**unbelieving:** This phrase refers to people who choose not to believe in Jesus. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> unbelievers (NLT)

> detestable people (GW)

#### 21:8b

**and murderers and sexually immoral**

* murderers, adulterers/fornicators,
* those who murder others, those who commit/do sexual immorality,

**murderers:** This phrase refers to people who kill others deliberately and unlawfully. See how you translated the noun “murder” in 9:21 for a similar idea. But note that the word here refers to the people who commit these murders.

**sexually immoral:** This phrase refers to people who have sexual relations with anyone who is not their spouse. The word refers to both men and women. Use a word or phrase that refers to all kinds of sexual sin. For example:

> adulterers/fornicators

> those who sin sexually

#### 21:8c

**and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars,**

* sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars
* those who do witchcraft/sorcery, those who worship idols, and all those who lie

**sorcerers:** This phrase refers to people who do sorcery. The word refers to any method to get something by supernatural means. This could include using spells, magic potions, and contacting evil spirits. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> those who practice magic arts (NIV)

> those who practice/do sorcery or magic

See how you translated a similar phrase in 9:21 (“sorcery”).

**idolaters:** This phrase refers to people who consider certain images or statues to be gods or represent gods. They worship and pray to them. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> those who worship idols (GNT)

> worshippers of false gods (NJB)

#### 21:8d

**their place will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur.**

* will have a place in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur,
* will go to the lake where fire and sulfur burns and remain there.

**their place will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur:** This clause indicates that the sinners will go to this evil place and remain there. This will be their home. They will not be able to leave. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> the place for them is the lake burning with fire and sulfur (GNT)

> their fate is in the fiery lake of burning sulfur (NLT)

**the lake that burns with fire and sulfur:** The Greek phrase is literally “the lake burning with fire and sulfur.” The phrase here has the same meaning as the phrase “the fiery lake of burning sulfur” in 19:20e. The phrase “the lake of fire and sulfur” in 20:10a has the same meaning also. For example:

> the lake that burns with fire and sulfur (NRSV)

#### 21:8e

**This is the second death.”**

* which is the second death.”
* Being in that lake is the second time that someone dies.”

**This:** This word refers to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. Other ways to translate this word are:

> That place

> which (GNT)

**the second death:** The first death is when a person dies on earth and his body dies. The phrase *the second death* refers to being thrown into the lake of fire (20:14–15\). Other ways to translate this clause are:

> called the second death

> the second time of dying

### Section 21:9–22:5: An angel showed the new Jerusalem to John

In this section, an angel showed the new Jerusalem to John. The angel again used a metaphor of a bride to describe new Jerusalem. The city was large and beautiful. God lived there with his people. His glory lighted the city. John described the city, the river that flowed through the city, and the tree that gave life. There were no bad things in the city at all.

Other examples for this section heading are:

* ¶ One of the seven angels who earlier had emptied one of the seven bowls
* ¶ Then one of the seven angels with/holding the bowls

#### 21:9b

**full of the seven final plagues came and said to me,**

* full of the seven last disasters came to me and said,
* that had been filled with the final seven plagues came to me. He said,

#### 21:9a–b

**Then one of the seven angels with the seven bowls full of the seven final plagues:** This is the same phrase as in 17:1, except that the phrase *full of the seven final plagues* is added here. It refers to the seven angels of chapter 16\.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that the bowls were still full of the plagues. If that is true in your language, indicate that the bowls no longer have the plagues in them. For example:

> One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls which earlier were full of the seven last plagues came and said to me

> Earlier/Previously I had seen seven angels holding seven bowls filled with the final seven plagues/disasters. Now one of them came to me and said

#### 21:9c

**“Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.”**

* “Come, and I will show to you(sing) the bride and now wife of the Lamb.”
* “Come, and I will show to you the bride, the wife of the Lamb, namely, the new Jerusalem.”

**the bride, the wife of the Lamb:** The phrase *the bride* and the phrase *the wife of the Lamb* are similar in meaning. Both refer to the new Jerusalem. Repeating a similar meaning in Greek emphasizes that meaning.

In some languages repeating a similar meaning has a different use. If that is true in your language, you may want to emphasize the meaning in a different way. For example:

> the bride who is the wife of the Lamb

> the bride that the Lamb has married (NJB)

> indeed the new wife of the Lamb

**the bride, the wife:** The word *bride* can refer to a woman about to be married or a woman recently married. The word *wife* usually refers to a woman who has recently married. But here it is implied that the wedding of the Lamb has not yet occurred.Kistemaker (page 563\), Beckwith (page 757\), and Exegetical Summaries (on TW). Kistemaker refers to the Jewish custom of betrothal, where the woman was legally the man’s wife but they were not yet living together or sharing a bed. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that the bride was already married. If that is true in your language, indicate that the marriage is soon.

**the Lamb:** This is a title for Jesus. Jewish people killed a lamb at the Passover as a sacrifice to God. The lamb has symbolic meaning as a special sacrifice and is a symbol for the Christ. See how you translated this title in 5:6 or 19:7\.

In some languages readers would not clearly understand a literal translation as a title for Jesus. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain in a footnote that the word *Lamb* is a title for Jesus as the Christ. For example:

> This word is a symbolic title for Jesus. It indicates that he was like the lambs that the Jewish people sacrificed to God at every Passover Feast. Like those lambs, he died at Passover as a sacrifice to God.

> See the footnote on “the Lamb” at 5:6\.

His glory lighted the city. John described the city, the river that flowed through the city, and the tree that gave life. There were no bad things in the city at all.

**And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high,**

* Then he took/carried me with the help of the Spirit to a big, high mountain
* Then the angel took me by the Holy Spirit’s power to a huge and tall mountain.

**carried me away in the Spirit:** In English Bibles, the titles and names of God normally begin with an uppercase (capital) letter. But ancient Greek writers used only one style of letters. So the Greek word that the BSB translates as *Spirit* can refer to either the human spirit or God’s Spirit. There are two ways to interpret it:

1. It indicates that the Holy Spirit took John places during the events of 21:10–22:5\. For example:

    > And in the Spirit he carried me away (RSV) *(BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NASB, NLT, CEV, NET, ESV, NCV)*

2. It indicates that John’s spirit (as opposed to his physical body) experienced the events of 21:10–22:5\. For example:

    > He took me in spirit (NJB) *(NJB, NRSV, NABRE, REB, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), as in 1:10, 4:2, and 17:3\.Beale (page 1065\) and Osbourne (page 746\) support interpretation (1\).

The clause implies that John’s experience in 1:10 continues but at a new location. Other ways to translate this clause following interpretation (1\) are:

> And the angel carried me away by the Spirit (NCV)

> with the help of the Spirit, he took me (CEV)

See how you translated this clause in 17:3\.

**a mountain great and high:** The BSB has the describing words *great* and *high* after the *mountain* they describe. This copies the Greek word order. It is also an English poetic style. You may want to follow the usual word order of your language. For example:

> a great, high mountain (RSV)

#### 21:10b

**and showed me the holy city of Jerusalem**

* and showed to me the holy city, namely Jerusalem,
* He showed to me Jerusalem, the holy city,

#### 21:10c

**coming down out of heaven from God,**

* descending from heaven from God.
* as it came down from God in heaven.

#### 21:10b–c

**the holy city of Jerusalem:** There is a textual issue in 21:10b: (1\) Some early Greek manuscripts have the word holy (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some later Greek manuscripts have the words great and holy (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. The new Jerusalem is the *holy city* because it belongs to God and God will live there. Here the word *holy* indicates that the city is dedicated for God’s use. His people will live there. Nothing evil will live there. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

### Section 21:9–22:5: An angel showed the new Jerusalem to John

In this section, an angel showed the new Jerusalem to John. The angel again used a metaphor of a bride to describe new Jerusalem. The city was large and beautiful. God lived there with his people. His glory lighted the city. John described the city, the river that flowed through the city, and the tree that gave life. There were no bad things in the city at all.

#### 21:11a

**shining with the glory of God.**

* God’s glory/splendor shone from it,
* God’s glory/radiance made the city shine

**shining with the glory of God:** The Greek words are literally “having the glory of God” (as in the RSV). The glory of God caused the city to shine brilliantly (21:11b–c). For example:

> The glory of God made the city bright (CEV)

**glory:** This word refers to brightness. It symbolizes greatness, power, splendor, and majesty. Other ways to translate this word are:

> splendor

> radiance

See how you translated this word in 15:8\.

#### 21:11b

**Its radiance was like a most precious jewel, like a jasper,**

* and its radiance/ brightness was like a most rare jewel, like jasper,
* so that it gleamed/glittered like a precious stone, like a polished jasper stone,

**radiance:** This word refers to the brightness of the shining city.

**a most precious jewel:** This phrase refers to a rare and beautiful stone. Such a stone is *precious*, that is, very valuable and rare. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> a most rare jewel (RSV)

> a precious stone (GNT)

> a valuable gem (GW)

**jasper:** This word refers to a spotted or veined stone of a variety of colors. It is often a reddish color, but it can also be deep green, brown, or deep yellow. It shines brightly in the sun. Light reflects off its surface. Light does not shine through this stone like it does through glass.

In some languages people are not familiar with *jasper*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use the name for a kind of stone similar to how *jasper* is described above. The important thing is that it should be considered bright and beautiful.

Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

> a spotted/veined stone named jasper

* Use the major language word for the stone. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Jasper is a spotted or veined stone that is deep red, green, or yellow. It shines brightly.

See how you translated this word in 4:3\. Or see the note and picture of *jasper* at 4:3\.

#### 21:11c

**as clear as crystal.**

* and like crystal.
* and dazzling/sparkling like a crystal.

**as clear as crystal:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *as clear as crystal* is a rare word that probably means “shine/be like crystal.” Glass is see\-through but jasper is not, so the city probably shined like crystal shines. John described the city with the words “glory” (21:11a) and “radiance” (21:11b). So the Greek word probably indicates that the city was brilliant and sparkling. It may imply free of impurities. For example:

> with the clear light of crystal (JBP)

> dazzling/sparkling like crystal

Many English versions translate similarly to the BSB. But *clear* does not seem to be the meaning here. You may want to indicate that the city was like crystal without saying how it was like crystal. For example:

> like crystal

**crystal:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *crystal* refers to various substances that are bright, shiny, and have flat surfaces. (See drawing at 4:6\.) The Greek word probably refers only to crystals that let light shine through them. Quartz, diamond, and sapphire are examples of crystals. Here the focus is on the fact that a *crystal* is shiny. It is not clear if it implies letting light shine through it.

In some languages people are not familiar with a *crystal*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use the characteristics of a crystal that are important here. For example:

    > with bright/sparkling surfaces

    > bright/sparkling

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, you may want to explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > A crystal is a hard substance that is see\-through, shiny, and has flat surfaces.

#### 21:12a

**The city had a great and high wall with twelve gates**

* It had a big, high wall with twelve gates/gateways, and
* Around the city was a huge and tall wall with/having twelve gates/gateways.

#### 21:12b

**inscribed with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel,**

* there were names written on the gates/gateways, the names of the twelve clans of Israel.
* The names of the twelve clans of Israel were on the gates/gateways, one name on each gate/gateway.

#### 21:12a–b

**The city had a great and high wall:** This wall surrounded the city. In John’s time, a city wall helped protect the city from foreign armies. Here it is probably symbolic to indicate God’s protection for all who live in the city.

**with twelve gates inscribed with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel:** The Greek words are literally “and names having been written on/in, which are the names of the twelve tribes/clans of the sons of Israel.” One name was written on each gate. So in some languages it is more natural to indicate that each gate had one name. For example:

> On each gate was written the name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel

**with twelve gates:** The names may have been written:

1. on the gates themselves,
2. on the stones of the arch that forms the gateway,
3. on the wall above the gateway.

Translate this phrase so that it allows one or more of the above meanings. For example:

> upon the gates

> over the gates (NJB)

> over the twelve gateways (JBP)

**twelve gates:** The Greek word here probably refers to gateways (as in the JBP). The gates themselves are described in 21:21a.

**inscribed with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel:** The Greek words are literally “and names having been written, which are the names of the twelve tribes/clans of Israel.” This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active or intransitive clause. For example:

> God had inscribed/written the names of the twelve tribes/clans of Israel on the gates

> God had inscribed/written the name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel on each gate

> and names were on the gates/gateways, the names of the twelve tribes/clans of Israel

> The names of the twelve tribes/clans of Israel were on the gates/gateways

Your translation should indicate or imply that the names were written. Indicate or imply that people could see the names.

**the twelve tribes of Israel:** The founder of the Jewish people was Jacob. God gave him the name Israel. Israel had twelve sons. Each of these sons became the head of a family group. Each group used the name of the son who founded that group. Use the usual word for that kind of group. For example:

> twelve clans of Israel

#### 21:12c

**and twelve angels at the gates.**

* and twelve angels were at these gates.
* An angel stood by each gate/gateway.

**twelve angels at the gates:** One angel stood at each gate.

* three gates were in the south part of the wall, and three gates were in the west part of the wall.

#### 21:13a–b

**There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south, and three on the west:** The Greek words are literally “from the east three gates, from the north three gates, from the south three gates, and from the west three gates.” The city wall surrounded the city in the shape of a square. Each part of the wall had three gates in it. For example:

> on the east three gates, on the north three gates, on the south three gates, and on the west three gates (RSV)

#### 21:14a

**The wall of the city had twelve foundations**

* The wall of the city had twelve foundations under it,
* The wall surrounding the city stood on twelve foundation stones,

**The wall of the city had twelve foundations:** It is not clear where each of these twelve foundations were in relationship to each other. Some possibilities are:

1. The twelve stones were side by side under the whole city and its wall.
2. The stones lay end to end around the city under the wall so that there were three stones to each side.
3. The foundations were in twelve layers, one on top of another.

Translate in a way that allows these interpretations. For example:

> The wall of the city had twelve foundations under it

> The city walls stood on twelve foundation stones (NJB)

> The city’s wall was built on twelve foundation stones (GNT)

**The wall of the city:** This wall is the wall that surrounded the city (21:12a).

**foundations:** A *foundation* is the first layer of a building or construction. It is usually partly buried so that it will not move. But in this case, John saw all twelve foundations. Some languages do not have a word for *foundation*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use the word in your language for the first layer of construction when building a strong wall or house. The word must be appropriate for building a wall on top of it.

Describe in your translation how a *foundation* is used. For example:

> twelve large stones under it which were secure in the ground

> twelve large stones partly buried in the ground to make the wall strong

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > A foundation is the first layer of a building or construction. It is usually partly buried so that it will not move and cause the building to collapse.

#### 21:14b

**bearing the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.**

* and on them were the names of the Lamb’s twelve apostles.
* and each foundation stone had one of the names of the Lamb’s twelve apostles on it.

**bearing the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb:** There is a textual issue in 21:14b: (1\) Early Greek manuscripts have the word on (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) A few late Greek manuscripts have the word in (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. The Greek is literally “and on them, names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.” The phrase “on them” is emphasized in the Greek. Some English versions also emphasize this phrase. For example:

> and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb (NIV)

However, the BSB translates these words with the English word *bearing*. Do what is most natural in your language.

**apostles:** In general, the Greek word that the BSB translates as *apostles* refers to those sent with a message. They are representatives or messengers of a higher authority. Here it refers to twelve men whom Jesus chose to take his message to the world.

Some ways to translate this word are:

* Translate the meaning. For example:

    > representatives

    > special messengers

    > sent\-people

* Use the major language word or phrase.

#### 21:15a

**The angel who spoke with me had a golden measuring rod**

* ¶ The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod made of gold
* ¶ The angel who talked to me had a golden measuring stick/reed.

**golden measuring rod:** There is a textual issue in 21:15a: (1\) Early Greek manuscripts have the words measuring rod (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some later Greek manuscripts have the word rod. For example, the KJV says: “reed” (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. The word *golden* indicates that the measuring rod was made of gold. For example:

> gold measuring stick (GNT)

**golden:** The word *golden* refers to a rare metal of a somewhat yellow color. It was the most expensive metal at that time. It is naturally shiny and beautiful. See how you translated this word in 1:12 or 18:12\.

**measuring rod:** This refers to a straight stick that is used for measuring distances. See how you translated this phrase in 11:1\.

#### 21:15b

**to measure the city and its gates and walls.**

* to measure the size of the city, its gates, and its walls.
* He used the stick/reed’s length to measure how big/large the city, the gates, and its surrounding wall were.

**to measure the city:** When someone would *measure* something, he would find out how big it is. Here a person would use a straight stick of a particular length. He would count the number of times he laid the stick on the ground as he moves from one end to the other end.

In some languages the word “count” is used here for the meaning of *measure*. For example:

> to count the distance/size of the city

See how you translated the word *measure* in 11:1\.

**its…walls:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *walls* is singular, “wall.” It refers to the wall that surrounds the city. In some languages it is more natural to use the singular here. For example:

> its wall (NASB)

> the wall that surrounds it

**The city lies foursquare, with its width the same as its length.**

* The city was square in shape, with/having its length equal to its width.
* The base/land of the city was square and its sides were of equal length.

#### 21:16b

**And he measured the city with the rod,**

* He used the measuring rod to measure the city,
* He measured the city.

#### 21:16a–b

**The city lies foursquare:** The Greek clause is literally “the city lies square.” The land that the city rested on was square in shape. For example:

> The city was square. (GW)

**with its width the same as its length:** This phrase could mean that the city was shaped as a cube or as a pyramid. The words only describe the base or foundation as a square. So, do not describe the shape of the city.

#### 21:16c

**and all its dimensions were equal—12,000 stadia in length**

* and the city was twelve thousand stadia long,
* He found/saw/discovered its length to be 2,220 kilometers.

#### 21:16d

**and width and height.**

* and it was as wide and high as it was long.
* Its width and its height were equal to its length.

#### 21:16c–d

**12,000 stadia:** A Roman distance unit of measure was the stadium (plural is *stadia*). It is about 185 meters (607 feet). So *12,000 stadia* is about 2,220 kilometers (1,380 miles). You may want to:

* Use the Roman measure, as the BSB does. You may then want to explain the distance in a footnote. For example:

    > This is about 2,200 kilometers.

    > About 1,400 miles.

* Use the common measure in your area. For example:

    > 2,200 kilometers

    > 1,400 miles

    > 2,900,000 paces

    > the distance of walking 560 hours *You may then want to explain the literal words in a footnote. For example:*

    > Literally: “12,000 stadia.” The Roman measure of a stadium (plural is “stadia”) is about 185 meters.

**And he measured its wall to be 144 cubits,**

* He measured the height of its wall, and it was one hundred and forty\-four cubits,
* The angel also measured the city’s wall. It was sixty\-six meters high.

**And he measured its wall to be 144 cubits:** The Greek does not say which measurement of the wall is *144 cubits*. The BSB and some English versions (RSV, NASB, NABRE, GW, NET, ESV, KJV) translate the Greek literally. For example, the RSV says:

> He also measured its wall, a hundred and forty\-four cubits

Other English versions interpret this measurement in two ways:

1. The measurement refers to the height of the wall. For example:

    > He measured its wall, and this was a hundred and forty\-four cubits high (NJB) *(GNT, NJB, CEV, REB, NCV)*

2. The measurement refers to the thickness of the wall, as in the BSB. For example:

    > Then he measured the walls and found them to be 216 feet thick (NLT) *(NIV, NLT)*

If you interpret this measurement, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because 21:12 speaks of a great, high wall.Beale (page 1076\) and Swete (page 289\) say it is probably the height of the wall. Hughes (on TW) is definite that it refers to the height. Beckwith (page 761\) says, “The indefinite expression would most naturally be taken of length or height, and (length) is excluded here.”

**144 cubits:** A “cubit” is a measure of length from a man’s fingertip to his elbow. One cubit is about 45 centimeters (1\.5 feet). So this phrase refers to about 66 meters (216 feet). You may want to:

* Use the Jewish unit of measure as the BSB does. You may then want to explain the distance in a footnote. For example:

    > This is about 66 meters.

    > This is 216 feet.

* Use the common unit of measure in your area. For example:

    > 66 meters

    > 216 feet (GNT)

    > 86 paces *You may then want to explain the literal words in a footnote. For example:*

    > Literally: “144 cubits.” The cubit is the Jewish unit of measure of length. It is the length from the fingertip to the elbow (about 45 centimeters).

#### 21:17b

**by the human measure the angel was using.**

* using the human cubit measurement.
* (The angel used the measure that people use.)

**by the human measure:** This phrase indicates that the angel used the cubit that people use. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> by man’s measurement (NIV)

> according to the cubit used by people

**The wall was made of jasper,**

* The wall was made of jasper stone,
* The wall was made of polished jasper.

**jasper:** This word refers to a spotted or veined stone of a variety of colors. It is often a reddish color, but can also be deep green, brown, or deep yellow. See how you translated this word in 21:11\.

#### 21:18b

**and the city itself of pure gold, as pure as glass.**

* and the city was made of pure gold, like clean/pure glass.
* The city was made of pure gold, which was as clean/pure as glass.

**the city itself of pure gold:** This phrase indicates that everything in the *city* was made of *pure gold*. This would include the buildings and at least the main street (21:21b).

**pure gold:** The word *pure* refers to something without dirt or blemish. The gold had nothing else in it.

**as pure as glass:** There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as *pure*:

1. The phrase indicates that the gold is very pure. For example:

    > as pure as glass (NCV) *(BSB, NIV, REB, NCV)*

2. The phrase indicates the gold is see\-through. For example:

    > as clear as glass (GNT) *(RSV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NABRE, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, ESV, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because the word *pure* should be understood in the same way here as in the phrase “pure gold.”BDAG and other Greek dictionaries list the meanings as “clean, pure.” The meaning “clear/transparent” is not a part of the meaning of the Greek word. Beale (page 1079\), Lenski (page 639\), Hughes (on TW), and Swete (page 290\) support interpretation (1\). Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> with the brilliance of glass (JBP)

> bright as clear glass (REB)

The Greek word also means “clean.” John probably implies that the city is acceptable to God. The Jews and Jesus used the word “clean” in the same way (Matthew 23:26, Luke 11:41, John 13:10\) The gold of the city is completely without dirt or blemish. For example:

> as clean as glass

**The foundations of the city walls were adorned with every kind of precious stone:**

* The foundation stones under the city walls were made beautiful with/using the most precious stones.

**The foundations of the city walls were adorned with:** This clause is passive. God caused the foundations to be decorated. Some languages must use an active or intransitive clause. For example:

> God had adorned the foundations of the city walls with

> God had caused the foundations of the city walls to be beautiful with

> The foundations of the city walls were

**were adorned:** Here, the Greek word probably indicates that God *adorned* these foundation stones by making each foundation out of one gemstone (jasper, sapphire, and so on).Beale (page 1082–1083\), Osbourne (page 756\), and Aune (page 1164–1165\). For example:

> were fashioned out of (JBP)

> Each of the twelve foundations was a precious stone. (CEV)

**every kind of precious stone:** Each of the twelve foundation stones was a *precious stone*. The phrase *every kind* indicates that only precious stones were used. For example:

> the most precious stones

> very precious gemstones

#### 21:19b

**The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire,**

* The first foundation stone was a jasper, the second stone was a sapphire,
* The first foundation stone was made from/of a shiny, reddish/yellowish stone named jasper. The second foundation stone was made from/of a shiny, glassy/transparent blue stone named sapphire.

**The first foundation was jasper:** The BSB adds the word *was* to make the English natural. The first foundation stone was made of jasper. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> the first of the foundation\-stones being jasper (REB)

> The first foundation stone was made of jasper

> The first foundation was jasper stone

See how you translated the word *jasper* in 21:18\.

**the second sapphire:** The noun “foundation” and the verb “was” are implied but not repeated here. In some languages it is more natural to repeat some or all of the implied words. For example:

> the second foundation was a sapphire

> The second foundation was made of sapphire

**sapphire:** This name in Greek is spelled *sapfiros*. This word refers to a kind of blue stone that light shines through. One example of *sapphire* is:

In some languages people are not familiar with *sapphire*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > a shiny, glassy/transparent blue stone named sapphire

* Use the major language word for *sapphire*. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Sapphire is a kind of blue stone. Light shines through it.

**the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,**

* the third stone was a chalcedony/agate, the fourth stone was an emerald,
* The third foundation stone made from/of a shiny, tan/brown stone named chalcedony/agate. The forth foundation stone was made from/of a shiny, glassy/transparent green stone named emerald.

**chalcedony:** This name in Greek is spelled *chalkēdon*, where the “ch” is pronounced like a “k” without stopping the air in the mouth. This word probably refers to a kind of light tan stone with brown areas that shines brightly in the sun.Some scholars think this stone is a greenish stone found near the ancient town of Chalcedon. For example, the NJB says “turquoise.” But many scholars think it is the brownish stone now called “agate.” One example of *chalcedony* is:

Another English word for *chalcedony* is:

> agate (GNT)

Light reflects off the surface of this stone. Light does not shine through this stone like it does through glass.

In some languages people are not familiar with *chalcedony*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > a shiny, tan and brown stone named chalcedony

* Use the major language word for *chalcedony*. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Chalcedony is a kind of tan and brown stone. It shines brightly.

### Section 21:9–22:5: An angel showed the new Jerusalem to John

In this section, an angel showed the new Jerusalem to John. The angel again used a metaphor of a bride to describe new Jerusalem. The city was large and beautiful. God lived there with his people. His glory lighted the city. John described the city, the river that flowed through the city, and the tree that gave life. There were no bad things in the city at all.

Other examples for this section heading are:

> The vision of the new Jerusalem

> John saw/described the new Jerusalem as a bride for the Lamb

#### 21:20a

**the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian,**

* the fifth stone was a sardonyx, the sixth stone was a carnelian,
* The fifth foundation stone was made from/of a shiny, banded/striped red stone named sardonyx. The sixth foundation stone was made from/of a shiny, deep red stone named carnelian.

**sardonyx:** This name in Greek is spelled *sardonux*. This word refers to a kind of stone with red bands and lighter color bands. The lighter color bands can be white, tan, or pink. Light reflects off the surface of this stone. Light does not shine through this stone like it does through glass. One example of *sardonyx* is:

In some languages people are not familiar with *sardonyx*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > a shiny, banded/striped red stone named sardonyx

* Use the major language word for *sardonyx*. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Sardonyx is a kind of red stone with lighter colored bands. It shines brightly.

**carnelian:** This word refers to a kind of blood\-red stone that shines brightly in the sun. (The Greek word is *sardion*.) Light reflects off the surface of this stone. Light does not shine through this stone like it does through glass. See how you translated this word in 4:3\.

#### 21:20b

**the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl,**

* the seventh stone was a chrysolite/yellow\-quartz/yellow\-jasper, the eighth stone was a beryl,
* The seventh foundation stone was made from/of a shiny, yellow stone named chrysolite. The eighth foundation stone was made from/of a shiny, glassy/transparent, bluish\-green stone named beryl.

**chrysolite:** This name in Greek is spelled *chrusolithos*, where the “ch” is pronounced like a “k” without stopping the air in the mouth. This word probably refers to yellow jasper or yellow quartz. For example:

> goldstone (JBP)

Light reflects off the surface of yellow jasper, but it shines through yellow quartz.

In some languages people are not familiar with *chrysolite*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > a shiny, yellow stone named chrysolite

* Use the major language word for *chrysolite*. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Chrysolite is a kind of yellow stone. It shines brightly.

**beryl:** This name in Greek is spelled *berullos*. This word refers to a kind of bluish\-green or sea\-green stone that light shines through. One example of *beryl* is:

In some languages people are not familiar with *beryl*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > a shiny, glassy/transparent bluish\-green stone named beryl

* Use the major language word for *beryl*. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Beryl is a kind of bluish\-green stone. Light shines through it.

#### 21:20c

**the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase,**

* the ninth stone was a topaz, the tenth stone was a chrysoprase,
* The ninth foundation stone was made from/of a shiny, glassy/transparent yellow/greenish\-yellow stone named topaz. The tenth foundation stone was made from/of a shiny green stone named chrysoprase.

**topaz:** This name in Greek is spelled *topazion*. This word refers to a kind of yellowish\-brown or greenish\-yellow stone that light shines through.

In some languages people are not familiar with *topaz*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > a shiny, glassy/transparent yellow/greenish\-yellow stone named topaz

* Use the major language word for *topaz*. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Topaz is a kind of yellow or greenish\-yellow stone. Light shines through it.

**chrysoprase:** This name in Greek is spelled *chrusoprasos*, where the “ch” is pronounced like a “k” without stopping the air in the mouth. This word refers to a kind of green stone that shines brightly in the sun. Light reflects off the surface of this stone. Light does not shine through this stone like it does through glass.

In some languages people are not familiar with *chrysoprase*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

#### 21:20d

**the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst.**

* the eleventh stone was a jacinth, and the twelfth stone was an amethyst.
* The eleventh foundation stone was made from/of a shiny, dark blue stone named jacinth. The twelfth foundation stone was made from/of a shiny, glassy/transparent purple stone named amethyst.

**jacinth:** This name in Greek is spelled *uakinthos*. This Greek word refers to a kind of dark blue stone that shines brightly in the sun.It is probably a different stone from the current definition of the English word “jacinth.” Perhaps dark blue corundum is equivalent to the stone meant by the Greek word. Light reflects off the surface of this stone. Light does not shine through this stone like it does through glass. It may refer to the same color that is translated as “sapphire” in 9:17b.

In some languages people are not familiar with *jacinth*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > a shiny, dark blue stone named jacinth

* Use the major language word for *jacinth*. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Jacinth is the Greek word for a kind of dark blue stone. It shines brightly.

**amethyst:** This name in Greek is spelled *amethustos*. This word refers to a kind of purple stone that light shines through.

In some languages people are not familiar with *amethyst*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > a shiny, glassy/transparent purple stone named amethyst

* Use the major language word for *amethyst*. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

In this section, an angel showed the new Jerusalem to John. The angel again used a metaphor of a bride to describe new Jerusalem. The city was large and beautiful. God lived there with his people. His glory lighted the city. John described the city, the river that flowed through the city, and the tree that gave life. There were no bad things in the city at all.

#### 21:21a

**And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, with each gate consisting of a single pearl.**

* The twelve gates were twelve pearls. Each gate consisted of a single pearl.
* The material/substance of each of the twelve gates was one beautiful pearl.

**pearls:** The word *pearls* refer to hard, shiny spheres found in the shellfish called oysters. They are often grayish white in color, but sometimes dark gray. The good ones are very valuable. See how you translated this word in 17:4 or 18:12\.

**with each gate consisting of a single pearl:** The Greek clause is literally “each gate was of one pearl.” In English it is more natural to use a passive clause with the verb “make.” The topic is the *gate*. The topic is not who made it. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> each gate was made of one pearl

> The material/substance of each gate was a single pearl

#### 21:21b

**The main street of the city was pure gold, as clear as glass.**

* The main street of the city consisted of pure gold, gleaming like glass.
* The material/substance of the city’s main street was pure gold. It was as bright as clear glass.

**The main street of the city was pure gold:** The focus here is on the *street* and the *gold* used to make it. The focus is not on who made it or on the fact that it was made. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> The main street consisted of pure gold

> The material/substance of the main street was pure gold

**The main street:** The Greek phrase is literally “the street.” The BSB and other English versions interpret this phrase as referring to the main street of the city. For example:

> the great street (NIV)

**as clear as glass:** It is not clear as to how the gold is *as clear as glass*. The Greek word that the BSB translates as *clear* occurs only here in the New Testament. It occurs only once in the Greek translation of the Old Testament, where it means “pure.”Proverbs 16:2 “All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes” (RSV). The Hebrew word means “clean, pure.” Many English versions translate as the BSB does. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> gleaming like glass (JBP)

> bright as clear glass

> like transparent glass (NIV)

### Section 21:9–22:5: An angel showed the new Jerusalem to John

In this section, an angel showed the new Jerusalem to John. The angel again used a metaphor of a bride to describe new Jerusalem. The city was large and beautiful. God lived there with his people. His glory lighted the city. John described the city, the river that flowed through the city, and the tree that gave life. There were no bad things in the city at all.

Other examples for this section heading are:

> The vision of the new Jerusalem

> John saw/described the new Jerusalem as a bride for the Lamb

#### 21:22a

**But I saw no temple in the city,**

* ¶ I saw no temple in the city,
* ¶ I did not see a temple anywhere in the city,

**But I saw no temple in the city:** This sentence indicates that no temple existed in the city. Your translation should not imply that there was a temple hidden somewhere so that John did not see it. For example:

> There was no temple anywhere in the city

> Nowhere in the city did I see a temple

**temple:** The word *temple* refers to a building where God, or another deity, is believed to be present in a special way. People worship there. See how you translated this word in 3:12 or 16:17\.

#### 21:22b

**because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.**

* because its temple is the Lord God All\-Powerful and the Lamb.
* because the Lord God, the one who has all power, and the Lamb are always in the city as its temple.
* because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are there, and everyone worships them in their presence.

**because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple:** Here the word *temple* refers figuratively to a place where people worship God. God and Jesus will live in the city and the people can worship them at any time and any place in the city. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb were themselves the temple (NJB)

> the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are present in the city as its temple

> the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are there and everyone worships in their presence

**Lord:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Lord* means “the one who has authority over (something),” or “owner.” God has authority over everyone. See how you translated this word in 4:8 or 19:6\.

**Almighty:** This word is a title which means, “ the one with the power to do anything.” For example:

> the All\-Powerful (NET)

See how you translated this word in 1:8 or 19:6\.

**the Lamb:** This is a title for Jesus. Jewish people killed a lamb at the Passover as a sacrifice to God. The lamb has symbolic meaning as a special sacrifice and is a symbol for the Christ. See how you translated this title in 21:9\.

### Section 21:9–22:5: An angel showed the new Jerusalem to John

In this section, an angel showed the new Jerusalem to John. The angel again used a metaphor of a bride to describe new Jerusalem. The city was large and beautiful. God lived there with his people. His glory lighted the city. John described the city, the river that flowed through the city, and the tree that gave life. There were no bad things in the city at all.

Other examples for this section heading are:

> The vision of the new Jerusalem

> John saw/described the new Jerusalem as a bride for the Lamb

#### 21:23a

**And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it,**

* The city has no need of the light from the sun or moon,
* There is no need for the sun or moon to light the city,

**And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it:** The glory of God shines upon the city, so the city needs no other lights. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> The city has no need of the sun or the moon to shine on it (GNT)

> There is no need for the sun or moon to shine on the city

#### 21:23b

**because the glory of God illuminates the city, and the Lamb is its lamp.**

* because the glory/splendor of God lights it, and the Lamb is a lamp for it.
* because glory/radiance of God lights it, and the Lamb is like its lamp.

**because:** This conjunction introduces the reason for there being no need for the light of the sun or moon in the city.

**the glory of God illuminates the city:** The word *glory* refers to splendor and majesty. Here the word implies brightness. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> the glory of God shines on it (GNT)

> it was lit by the radiant glory of God (NJB)

**the Lamb is its lamp:** This metaphor indicates that the *Lamb* is like a *lamp* for the city. The metaphor probably refers figuratively to the Lamb showing God’s glory in the new Jerusalem.

In some languages a literal translation would not indicate the figurative meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

##### **General Comment on 21:23a–b**

* Change the metaphor to a simile. For example:

    > the Lamb is like its lamp

* Explain its meaning in your translation. For example:

    > the Lamb shows God’s glory like a lamp

* Translate the literal meaning of the metaphor and explain its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > This metaphor indicates that the Lamb shows God’s glory, like a lamp gives light.

The reason (21:23b) occurs after the result (21:23a). In some languages the reason must come first. For example:

> 23bThe glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp, so 23athe city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it.

#### 21:24a

**By its light the nations will walk,**

* The nations will walk/live by the light from/of the city,

**By its light the nations will walk:** There is a textual issue in 21:24a: (1\) Early Greek manuscripts have the word nations (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some later Greek manuscripts have the words nations of the ones being saved (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. This clause indicates that all the peoples of the world will live in the light that comes from the city. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> By its light the people of the world will walk (NCV)

> Nations will walk by the light of that city (CEV)

**walk:** This word refers figuratively to how people live. The nations will follow the ways of the people of the city.

#### 21:24b

**and into it the kings of the earth will bring their glory.**

* and the kings of the earth will bring their majesty into it.
* and the kings of the world will enter the city in all their grandeur.

**into it the kings of the earth will bring their glory:** There is a textual issue in 21:24b: (1\) Early Greek manuscripts have the word glory (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some later Greek manuscripts have the words glory and honor. It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB literally translates as *glory*:

1. It means glory, splendor, or majesty. For example:

    > the kings of the earth will bring their grandeur into it (NET) *(BSB, RSV, NIV, NASB, NLT, GW, NET, REB, NCV, ESV, KJV)*

2. It means wealth. For example:

    > kings will bring their riches there (CEV) *(GNT, NJB, NABRE, CEV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).This verse is similar to Isaiah 60:5, which says “riches of the nations.” But John was not trying to copy that verse exactly. He probably used “glory” to refer to praise, honor, and beautiful things as well as wealth. Beale (page 1095\) says, “‘glory’ in the form of praise.” Aune (page 1136\), Osbourne (page 747\), Kistemaker (page 573\), Lenski (page 642\), and Beckwith (page 763\) have “glory” in their translations.

Here the word *glory* refers to the kings honoring the city by bringing to it their own splendor or majesty. Another way to translate this clause is:

> to it the kings of the earth shall bring their splendour (REB)

**the kings of the earth:** This phrase refers to the leaders of the nations (21:24a).

**glory:** See how you translated the word “glory” in 21:11a.

**Its gates will never be shut at the end of the day,**

* Its gates will never be closed in the evening,
* Its gates will always be open,

#### 21:25a–b

**Its gates will never be shut at the end of the day, because there will be no night there:** Here the Greek word that the BSB translates as *day* refers to the hours of daylight. There will be no night, so the gates of the city wall will always be open. Other ways to translate these words are:

> In the daytime (for there will be no night there) its gates will never be closed (NASB)

> The gates of the city will stand open all day; they will never be closed, because there will be no night there (GNT)

#### 21:25b

**because there will be no night there.**

* for there will be no night in the city.
* because night will not exist there.

**And into the city will be brought the glory and honor of the nations.**

* The glory/splendor and the honor/reverence of the nations will be brought into it.
* And all the nations will bring their glory and honor into the city. (NLT)

**And into the city will be brought:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *will be brought* is literally “(they) will bring.” Although the BSB translates this word as a passive clause, it is active in the Greek. The implied pronoun “they” may refer to:

1. the kings of the earth (21:24b);
2. the nations (21:24a);
3. people in general.

Some ways to translate it are:

* Use a passive clause, as the BSB does. For example:

    > shall be brought into it (REB)

* Use an active clause with a general subject. For example:

    > they shall bring into it (RSV)

* Use an active clause and refer to the nations. For example:

    > all the nations will bring (NLT)

**the glory and honor of the nations:** There are several ways to interpret the Greek words that the BSB translates as *glory and honor*:

1. The words glory and honor have their usual meanings here. For example:

    > the nations’ grandeur and honor *(BSB, RSV, NIV, NASB, NLT, NCV, ESV, KJV)*

2. The word glory has its usual meaning, but the word honor refers to wealth here. For example:

    > The greatness and the wealth of the nations (GNT) *(GNT, GW, CEV, NET, REB)*

3. The words glory and honor refer to treasure and wealth here. For example:

    > their treasure and their wealth (NJB) *(NJB, NABRE)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).This is the same issue as in 21:24b regarding “glory.” Beale (page 1095\) connects this word here to the same word in 21:24\. Aune (page 1136\), Osbourne (page 747\), Kistemaker (page 573\), Lenski (page 642\), and Beckwith (page 763\) have “glory” in their translations. But you should follow the same interpretation that you used in 21:24b.

**glory:** Here this Greek word means “splendor,” or “majesty.” See how you translated this word in 21:24\.

**honor:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *honor* means “respect, reverence.” See how you translated this word in 5:12 or 7:12\.

#### 21:27a

**But nothing unclean will ever enter it,**

* Nothing profane/unholy will ever enter it,
* No unworthy/evil thing or person will ever enter the city.

**But nothing unclean will ever enter it:** The Greek clause is literally “Every profane (thing) shall never enter it.” This clause refers to things as well as people. Translate this clause so that it includes people. For example:

> Nothing or no one impure will ever enter it

> No impure thing or person will ever enter it

**unclean:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *unclean* is literally “common” or “ordinary.” Here the word is used as an opposite to “holy.” So it means “anything that God says is bad.” Other ways to translate this word are:

> unworthy (CEV)

> not holy

> against God

#### 21:27b

**nor anyone who practices an abomination or a lie,**

* and no detestable person or liar either,
* Also no person who does obscene things or lies/deceives will ever enter it.

**nor anyone who practices an abomination or a lie:** The phrase “will ever enter it” is implied from 21:27a but not repeated here. In some languages it is more natural to include some or all of the implied words. For example:

> nor will anyone who practices an abomination or a lie ever enter it

**anyone who practices an abomination:** The Greek phrase is literally “the (one) doing abomination.” This phrase refers to people who do things that God considers detestable or very awful. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> anyone who does what is shameful (NIV)

> anyone who does obscene things

> anyone who does what is detestable (NET)

**a lie:** This word refers to a person who tells lies as a way of life.

#### 21:27c

**but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s Book of Life.**

* but only the people whose names are in the Lamb’s Book of Life.
* The only people who will enter are those whose names are in the Lamb’s book of the people to whom God will give eternal life.

**but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s Book of Life:** This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active or intransitive clause. Jesus probably wrote the book, since it is his. For example:

> only those whose names the Lamb had written in his Book of Life

> only those whose names were in the Lamb’s Book of Life

If you translate according to the last example, your translation should imply that the names were written.

**the Lamb’s Book of Life:** This phrase refers to a *Book* that has in it the names of people to whom God will give eternal *Life*. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the Lamb’s Book in which is the names of those who have eternal life

> the Lamb’s Book with/having the names of those to whom God will give eternal life

See how you translated the phrase “the Book of Life” in 3:5 or 20:12\.

**Then the angel showed me a river of the water of life, as clear as crystal,**

* ¶ Then the angel showed to me the river of life\-giving water, which was bright like crystal,
* ¶ Then the angel showed to me the sparkling river whose water gives life.

**the angel:** This is the same angel as in 21:9–17\.

**showed me a river of the water of life:** There is a textual issue in 22:1a: (1\) Early Greek manuscripts have the word river (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some later Greek manuscripts have the words pure river (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. This clause indicates that the water in the river was the water of life. For example:

> showed me a river filled with the water of life (GW)

**the water of life:** This phrase indicates that the water is a source of eternal life. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> water that gives eternal life

> life\-giving water

See how you translated this phrase in 7:17 (“living water”) or 21:6\.

**as clear as crystal:** There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as *clear*:

1. The word means bright or sparkling here. For example:

    > sparkling like crystal (GNT) *(RSV, GNT, NABRE, REB, NCV, ESV)*

2. The word means clear here. For example:

    > crystal–clear (NJB) *(BSB, NIV, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because that is the usual meaning of the Greek word.Beale (page 1104\), Osbourne (page 768\), and Lenski (page 648\) translate it as “bright.” Aune (page 1136\) and Kistemaker (page 579\) translate it as “sparkling.”

**crystal:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *crystal* refers to various substances that are bright, shiny, and have flat surfaces. (See drawing at 4:6\.) The Greek word probably refers only to crystals that let light shine through them. Quartz, diamond, and sapphire are examples of crystals. Here the focus is on the fact that the *crystal* is shiny.

In some languages people are not familiar with *crystal*. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Use the characteristics of crystals that are important here. For example:

    > bright and sparkling

* Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, you may want to explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Crystals are hard substances that are see\-through, shiny, and have flat surfaces. The water in this verse is shiny and sparkling like crystal.

See how you translated this word in 4:6 or 21:11\.

* flowing/coming from the throne belonging to God and the Lamb
* It flowed/poured from the place/seat of ruling where God and the Lamb sat/ruled.

**flowing from:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *flowing from* is literally “coming out of.” The phrase indicates that the river came out of the throne. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> coming from (GNT)

> pouring out from (NET)

**the throne of God and of the Lamb:** The throne belongs to both God and the Lamb. It is where God and the Lamb rule.

## Revelation 22:2 (id: 523383)

### Section 21:9–22:5: An angel showed the new Jerusalem to John

In this section, an angel showed the new Jerusalem to John. The angel again used a metaphor of a bride to describe new Jerusalem. The city was large and beautiful. God lived there with his people. His glory lighted the city. John described the city, the river that flowed through the city, and the tree that gave life. There were no bad things in the city at all.

Other examples for this section heading are:

> The vision of the new Jerusalem

> John saw/described the new Jerusalem as a bride for the Lamb

#### 22:2a

**down the middle of the main street of the city.**

* down the middle of the city’s main street.
* It flowed/went down the middle of the main street of the city.

**down the middle of the main street of the city:** The river splits this street down its length into two parts.

#### 22:2b

**On either side of the river stood a tree of life,**

* On either side of the river the tree of life stood,
* The tree that gives eternal life was on one side of the river and another one on the other side.

**On either side of the river stood a tree of life:** The Greek words are literally “on this (side) and on that (side) of the river (a/the) tree of life.” There are several ways to interpret the Greek words:

1. It refers to one tree that spans the river. For example, the RSV says:

    > on either side of the river, the tree of life *(RSV, NIV, GNT, ESV, NASB, KJV, NABRE, ESV, NET, NCV)*

2. It refers to two trees, one on each side of the river. For example, the NLT says:

    > On each side of the river grew a tree of life (NLT) *(BSB, NLT, REB)*

3. It refers to more than one tree on each side of the river. For example, the NJB says:

    > on either bank of the river were the trees of life *(NJB, CEV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because the Greek word for *tree* is singular.Lenski and Hughes support interpretation (1\). Aune, Beale, Osbourne, Kistemaker, Smalley, Swete, Beckwith, and Charles support interpretation (3\), usually looking to Ezekiel 47:12 and calling the singular Greek word that means “tree” a collective noun, which implies “trees” here.

**a tree of life:** This phrase indicates that this *tree* is a source of *life*. Those who eat the fruit will have eternal life. For example:

> life\-giving tree

See how you translated this phrase in 2:7\.

#### 22:2c

**bearing twelve kinds of fruit and yielding a fresh crop for each month.**

* producing twelve different crops of fruit, one crop each month.
* The trees produce a different kind of fruit each month of the year.

**bearing twelve kinds of fruit and yielding a fresh crop for each month:** The Greek words are literally “producing twelve fruits according to each month yielding its fruit.” Here the Greek phrase “twelve fruits” refers to twelve crops of fruit. There are two ways to interpret this clause:

1. The tree produces a different kind of fruit each month. For example:

    > with its twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month (RSV) *(BSB, RSV, NASB, GW, CEV, NET, ESV, KJV)*

2. The tree produces the same fruit each month. For example:

    > which bears fruit twelve times a year, once each month (GNT) *(NIV, GNT, NJB, NABRE, NLT, REB, NCV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because of the phrase “according to each month” in the Greek probably indicates twelve kinds of fruit.Aune (page 1178\) says “twelve *different* kinds of fruit” and Smalley (page 527\) says “twelve types of fruit.”

#### 22:2d

**And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.**

* The leaves of the trees have the ability to heal the nations.
* The leaves of the trees are like medicine that will make the nations healthy/well.

**And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations:** The leaves have the ability to heal all the peoples of the world. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> The leaves were used for medicine to heal the nations (NLT)

> The leaves of the tree will heal the nations (GW)

* **Associated Passages:** REV 22:2

### Section 21:9–22:5: An angel showed the new Jerusalem to John

In this section, an angel showed the new Jerusalem to John. The angel again used a metaphor of a bride to describe new Jerusalem. The city was large and beautiful. God lived there with his people. His glory lighted the city. John described the city, the river that flowed through the city, and the tree that gave life. There were no bad things in the city at all.

Other examples for this section heading are:

> The vision of the new Jerusalem

> John saw/described the new Jerusalem as a bride for the Lamb

#### 22:3a

**No longer will there be any curse.**

* No curse will exist any more.
* No longer will any curse be in effect.

**No longer will there be any curse:** The Greek clause is literally “every curse will no longer be/exist.” There are two ways to interpret this clause:

1. This clause indicates that all promises of destruction are gone. For example:

    > There will no longer be any curse (NASB) *(BSB, NIV, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, KJV)*

2. This clause indicates that all people and things that God has promised to destroy are gone. For example:

    > Nothing that is under God’s curse will be found in the city (GNT) *(RSV, GNT, NABRE, REB, ESV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because the focus of the clause is on the curse and not on who or what is cursed.Beale (page 1112\) says “any curse…The phrase is from Zech. 14:11…‘a curse’.” Smalley (page 527\) translates the Greek word *katathema* as “The curse of destruction.” Beckwith (page 766\) says, “there will no more be a curse of God.”

**curse:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *curse* means “promising to completely destroy something.” Other ways to translate this word are:

> promise to destroy

> curse of destruction (NJB)

#### 22:3b

**The throne of God and of the Lamb will be within the city,**

* ¶ The throne that belongs to God and the Lamb will be in the city,
* ¶ The place/seat of ruling where God and the Lamb sit/rule will be in the city,

**the city:** The Greek word here is “her.” In Greek “street” (22:2a) is also feminine, but *city* (21:23a) makes more sense here.

#### 22:3c

**and His servants will worship Him.**

* and his servants/slaves will serve him.
* and those who serve him/God will do his will.
* and the people serving him/God will do what he commands them to do.

**His servants:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *servants* can also be translated as “slaves.” Here the phrase refers to believers serving God. The difference between “slave” and “servant” is not important here. See how you translated the word *servants* in 2:20 or 19:2\.

**worship:** Here the word *worship* refers to doing religious duties. These duties include worship and doing the work of a priest. Other ways to translate this word are:

> do his will

> do everything that he commands them to do

See how you translated this word in 7:15, where the BSB translates it as “serve.”

**Him:** This pronoun probably refers to God here.

### Section 21:9–22:5: An angel showed the new Jerusalem to John

In this section, an angel showed the new Jerusalem to John. The angel again used a metaphor of a bride to describe new Jerusalem. The city was large and beautiful. God lived there with his people. His glory lighted the city. John described the city, the river that flowed through the city, and the tree that gave life. There were no bad things in the city at all.

Other examples for this section heading are:

> The vision of the new Jerusalem

> John saw/described the new Jerusalem as a bride for the Lamb

#### 22:4

**They will see His face, and His name will be on their foreheads.**

* They will see his/God’s face, and his name will be on their foreheads.
* They will see him. His name will be on their foreheads to show that they belong to him.

**They will see His face:** No human has seen God’s face (Exodus 33:20, 1 Timothy 6:16\). But God will make his people (“servants,” 22:3c) holy, so that they can come to him and see his face. This clause implies that they can speak personally with God. For example:

> they will see him face to face (NJB)

**His:** This pronoun probably refers to God here.

**His name will be on their foreheads:** This clause indicates that the people belong to God and have a relationship with him.

In some languages people will think the *name* on *their foreheads* has another purpose. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the correct meaning in your translation. For example:

    > his name will be on their foreheads to show that they belong to him

* Explain the correct meaning in a footnote. For example:

    > The name on their foreheads indicates that the people belong to God and have a relationship with him.

#### 22:5a

**There will be no more night in the city,**

* Night/Darkness will no longer exist,
* There will never be night again. (NCV)

**There will be no more night in the city:** The Greek clause is literally “night will no longer be/exist.” This clause indicates that there will no longer be times of darkness. For example:

> Night will be no more (NET)

#### 22:5b

**and they will have no need for the light of a lamp or of the sun.**

* and they will have no need for the light of a lamp or the sun,
* The people will not need light from a lamp or the sun,

**they will have no need for the light of a lamp or of the sun:** God will cause the whole city to always be lit. It will probably be brightly lit, like the sun lights a city. So the people of the city will not need lamps or sunlight in order to see. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> they will not need lamps or sunlight (GNT)

> no one who lives there will ever need a lamp or the sun (CEV)

#### 22:5c

**For the Lord God will shine on them,**

* for the Lord God will be their light, (RSV)
* because the Lord God will shine on them.

**For:** This conjunction introduces the reason why the people have no need for a lamp or the sun.

**the Lord God:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Lord* means “the one who has authority over (something),” or “owner.” God has authority over everyone. See how you translated this word in 21:22\.

**will shine on them:** The Greek words are literally “will shine on them” (as in the NLT). The glory of God will light the city (21:23b). Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> will illumine them (NASB)

> will be their light (RSV)

#### 22:5d

**and they will reign forever and ever.**

* and they will rule as kings/leaders forever.
* And they will rule eternally.

**reign:** This word refers to ruling people as king. For example:

> rule as kings (GNT)

**forever and ever:** The Greek phrase is literally “into the ages of the ages.” The word “age” refers to a very long time, so the phrase “the ages of the ages” refers to eternity. For example:

> for timeless ages (JBP)

### Section 22:6–21: Conclusion

This is the last division of the book of Revelation and the last section. In it, the angel, Jesus, John, and the Holy Spirit spoke some final messages.

The angel of 21:9–22:5 affirmed that the book of Revelation is true. Then Jesus reminded the readers that he will return to earth. He also encouraged the readers to believe what was in this book. Then the angel told John to make this message known to other believers.

Then Jesus again spoke words of encouragement to believers. The Holy Spirit and the church invited all people to come to Jesus and believe in him. Then John warned everyone not to add any words to this book or remove any part of it. Jesus again reminded the readers that he will return. John agreed and ended the book with a blessing on God’s people.

Other examples of headings are:

> Ending messages/announcements to endorse/approve the book

> Final words to encourage the readers

> Jesus, the angel, the Holy Spirit, and John conclude the book

#### 22:6a

**Then the angel said to me, “These words are faithful and true.**

* ¶ The angel said to me, “These/those words are reliable and true.
* ¶ Then the angel told me, “All those words can be trusted, and they are true.

**Then the angel:** This is the same angel as in 21:9a and 22:1a.

**These words:** This phrase refers to everything revealed to John. For example:

> Everything you have heard (NLT)

**faithful:** This word refers to something that someone can depend on. What God said will certainly happen. Other ways to translate this word are:

> reliable (NET)

> can be trusted (GNT)

See how you translated this word in 21:5\.

#### 22:6b

**The Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent His angel**

* The Lord, namely the God of the spirits/souls of the prophets, sent his angel
* The Lord God inspires the prophets, and he sent his angel

**The Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets:** There is a textual issue in 22:6b: (1\) Early Greek manuscripts have the text the spirits of the prophets (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) A few later Greek manuscripts have the text the holy prophets (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. The phrase *the God of the spirits of the prophets* describes the phrase *The Lord*. For example:

> the Lord God who inspires the prophets (NJB)

> God the Lord speaks to the spirits of his prophets, and

**the God of the spirits of the prophets:** There are two ways to interpret the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *the God of*:

1. It indicates that God has a relationship with the spirits of the prophets. He gives messages to the prophets. For example:

    > God, who inspires his prophets (NLT) *(BSB, RSV, NIV, NJB, NASB, NABRE, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, REB, NCV, ESV)*

2. It indicates that God gives the Holy Spirit to the prophets. For example:

    > God, who gives his Spirit to the prophets (GNT) *(GNT)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because the Greek word for *spirits* is plural, so it probably refers to the spirits of the prophets.Aune (page 1182\) supports interpretation (1\), noting the plural “spirits.” Beale (page 1125\) says, “it would seem strange to refer to the Holy Spirit in the plural here.” Other ways to translate this phrase according to interpretation (1\) are:

> the God who speaks to the spirits of the prophets

> the God who is connected to the spirits of the prophets

**prophets:** The *prophets* are people to whom God gives a message. The message (often called a “prophecy”) may include a vision, as in Ezekiel 1 and Daniel 8\. The message, called a prophecy, may reveal something about past events, current events, or future events. The prophet speaks God’s message to the people or writes it down for their use. See how you translated this word in 10:7 or 18:20\.

**His angel:** This phrase may refer to the angel of 1:1 or it may refer to the angel of 4:1\. You should translate this phrase without describing to which angel this phrase refers.

#### 22:6c

**to show His servants what must soon take place.”**

* to show to his servants/slaves the things which must occur/happen soon.”
* to reveal to those who serve him what he has decided will soon happen.”

**His servants:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *servants* can also be translated as “slaves.” Here the phrase refers to believers serving God. The difference between “slaves” and “servants” is not important here. See how you translated the word *servants* in 22:3\.

**what must soon take place:** This phrase refers to all the events that are revealed in this book. For example:

> what must happen very soon (GNT)

See how you translated a similar phrase in 1:1 (“what must soon come to pass”).

**must:** Here the word *must* indicates that the events are required to happen. God has decided that these events will happen, and he will not change his mind. Other ways to translate this word are:

> will necessarily

> has been determined to

**take place:** The words *take place* mean “happen” (as in the GNT).

#### 22:7a–b

**“Behold, I am coming soon. Blessed is the one who keeps the words of prophecy in this book.”:** The Greek does not say who spoke these words. There are several interpretations:

1. Jesus spoke the words in 22:7a–b. For example:

    > “Listen!” says Jesus. “I am coming soon! Happy are those who obey the prophetic words in this book!” (GNT) *(BSB, NIV, GNT, NASB, NLT, NET, NCV, ESV)*

2. The angel also spoke the words in 22:7a and John wrote the words in 22:7b. For example:

    > 6c to show his servants what must soon take place. 7aAnd behold, I am coming soon.” 7b Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book. (RSV) *(RSV, NJB, REB)*

3. The angel also spoke the words in 22:7a–b. For example:

    > 6c to show his servants the things that must happen soon. 7a I’m coming soon! 7b Blessed is the one who follows the words of the prophecy in this book.” (GW) *(GW)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).Aune (page 1184\) supports interpretation (1\). Osbourne (page 782\) says “Christ speaks directly for the second time (cf. 16:15\).” Kistemaker (page 585\) says “the first person singular pronoun *I* points to Jesus.”

The Greek and the BSB do not introduce the new speaker. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that the angel spoke these words. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Indicate who spoke in your translation. For example:

    > Jesus said, “Behold, I am coming soon! Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy in this book.”

* Explain who spoke in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Jesus probably said this.

#### 22:7a

**“Behold, I am coming soon.**

* ¶ “Look/Listen,(plur) I am coming quickly!
* ¶ Jesus said, “Indeed/Hey, I will come without delay!

**Behold:** This word means “look.” The word emphasizes or calls attention to the words that follow. It is not a command to look at something. Other ways to translate this word are:

> Look (NLT)

> Listen (GNT)

> Indeed/Hey

**I am coming soon:** This clause refers to Jesus returning to his people on earth. The Greek word that the BSB translates as *soon* can also mean “without delay” or “quickly.” Other ways to translate this clause are:

> I am coming quickly (NASB)

> I am coming without delay

See how you translated this clause in 3:11\.

#### 22:7b

**Blessed is the one who keeps the words of prophecy in this book.”**

* Favored is he who values/obeys the words/message of the prophecy in this book.”
* In a good position in God’s eyes are those who follow the prophecies in this book.”

**Blessed:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Blessed* describes a person who is in a good situation. In the Bible, the good situation results from God showing favor/kindness to the person. Other ways to translate this word are:

> Favored

> How good it is

> In a good/desirable position in God’s eyes

> Shown kindness by God

See how you translated this word in 1:3 or 20:6\.

**keeps the words of prophecy in this book:** Here, the word *keeps* refers to following what was said and valuing it. Believers follow the words of this book and value it. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> values the words of the prophecy in this book

> obey the prophetic words in this book (GNT)

**prophecy:** The word *prophecy* refers to a message that God gives to someone. The message may include a vision, as in Ezekiel 1 and Daniel 8\. A *prophecy* may reveal something about past events, current events, or future events. The prophet speaks the *prophecy* to the people or writes it for their use.

See how you translated this word in 1:3 or 19:10\.

**And I am John, who heard and saw these things.**

* ¶ I, John, heard and saw those things.
* ¶ I am John, it was I who heard and saw all those things.

#### 22:8b

**And when I had heard and seen them,**

* After I had heard and seen them,
* When I had heard and seen those things,

#### 22:8a–b

**I am John, who heard and saw these things:** John referred to himself by name here in order to make it clear that he spoke for himself. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> I, John, have heard and seen all these things (GNT)

> I am John, I myself heard and saw those things

**I am John:** The pronoun *I* is emphasized in the Greek.

**these things:** This phrase refers to all that John had just seen about the new Jerusalem. However, it can also refer to all the visions that he saw in this book.

#### 22:8c

**I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel**

* I prostrated myself at the angel’s feet to worship/honor him,
* I knelt and put my face to the ground with arms outstretched before the angel to revere him.

**I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel:** Here the phrase *fell down* refers to kneeling and putting the face to the ground with arms outstretched toward someone. This position showed complete humility before that person and honored him. The word *fell* implies a quick and complete action. It does not refer to accidentally falling. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> I prostrated myself before him

> I threw myself down to worship at the feet of the angel (NET)

> I knelt at the feet of the angel who had shown them to me, to worship him (NJB)

See how you translated a similar clause (“I fell at his feet to worship him”) in 19:10\.

**worship:** This word refers to honoring someone or something as sacred/divine. Other ways to translate this word are:

> venerate

> revere

See how you translated this word in 13:4 or 19:10\.

In some languages it is helpful to make it clear that John was about to worship the angel. For example:

> and I was about to worship him (GNT)

#### 22:8d

**who had shown me these things.**

* because he had showed them to me.
* He had showed those things to me.

**who had shown me these things:** This clause tells the reader more about the angel. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there were other angels in front of John and only this one *had shown* the visions to John. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about the angel. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> He had showed them to me.

**Do not do that!:** The angel commanded John not to worship him. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> You must not do that! (RSV)

> Do not worship me!

See how you translated this clause in 19:10\.

#### 22:9b

**I am a fellow servant with you**

* I am a coworker of yours(sing)
* I serve God just as you do

**I am a fellow servant with you:** This clause indicates that the angel served God just as John served God. They both did what God told them to do. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> I am a servant together with you (GNT)

> I serve God just as you serve him

See how you translated this clause in 19:10\.

* Worship only God!”
* It is God you should worship!”

#### 22:9c–e

**your brothers the prophets:** The phrase *the prophets* indicates that the angel was referring to believers who were *prophets*. They are John’s *brothers* because both they and John believe in Jesus. The word *brothers* refers to both men and women here. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> your brother and sister prophets

> your fellow believers who are prophets

**“Do not seal up the words of prophecy in this book,**

* “Do not lock away/up the words/messages of the prophecy in this book,
* “Do not prevent others from knowing the prophecies of this book,

#### 22:10a–b

**Do not seal up the words of prophecy in this book:** The phrase *seal up* refers to putting a seal on something. Here a seal would prevent others from reading the book. The angel wanted John to let others know what was in the book. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> do not prevent others from knowing the words of the prophecy of this book

> Share the words of the prophecy of this book, do not hide them

> Do not keep secret the words of prophecy in this book (NCV)

See how you translated the word “sealed” in 5:1\.

**the words of prophecy in this book:** This phrase indicates that this *book* contained *the words of prophecy* to which the angel referred. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the prophetic words in this book (NLT)

> the words of the prophecy of this scroll (NIV11\)

See how you translated this phrase in 22:7\.

#### 22:10c

**because the time is near.**

### Section 22:6–21: Conclusion

This is the last division of the book of Revelation and the last section. In it, the angel, Jesus, John, and the Holy Spirit spoke some final messages.

The angel of 21:9–22:5 affirmed that the book of Revelation is true. Then Jesus reminded the readers that he will return to earth. He also encouraged the readers to believe what was in this book. Then the angel told John to make this message known to other believers.

Then Jesus again spoke words of encouragement to believers. The Holy Spirit and the church invited all people to come to Jesus and believe in him. Then John warned everyone not to add any words to this book or remove any part of it. Jesus again reminded the readers that he will return. John agreed and ended the book with a blessing on God’s people.

Other examples of headings are:

#### 22:11a

**Let the unrighteous continue to be unrighteous,**

* May whoever is evil do evil still,
* Those who do what is wrong/evil, let them continue doing so!

**Let the unrighteous continue to be unrighteous:** This command is to everyone who is a wrongdoer. In some languages using plural forms is more natural. For example:

> Those who do what is wrong/evil, continue doing what is wrong/evil!

**the unrighteous:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *the unrighteous* refers to someone who does things that God says are not right to do. For example:

> the one who is doing harm (NLT)

> whoever is doing evil (NCV)

> He that is unjust (KJV)

#### 22:11b

**and the vile continue to be vile;**

* may whoever is immoral do immoral things still,
* Those who do what is morally bad, continue doing so!

**the vile continue to be vile:** This command is to everyone who is *vile*. Translate this clause in a similar way to 22:11\. For example:

> Those who are vile continue being vile!

**vile:** Here the Greek word that the BSB translates as *vile* refers to deeds that are morally bad or wrong. Other ways to translate this word are:

> morally filthy (NET)

> impure mind

> immoral

> dirty\-minded (CEV)

#### 22:11c

**let the righteous continue to practice righteousness,**

* and may whoever does right/just deeds do right/just deeds still,
* Those who do what is upright, continue doing so!

**let the righteous continue to practice righteousness:** The phrase *the righteous* indicates that the deeds of these people are upright and good in God’s eyes. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> let the good persevere in their goodness (REB)

> The one who is righteous must continue to act righteously (NET)

#### 22:11d

**and the holy continue to be holy.”**

* and may whoever is holy be holy still.”
* And those who are devoted to serving God, continue being so!”

**holy:** Here the word *holy* refers to being set apart for special service to God. Here it probably also implies being without sin. Other ways to translate this word are:

> devoted to God

> set apart for God

> pure/blemishless/sinless

## Revelation 22:12 (id: 523402)

### Section 22:6–21: Conclusion

This is the last division of the book of Revelation and the last section. In it, the angel, Jesus, John, and the Holy Spirit spoke some final messages.

The angel of 21:9–22:5 affirmed that the book of Revelation is true. Then Jesus reminded the readers that he will return to earth. He also encouraged the readers to believe what was in this book. Then the angel told John to make this message known to other believers.

Then Jesus again spoke words of encouragement to believers. The Holy Spirit and the church invited all people to come to Jesus and believe in him.

John agreed and ended the book with a blessing on God’s people.

Other examples of headings are:

> Ending messages/announcements to endorse/approve the book

> Final words to encourage the readers

> Jesus, the angel, the Holy Spirit, and John conclude the book

#### 22:12–16

There are several ways to interpret who spoke these verses:

1. 22:12–16 are the words of Jesus. For example, the GW says:

    > 12 “I’m coming soon! I will bring my reward with me to pay all people based on what they have done. 13 I am the A and the Z, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.

    > 14 “Blessed are those who wash their robes so that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city. 15 Outside are dogs, sorcerers, sexual sinners, murderers, idolaters, and all who lie in what they say and what they do.

    > 16 “I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give this testimony to you for the churches. I am the root and descendant of David. I am the bright morning star.” *(NIV, GW, CEV, NCV)*

2. 22:12,13 are the words of someone, probably Jesus; 22:14,15 are the words of John; and 22:16 are the words of Jesus. For example, the ESV says:

    > 12 “Behold, I am coming soon, bringing my recompense with me, to repay everyone for what he has done. 13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.”

    > 14 Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the tree of life and that they may enter the city by the gates. 15 Outside are the dogs and sorcerers and the sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.

    > 16 “I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify to you about these things for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star.” *(BSB, RSV, GNT, NASB, NABRE, ESV, NLT, NET, REB)*

3. 22:12–15 are the words of the angel, and 22:16 are the words of Jesus. For example, the NJB says:

    > …holy. 12 Look, I am coming soon, and my reward is with me, to repay everyone as their deeds deserve. 13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End. 14 Blessed are those who will have washed their robes clean, so that they will have the right to feed on the tree of life and can come through the gates into the city. 15 Others must stay outside: dogs, fortune–tellers, and the sexually immoral, murderers, idolaters, and everyone of false speech and false life.’

    > 16 I, Jesus, have sent my angel to attest these things to you for the sake of the churches. I am the sprig from the root of David and the bright star of the morning. *(NJB)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), because there is no sign in the Greek that the speaker changes in 22:14 (interpretation 2\), and 22:12–13 are more appropriate coming from Jesus than from the angel (22:9–11\).

#### 22:12a

**“Behold, I am coming soon,**

* ¶ “Look/Listen,(plur) I am coming quickly!
* ¶ Jesus said, “Indeed/Hey, I will come without delay!

**Behold:** This word means “look.” The word emphasizes or calls attention to the words that follow. It is not a command to look at something. See how you translated this word in 22:7\.

**I am coming soon:** This clause refers to Jesus coming back to his people on earth. The Greek word that the BSB translates as *soon* can also mean “without delay” or “quickly.” See how you translated this clause in 22:7\.

#### 22:12b

**and My reward is with Me,**

* I carry my reward with me (JBP)
* I will bring with me both the rewards and punishments that I will give,

**My reward is with Me:** This clause indicates that Jesus is ready to give a reward. For example:

> I will bring my reward with me (NCV)

**My reward:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *reward* refers to both benefits and punishment. If possible, use a word that refers to both. In some languages two words are needed to refer to both benefits and punishment. For example:

> My reward and my punishment

In some languages it is necessary or more natural to translate the noun *reward* as a verb or verbs. For example:

> I will reward and I will punish

#### 22:12c

**to give to each one according to what he has done.**

* and will give to each person as his deeds deserve.
* and I will repay every person good or bad according to their good or bad deeds.

**to give to each one according to what he has done:** This clause indicates that Jesus will both reward good deeds and punish bad deeds. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> I will give to each person as his deeds deserve

> I will repay all people according to what they have done

#### 22:13a–c

**I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End:** These three titles are similar in meaning. Together they emphasize the similar meaning of the titles.

#### 22:13a

**I am the Alpha and the Omega,**

* I am the Alpha and Omega,
* I am the First and the Last over all things,

**I am the Alpha and the Omega:** *Alpha* is the name of the first letter of the Greek alphabet. *Omega* is the name of the last letter of that alphabet. Here the phrase *the Alpha and the Omega* is used as a title. It is also a figure of speech. It indicates that Jesus is eternal and has authority over all things. See how you translated this phrase in 1:8 or 21:6\.

#### 22:13b

**the First and the Last,**

* the First and Last,
* I am the First Being and Last Being,

**the First and the Last:** The title *the First and the Last* indicates that Jesus existed before all things and will exist after everything in this world ends. This title implies that he is therefore greater than anything and has authority over everything. It is similar in meaning to the title “the Alpha and the Omega.”

If possible, you should translate this title in a different way than the title “the Alpha and the Omega,” because both appear here. See how you translated this phrase in 1:17 or 2:8\.

#### 22:13c

**the Beginning and the End.”**

* the Beginning and End.
* I am the Beginning and End of authority.

**the Beginning and the End:** The title *the Beginning and the End* indicates figuratively that Jesus is eternal and has authority over all things. It is similar in meaning to the two previous titles (22:13a–b).

If possible, you should translate this title in a different way than either of those titles. See how you translated this phrase in 21:6\.

#### 22:14a

**Blessed are those who wash their robes,**

* ¶ Favored are those who wash their robes,
* ¶ In a good position in God’s eyes are those who wash their robes, that is, make themselves holy.

**Blessed:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Blessed* describes a person who is a good situation. In the Bible, the good situation results from God showing favor/kindness to the person. See how you translated this word in 22:7\.

**those who wash their robes:** There is a textual issue in 22:14a: (1\) Early Greek manuscripts have the text the ones washing their robes (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some later Greek manuscripts have the text the ones doing his commandments (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT recommends it. This phrase refers figuratively to becoming clean from their sins. The blood of Jesus cleansed them (7:14\).

In some languages a literal translation would not indicate the figurative meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the figurative meaning in your translation. For example:

    > those who wash their robes, that is, become clean from their sins

* Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:

    > those who become clean from their sins *You may then want to indicate the literal phrase in a footnote. An example footnote is:*

Literally: “those who wash their robes.”

* Translate the literal meaning and explain its figurative meaning in a footnote. For example:

    > This refers figuratively to becoming clean from their sins.

See how you translated a similar phrase (“have washed their robes”) in 7:14\.

**wash their robes:** This phrase implies that the robes were dirty. For example:

> wash their robes clean (GNT)

#### 22:14b

**so that they may have the right to the tree of life**

* so that they will have access to the tree of life
* So then, they will have the privilege to eat the fruit of the tree that gives eternal life

**so that:** The conjunction *so that* introduces the result of washing their robes. Other ways to translate this word are:

> and so (GNT)

> that (NIV)

**they may have the right to the tree of life:** This clause indicates that the people who wash their robes have permission or the privilege to eat the fruit of *the tree of life*. Other ways to translate this clause are:

> will be permitted to…eat the fruit from the tree of life (NLT)

> They shall be free to eat from the tree of life (REB)

**the tree of life:** This phrase indicates that *the tree* is a source of *life*. Those who eat the fruit will have eternal life. For example:

> life\-giving tree

See how you translated this phrase in 2:7 or 22:2\.

#### 22:14c

**and may enter the city by its gates.**

* and will be able to enter the city though the gates.
* and the privilege to enter the city at/by the gates.

**may enter the city by its gates:** The people who wash their robes will be able to enter the city. For example:

> may go through the gates into the city (NIV)

**But outside are the dogs, the sorcerers,**

* Outside are depraved people, sorcerers,
* Outside the city are those who do detestable/vile things, those who do witchcraft/sorcery,

**But outside:** The word *outside* refers to everything that is outside of the city. It indirectly refers to those who are not a part of the group whom God has blessed.

**the dogs:** This word refers figuratively to people who do perverted or vile things. In some languages the word *dogs* does not have that figurative meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:

    > perverts (GNT)

    > the depraved (JBP)

    > those who do vile/abominable things

* Translate the literal meaning and explain its figurative meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > Here the word “dogs” refers figuratively to people who do perverted or vile things.

**the sorcerers:** This phrase refers to people who do sorcery or magic. The word “sorcery” refers to any method used to get something by supernatural means. This could include using spells, magic potions, and contacting evil spirits. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> those who practice magic arts (NIV)

> those who do sorcery or magic

See how you translated this phrase in 21:8\.

#### 22:15b

**the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters,**

* adulterers/fornicators, murderers, idolaters,
* those who do sexual immorality, those who murder others, those who worship idols,

**the sexually immoral:** This phrase refers to people who have sexual relations with anyone who is not their spouse. This phrase refers to both men and women. Use a word or phrase that refers to all kinds of sexual sin. For example:

> adulterers/fornicators

> those who sin sexually

See how you translated this phrase in 21:8\.

**the murderers:** This phrase refers to people who kill others deliberately and unlawfully. See how you translated this phrase in 21:8\.

**the idolaters:** This phrase refers to people who consider certain images or statues to be gods or representations of gods. They worship and pray to them. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> those who worship idols (GNT)

> worshipers of false gods

See how you translated this phrase in 21:8\.

#### 22:15c

**and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.**

* and liars who love lying and do it/so all the time.
* and those who enjoy lying and lie habitually.

**everyone who loves and practices falsehood:** The word *falsehood* refers to purposely deceiving people. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> everyone who loves and practices lying (NASB)

> all who love to tell lies and do so all the time

**practices falsehood:** Here this phrase indicates that they have the habit of telling lies.

#### 22:16b

**to give you this testimony for the churches.**

* to testify about those things to you(plur) for the churches.
* to explain accurately to you those things for the benefit of the gatherings of believers.

#### 22:16a–b

**to give you this testimony:** The Greek phrase is literally “to testify these things to you.” The word “testify” means “to tell/report what one saw.” The word is often used when the person speaking is expected to be truthful and accurate. The angel showed everything in Revelation to John. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> faithfully report these things to you

> accurately explain those things to you

**for the churches:** Here the word *for* means “for the benefit of.” Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> for the sake of the churches (NJB)

> on behalf of the churches

**churches:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *churches* refers generally to gatherings of people. Someone summoned the people for a particular purpose. Here, as almost always in the NT, it refers to groups of believers. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> congregations

> groups of believers

> gatherings of believers

See how you translated this word in 1:4\.

#### 22:16c

**I am the Root and the Offspring of David,**

* I am the Root of David and the Descendant of David,
* I am the Shoot of David and his promised descendant.

**the Root and the Offspring of David:** This phrase combines two symbolic titles for Jesus. Jesus is *the Root…of David*, as in 5:5b. He is also *the Offspring of David*. This second title indicates that Jesus is the promised descendant of King David who saved his people. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> I am the root and the descendant of David (NASB)

> I am both the Shoot of David and the heir to his throne

**the Root…of David:** Here the word *Root* probably refers to a shoot that grows from the root of a plant when the main plant has been cut off. This phrase is a combination of Isaiah 11:1 and 11:10\. This title refers to the promised leader of God’s people who was to be a descendant of David.

In some languages the meaning of *the Root…of David* is not clear. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:

    > the special/unique Descendant of David

    > the promised Heir of David

    > the one who renews/restores David’s kingship

* Translate the literal meaning and explain its figurative meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > This phrase is a combination of Isaiah 11:1 and 11:10\. It indicates that Jesus was the promised leader of God’s people who was to be a descendant of David.

Translate this phrase as you did in 5:5\.

#### 22:16d

**the bright Morning Star.”**

* and the shining Star of the Morning/Dawn.”
* I am the radiant Morning/Dawn Star.”

**the bright Morning Star:** There is a textual issue in 22:16d: Early Greek manuscripts have the word morning (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) A few later Greek manuscripts have the words and morning (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. This title is a symbol for the Christ, perhaps based on Numbers 24:17\. You may want to explain the symbolic meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

> The “Morning Star” is a symbol for the Christ here.

#### 22:17a

**The Spirit and the bride say, “Come!”**

* ¶ The Spirit and the bride say, “Come!”(sing)
* ¶ The Holy Spirit and the bride say, “Come!”

**The Spirit:** This phrase refers to the Holy Spirit. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer to someone else. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain its meaning in your translation. For example:

> The Holy Spirit

**bride:** This word symbolically refers to believers. They have been made ready to live with Jesus (19:7c–d). You may want to explain the meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

> The word “bride” refers to all believers. They have been made ready to live with Jesus as a symbolic bride (19:7\).

**Come:** This command in the Greek is singular. It may refer to:

1. An invitation to anyone seeking God (22:17c). The command invites him/her to come and follow Jesus.
2. An invitation to Jesus to return.

Translate this word so that it allows both interpretations in your translation. All fifteen English versions in *Translator’s Workplace* translate the literal meaning. They do not say who is invited to *Come*.

#### 22:17b

**Let the one who hears say, “Come!”**

* Let anyone who hears also say, “Come!”(sing)
* Let the ones/people who hear this message say, “Come!”

**Let the one who hears say, “Come!”:** This clause commands anyone who accepts the message of Revelation to give the same invitation as in 22:17a.

**the one:** Here the words *the one* refer to any person, whether male or female.

#### 22:17c

**And let the one who is thirsty come, and the one who desires the water of life drink freely.**

* Whoever is thirsty, let him freely take/drink the life\-giving water, indeed, whoever desires to come, let him come.
* All who are thirsty and desire to come, come(plur) and take/drink for free the water that causes/gives eternal life.

**And let the one who is thirsty come, and the one who desires the water of life drink freely:** The Greek words are literally “the one thirsting, let him come, the one desiring, let him freely take the water of life.” It repeats the meaning to emphasize it. This is a poetic way to emphasize something. The *one who is thirsty* is the same person as the one called *the one who desires*. Coming is the same response as drinking *the water of life*.

The words of 22:17c are a metaphor. It invites people to believe in Jesus. Other ways to translate these words are:

> Then let all who are thirsty come: all who want it may have the water of life, and have it free. (NJB)

> Come, whoever is thirsty; accept the water of life as a gift, whoever wants it. (GNT)

> Whoever is thirsty, let him freely take/drink the water of life. Indeed, whoever desires to come, let him come.

> Whoever is thirsty and desires to come, let him come and freely take/drink the water of life.

In some languages a translation of the literal meaning would not have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:

* Explain the meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:

    > This sentence invites people to believe in Jesus.

* Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:

    > Whoever is thirsty, let him come and believe; and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life.

    > Whoever desires life with Jesus, let him come and believe; and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life.

**the water of life:** This phrase indicates that *the water* is a source of eternal life. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> water that gives eternal life

## Revelation 22:18 (id: 523414)

### Section 22:6–21: Conclusion

This is the last division of the book of Revelation and the last section. In it, the angel, Jesus, John, and the Holy Spirit spoke some final messages.

The angel of 21:9–22:5 affirmed that the book of Revelation is true. Then Jesus reminded the readers that he will return to earth. He also encouraged the readers to believe what was in this book. Then the angel told John to make this message known to other believers.

Then Jesus again spoke words of encouragement to believers. The Holy Spirit and the church invited all people to come to Jesus and believe in him. Then John warned everyone not to add any words to this book or remove any part of it. Jesus again reminded the readers that he will return. John agreed and ended the book with a blessing on God’s people.

Other examples of headings are:

> Ending messages/announcements to endorse/approve the book

> Final words to encourage the readers

> Jesus, the angel, the Holy Spirit, and John conclude the book

#### 22:18a

**I testify to everyone who hears the words of prophecy in this book:**

* ¶ I testify to everyone who hears the messages/sayings of prophecy in this book:
* ¶ I, John, solemnly declare to everyone who hears the prophecies in this book:

**I testify to everyone who hears the words of prophecy in this book:** The warning is told in 22:18b–19c. The BSB indicates that the warning is told after this clause by using a colon (:) at the end of the clause. Other ways to translate the clause are:

> Here is my warning for everyone who hears the prophecies in this book: (CEV)

> My warning to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book is this:

**I:** Here, this pronoun probably refers to John.The other possibility is Jesus, but then it would be more natural to introduce him here rather than at 22:20\. Beale (page 1154\) at verse 20 says, “Verses 16 and 18 have said that the angel and John have given ‘testimony’ respectively by revealing and writing down the Apocalypse. The Spirit should also be viewed as a third witness (cf. possibly 19:10, as well as the concluding verse of each of the seven letters in chapters 2–3\). Now Jesus is identified as a fourth ‘witness.’” For example:

> I, John, (GNT)

**testify:** The word *testify* refers to saying something that is truthful and accurate. Here the word indicates that people should accept the warnings spoken in 22:18b–19c. For example:

> solemnly declare (NLT)

**prophecy:** The word *prophecy* refers to a message that God gives to someone. The message may include a vision, as in Ezekiel 1 and Daniel 8\. This word refers to 2:1–22:16 here. See how you translated this word in 22:7\.

#### 22:18b

**If anyone adds to them,**

* If anyone adds to those words,
* If anyone adds anything to these words, (NCV)

**If anyone adds to them:** This clause refers to changing the meaning of anything that John had written in this book either by:

1. adding words that he had not written,
2. adding meanings that he did not intend.

John wanted his readers to teach and copy his visions and prophecies exactly as he had written them.

Other ways to translate this clause are:

> If anyone adds anything to what is written here (NLT)

> If anyone adds to these words (JBP)

#### 22:18c

**God will add to him the plagues described in this book.**

* God will add the disasters that are written in this book to his woes/troubles.
* God will add to his suffering the plagues which I wrote about in this book.

**God will add to him the plagues described in this book:** The phrase *add to him the plagues* indicates what God will do to anyone who adds to the book of Revelation. He will cause *the plagues described in this book* to happen to that person.

The word *add* poetically connects this clause with 22:18b. If possible, use the word *add* here as well. For example:

> God will add the plagues described in this book to his woes/troubles.

**the plagues described in this book:** The Greek words are literally “the plagues having been written in this book.” This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active or intransitive clause. For example:

> the plagues which I wrote in this book

> the plagues in this book

**plagues:** This word refers to disasters that harm a lot of people. It can refer to diseases that kill many people. It can refer to locusts that damage many crops.

Some languages do not have a general word such as *plagues* for that meaning. If that is true in your language, you may need to use a descriptive phrase. For example:

> things that cause much suffering

See how you translated the word *plagues* in 6:8 or 15:1\.

## Revelation 22:19 (id: 523416)

### Section 22:6–21: Conclusion

This is the last division of the book of Revelation and the last section. In it, the angel, Jesus, John, and the Holy Spirit spoke some final messages.

The angel of 21:9–22:5 affirmed that the book of Revelation is true. Then Jesus reminded the readers that he will return to earth. He also encouraged the readers to believe what was in this book. Then the angel told John to make this message known to other believers.

Then John warned everyone not to add any words to this book or remove any part of it. Jesus again reminded the readers that he will return. John agreed and ended the book with a blessing on God’s people.

Other examples of headings are:

> Final words to encourage the readers

> Jesus, the angel, the Holy Spirit, and John conclude the book

#### 22:19a

**And if anyone takes away from the words of this book of prophecy,**

* And if anyone removes anything from this book of prophecy,
* If anyone subtracts/removes words/meaning from this book of prophecy,

**And if anyone takes away from the words of this book of prophecy:** This clause refers to changing the meaning of anything that John had written by:

1. removing words that he had written,
2. denying the truth of any meaning in it.

Other ways to translate this clause are:

> if anyone removes any of the words from this book of prophecy (NLT)

> if anyone removes any truth from this book of prophecy

#### 22:19b

**God will take away his share in the tree of life**

* God will remove from him his share/portion/part in the tree of life
* God will subtract/remove from him the right to eat the fruit of the tree that gives eternal life

**God will take away:** The phrase *take away* poetically connects this clause with 22:19a. If possible, use the phrase *take away* here as well.

**share:** The word *share* refers to a part or portion of something. This person will not receive the privilege of eating the fruit from the tree of life. In other words, he will not receive eternal life. Other ways to translate this word are:

> portion (GW)

> shared right/privilege

**the tree of life:** There is a textual issue in 22:19b: (1\) Early Greek manuscripts have the word tree (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some later Greek manuscripts have the word book (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. This phrase indicates that *the tree* is a source of eternal *life*. See how you translated this phrase in 22:14\.

##### **General Comment on 22:18b–19b**

The warnings in 22:18b–19b are told to everyone who might try to change John’s prophecies. In some languages it is more natural to use plural forms. For example:

> 18bif any add anything to them, 18cGod will add to their punishment the plagues described in this book. 19aAnd if any take anything away from the prophetic words of this book, 19bGod will take away from them their share of the fruit of the tree of life (GNT)

In some languages it is more natural to use second person forms. For example:

> 18bIf you add anything to them, 18cGod will make you suffer…. 19aIf you take anything away…19bGod will not let you have part…. (CEV)

#### 22:19c

**and the holy city, which are described in this book.**

* and in the holy city, which are described in this book.
* and will subtract/remove from him the right to enter the holy city. I wrote about those things in this book.

**the holy city:** The new Jerusalem is *the holy city* because God will live there. Here the word *holy* indicates that the city is dedicated for God’s use. His people will live there. Nothing evil will live there. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the city set apart

> God’s city

See how you translated this phrase in 21:2 or 21:10\.

**which are described in this book:** The Greek clause is literally “having been written in this book.” This clause refers to both “the tree of life” and “the holy city.” It is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:

> which I wrote about in this book

> which are in this book

This clause gives more information about “the tree of life” and “the holy city.” In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other trees of life and holy cities. It would also indicate that John only wrote about these trees of life and holy city. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it gives more information about them. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:

> I wrote about those things in this book.

## Revelation 22:20 (id: 523417)

### Section 22:6–21: Conclusion

This is the last division of the book of Revelation and the last section. In it, the angel, Jesus, John, and the Holy Spirit spoke some final messages.

The angel of 21:9–22:5 affirmed that the book of Revelation is true. Then Jesus reminded the readers that he will return to earth. He also encouraged the readers to believe what was in this book. Then the angel told John to make this message known to other believers.

#### 22:20a

**He who testifies to these things says, “Yes, I am coming soon.”**

* ¶ He who testifies that all those things are true says, “Yes, I am coming quickly!”
* ¶ He who confirms those prophecies says, “Yes, I will come without delay!”

**He who testifies to these things:** The word *testifies* refers to saying something that is truthful and accurate. Jesus agreed that the prophecies and visions in this book are truthful and accurate. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> He, who is witness to all this (JBP)

> Jesus, the One who says these things are true (NCV)

**these things:** This phrase refers to the whole book of Revelation. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> all this (GNT)

> those things

> those prophecies

**I am coming soon:** This clause refers to Jesus returning to his people on earth. The Greek word that the BSB translates as *soon* can also refer to “without delay” or “quickly.” See how you translated this clause in 22:12\.

#### 22:20b

**Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!**

* ¶ Lord Jesus, amen. Come.
* ¶ Even so, Lord Jesus, come!

**Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!:** There is a textual issue in 22:20b: Early Greek manuscripts have the word come (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some later Greek manuscripts have the words yes come (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. The direct address to Jesus occurs after what is said to him. In some languages it is more natural to have the direct address first. For example:

> Lord Jesus, amen, come!

**Amen:** The word *Amen* is a Hebrew word that means “even so” or “it is true.” It is used to agree with what was said. The Greek borrowed the Hebrew word. English borrowed this word as well. See how you translated this word in 1:6 or 19:4\.

**Lord:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Lord* means “the one who has authority over (something),” or “owner.” God has authority over everyone and everything. See how you translated this word in 22:5\.

## Revelation 22:21 (id: 523419)

### Section 22:6–21: Conclusion

This is the last division of the book of Revelation and the last section. In it, the angel, Jesus, John, and the Holy Spirit spoke some final messages.

The angel of 21:9–22:5 affirmed that the book of Revelation is true. Then Jesus reminded the readers that he will return to earth. He also encouraged the readers to believe what was in this book. Then the angel told John to make this message known to other believers.

Then Jesus again spoke words of encouragement to believers. The Holy Spirit and the church invited all people to come to Jesus and believe in him. Then John warned everyone not to add any words to this book or remove any part of it. Jesus again reminded the readers that he will return. John agreed and ended the book with a blessing on God’s people.

Other examples of headings are:

> Final words to encourage the readers

> Jesus, the angel, the Holy Spirit, and John conclude the book

#### 22:21

**The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints. Amen.**

* May the grace/favor of the Lord Jesus be with everyone.
* May the Lord Jesus bless all of you with his grace/kindness.

**The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints:** There is a textual issue in 22:21: Some early Greek manuscripts have the text the Lord Jesus (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2\) Some later Greek manuscripts have the text our Lord Jesus Christ (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT recommends it. There is a textual issue here about the phrase *all the saints*:

1. Some Greek manuscripts say all. For example:

    > everyone (GNT) *(GNT, NJB, NASB, NABRE, GW, CEV, NET, REB, ESV, NCV, KJV)*

2. Some Greek manuscripts say all the saints. For example:

    > all the saints (RSV) *(BSB, RSV)*

3. Some Greek manuscripts say the saints. For example:

    > God’s holy people (NLT) *(NIV, NLT)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it, saying that option is nearly certain.

The whole clause is a blessing of farewell. John blessed his readers by expressing his desire that God would give grace to them.

Other ways to translate the whole clause are:

> May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with everyone (GNT)

> May the Lord Jesus bless all of you with his grace

> May all of you have the grace/favor of our Lord Jesus

**grace:** Here this word refers to God being kind to those who do not deserve his kindness. God is kind to people because he wants to be kind and not because they earned his kindness. John wanted God to show *grace* to his readers. Other ways to translate this word are:

> kind (CEV)

> help

> favor

In some languages, it is necessary to translate *grace* using a verb. For example:

> voluntarily/graciously be kind

> help as a gift/favor

**Amen:** There is a textual issue here:

1. Some Greek manuscripts do not have the word. *(GNT, NABRE, NLT, CEV, NET, REB)*
2. Some Greek manuscripts have the word. For example:

    > Amen (RSV) *(BSB, RSV, NIV, NJB, NASB, GW, NCV, ESV, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\), because the UBS Greek NT supports it. But if the major language version follows option (2\), you may want to follow that.
