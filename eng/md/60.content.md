## 1 Peter 1:1 (id: 474487)

### Section 1:1–2: Peter greeted his readers

In this section, Peter began his letter by greeting the believers to whom he was writing his letter.

Peter began this letter in the usual way that people wrote letters during the time that he lived. First, he wrote his name, “Peter.” Then he added a description of himself: “an apostle of Jesus Christ.” Next, he identified the people to whom he was writing. He was writing to the Christians living in five areas of Asia Minor, and he included a description of these Christians in 1:2a–d. Finally, Peter gave them a Christian greeting or blessing in 1:2e.

In some languages it is more common for a writer to begin a letter by mentioning the people who will receive it before he mentions his own name. If it is not polite in your language to put the author’s name first, it may be necessary to reorder the information. For example:

> To God’s elect from Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ: I write to you who are strangers….

> This letter is for those who have been chosen by God and who are living as strangers in the world, who are scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia. It is I, Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, who am writing to you.

However, try to find a polite way in your language to maintain the original order, if possible.

Other possible headings for the section are:

> Greetings from Peter (NLT)

> Peter began his letter to scattered believers/Christians

#### 1:1a

**Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ,**

* ¶ From Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ.
* ¶ I, Peter, am writing this letter. I am an apostle of Jesus Christ.
* ¶ This letter is from me, Peter, a leader whom Jesus Christ has sent to do his work.

**Peter:** The author began his letter by giving his name. In some languages it may be more natural to use a statement here, such as:

> I, Peter, am writing this letter

**an apostle of Jesus Christ:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *apostle* is literally “sent one.” It refers to a person who is sent by someone to accomplish a purpose. An apostle has authority from the one who sent him. *Jesus Christ* chose apostles and gave them authority. After he returned to heaven, his apostles were the leaders for those who believed in him. Peter was one of those apostles.

If you have already translated the Gospels, you may want to use the same word for *apostle* as you used there. Some ways to translate *an apostle of Jesus Christ* are:

> one whom Jesus Christ sent on a mission

> a person with authority from Jesus Christ to do his work

> a chief leader in Jesus Christ’s work

**Christ:** The word *Christ* is used in two ways in the New Testament:

* It is used as a name (that is, “Jesus Christ” or “Christ”).
* It is used as a title that means “the anointed one” (that is, “the Messiah” or “the Christ”).

In this letter, Peter used *Christ* as a name. Often it occurs with Jesus, as it does in this verse, *Jesus Christ*.In some other verses in this letter, Peter used “Christ” alone, as a name (see 1:11, 1:19, 2:21, 3:15–18, 4:1, 4:13–14, 5:1, 5:10, and 5:14\).

#### 1:1b

**To the elect**

* To you, who are among God’s chosen people,
* I greet you, who are people whom God has selected as his own

**the elect:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *the elect* means “God’s chosen ones,” that is, “(people) whom God chose.” God chose them and all other people who believe in Jesus to be his special people.This idea is also found in Mark 13:20 and 2 Timothy 2:10\. Some possible ways to translate *the elect* are:

> God’s chosen people

> the people whom God has chosen to be his own special people

In this context Peter was writing to *the elect* in certain provinces. He did not mean that those people were the only people whom God had chosen. The Greek text indicates this by connecting the ideas of being strangers and being scattered. In some languages it may be necessary to indicate it in the first clause. For example:

> you who are among God’s chosen people

#### 1:1c

**who are exiles**

* foreigners in this world
* and who are living for a while as visitors among other people

#### 1:1c–d

**exiles of the Dispersion:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *exiles* refers to people who are living in a foreign country rather than in their own native country. This may be a simple geographic reference by which Peter is identifying the recipients of his letter. However, there could also be a sense here that the true home of believers in Jesus is heaven, not this world. Some translations bring out that sense.

Other ways to translate this are:

> living as foreigners (NLT)

> temporary residents in the world (GW)

#### 1:1d

**of the Dispersion throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, chosen**

* dispersed throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. You were chosen
* in various places in the lands of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. God chose you,

**of the Dispersion:** The Greek word that the BSB literally translates as *of the Dispersion* is the noun form of the verb “disperse,” which means “cause to go in different directions” or “scatter.” In Peter’s time, Jewish people who did not live in their own land of Israel referred to themselves in this way. Peter is using the term to refer to Christians, both Jews and Gentiles, to identify them as living in or near the Jewish communities that were outside of Israel but perhaps also to suggest that they are not currently living in their true land, which is heaven.

. Some ways to translate this word include:

> dispersed

> living in various places

**Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia:** These were the names of different provinces or areas where the Christians to whom Peter was writing lived. They were all located in the western part of the modern country of Turkey.

**chosen:** The BSB has supplied the word *chosen*, which has the same meaning as “elect” in 1:1b. The BSB did this to show the connection between the ideas in verses 1 and 2\. In Greek the ideas in 1:2a explain more about the “elect” in 1:1b. Be sure to make this connection clear in your language. Some ways to do this are:

* Mention the idea again in 1:2, as the NIV does:

    > 1bTo God’s elect…2awho have been chosen

* Wait until 1:2 to mention the idea “chosen,” as the RSV does:

    > 1bTo the exiles…2achosen

* Reorder 1:1 (see the General Comment on 1:1b–d below):

    > …who are chosen by God

Use a natural connection in your language. In some languages it may also be more natural to express the idea as an active clause. For example:

> God chose you

##### **General Comment on 1:1b–d**

In some languages it may be more natural to reorder 1b–c. For example:

> I am writing to you people who are 1dlocated in the provinces of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, 1cand who are only temporary residents of this world. 1bGod has chosen you.

> 1cto those living as foreigners/sojourners 1din Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, 1bwho are chosen by God.

Such a reordering may also help you to make a natural connection with the next verse.

### Section 1:1–2: Peter greeted his readers

In this section, Peter began his letter by greeting the believers to whom he was writing his letter.

Peter began this letter in the usual way that people wrote letters during the time that he lived. First, he wrote his name, “Peter.” Then he added a description of himself: “an apostle of Jesus Christ.” Next, he identified the people to whom he was writing. He was writing to the Christians living in five areas of Asia Minor, and he included a description of these Christians in 1:2a–d. Finally, Peter gave them a Christian greeting or blessing in 1:2e.

In some languages it is more common for a writer to begin a letter by mentioning the people who will receive it before he mentions his own name. If it is not polite in your language to put the author’s name first, it may be necessary to reorder the information. For example:

> To God’s elect from Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ: I write to you who are strangers….

> This letter is for those who have been chosen by God and who are living as strangers in the world, who are scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia. It is I, Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, who am writing to you.

However, try to find a polite way in your language to maintain the original order, if possible.

Other possible headings for the section are:

> Greetings from Peter (NLT)

> Peter began his letter to scattered believers/Christians

#### 1:2

There are different ways to interpret the connections between the ideas in 1:2\. The Notes on 1:2a–e discuss the ideas and connections in detail. Here is a summary:

1. God the Father chose the believers to whom Peter was writing (and all who believe in Jesus) to be his own people.
2. God knew the believers before he chose them, and his choice agreed with that knowledge.
3. God chose the believers by the work of his Spirit to make them holy as his own people.
4. God chose them so that they would obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with his blood.

Notice that (c) expresses the means by which God chose the believers and (d) expresses the purpose for which he chose them.

#### 1:2a

**according to the foreknowledge of God the Father**

* in agreement with God the Father’s prior knowledge of you,
* and God the Father knew you long ago,
* just as he, the Father, had already known you long before.

**according to the foreknowledge of God the Father:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *according to* means “in agreement with.” God knew the believers before he chose them, and his choice was consistent with what he already knew of them.

In some languages it is necessary to change the order of choosing and knowing. For example, the GW says:

> God the Father knew you long ago and chose you

**the foreknowledge of God the Father:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *foreknowledge* indicates that what God planned in the past, God makes sure will happen according to his plan. The word does not indicate when in the past God made his plan.Ephesians 1:4 indicates that God chose believers before he created the world. This fact implies that God knew people even before he created them. In some languages it may be necessary to include a general expression like:

> much earlier

> long ago (NLT)

The phrase may be expressed in several ways:

> God planned long ago to choose you (NCV)

> God the Father chose you long ago according to his plan

> God the Father purposed long ago to choose you

If your language uses passive verbs, you could say:

> It was God the Father’s purpose long ago to choose you

#### 1:2b

**and sanctified by the Spirit**

* by/through the work the Holy Spirit did to dedicate/indicate you as holy for him/God,
* by the Holy Spirit setting you apart for him/God
* He chose you through what the Holy Spirit did to sanctify/consecrate you to God.

**and sanctified by the Spirit:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *and* is literally “in” or “by.” There are several ways to understand the way that this part of the verse relates to 1:1b–1:2a:

1. The sanctifying work of the Spirit was the means by which God chose Peter’s readers to be his own people. For example, the NASB says:

    > \[chosen…] by the sanctifying work of the Spirit *(NIV, KJV, NCV, REB, NASB)*

2. The sanctifying work of the Spirit was another thing that God did for Peter’s readers. For example, the GNT says:

    > \[You were chosen…] and were made a holy people by his Spirit *(BSB, RSV, CEV, NLT, GNT)*

3. The sanctifying work of the Spirit was the purpose for which God chose Peter’s readers. For example, the NJB says:

    > \[chosen] to be made holy by the Spirit *(GW, NJB)*

It is recommended that you choose interpretation (1\). God’s Spirit sanctified (set apart) the people for God as his own. This was the way that God chose them.

**sanctified by the Spirit:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *sanctified by the Spirit* means that God’s Holy Spirit had sanctified Peter’s readers. To “sanctify” something is to set it apart as holy and belonging to God. In this context the Spirit had made Peter’s readers holy and had set them apart for God. Now they belonged to God alone. Other ways to translate this are:

> being set apart by the Spirit (NET)

> the consecrating work of the Spirit (REB)

> the Spirit has made you holy (NLT)

> the Spirit setting you apart only for God

#### 1:2c

**for obedience to Jesus Christ**

* in order that you would become obedient to Jesus Christ
* God did this so that you would do what Jesus Christ said
* He/God chose you, because he desired/wanted you to obey Jesus Christ

**for obedience to Jesus Christ:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *for* introduces two purposes for which God chose the believers (1:2c and 1:2d). The first purpose was that they would obey Jesus Christ.Though it is not explicit in the Greek text that God chose Peter’s readers to be obedient to Jesus Christ, many translations make this explicit (BSB, CEV, GW, JBP, NASB, NIV, NJB, NLT, NRSV, REB, RSV, GNT). The NCV specifies that the obedience is to God: “God wanted you to obey him.” The KJV and the NET do not make explicit who is to be obeyed. In this context Peter probably implied a special way in which they had obeyed. They had obeyed Jesus Christ by believing in him and recognizing him as their Lord whom they would continue to obey forever. Other ways to translate this are:

> to be obedient to Jesus Christ

> in order that you would obey Jesus Christ

> because he/God wanted you to obey Jesus Christ

#### 1:2d

**and sprinkling by His blood:**

* and in order that you would be sprinkled with his/Jesus’ blood.
* and so that Jesus’ blood would be sprinkled on you to purify you.
* and he wanted to cause the blood from Jesus’ death to clean you.

**sprinkling by His blood:** This phrase is a figure of speech that tells the second purpose for which God chose the believers. Jesus’ *blood* symbolizes his death. The action of *sprinkling* the *blood* symbolizes that God purifies believers from their sins because Jesus died for them. It does not imply that Jesus’ literal blood would be sprinkled on them.

The symbol of sprinkling a person with blood was used in the Old Testament. In Exodus 24:3–8, Moses sprinkled the blood of bulls on the people of Israel in order to symbolize that God was purifying them.An alternative way to understand the metaphor is as a figure of speech illustrating the sealing of the covenant. See the footnote in the CEV, which says: According to Exodus 24:3–8, the people of Israel were sprinkled with the blood of cows to show they would keep their agreement with God. Peter says that it is the blood of Jesus that seals the agreement between God and his people. However, this understanding is not reflected in the texts of any of the main English versions.

Here are possible ways to translate this:

* Translate both the figure of speech and its meaning. For example:

    > so that God would declare you not guilty of your sins because of Jesus Christ’s death, as though his blood was sprinkled on you

    > to be sprinkled by his blood that purifies you from your sins

* Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:

    > \[to] be purified by his blood. (GNT)

    > so that God might use the blood/death of Jesus Christ to make/declare you pure/not guilty

* Translate the figure of speech and include a footnote to explain the meaning. An example of a possible footnote is:

    > Jesus’ blood symbolized his death for people. In the Old Testament, Moses sprinkled the Israelites with blood from bulls sacrificed to God. This was a symbol that God was purifying them. See Exodus 24:3–8 and Leviticus 14:6–7\. Now God purifies believers from their sins and declares them forgiven because Jesus died for them.

**His blood:** The *blood* of Jesus Christ refers to blood that he shed when he died. You may need to make this explicit. For example:

> the blood of his death

> his life blood

#### 1:2e

**Grace and peace be yours in abundance.**

* May God show you much grace and give you much peace.
* May God greatly favour you and fill you with peaceful contentment.
* I pray that God will be very good to you and increase your peace more and more.

**Grace and peace be yours in abundance:** During the time that Peter wrote this letter, Christians often greeted each other by saying “Grace and peace to you.” It was a sort of blessing. Here Peter expressed his desire for God to bless his readers. If you have a similar form of greeting or blessing in your language, you may be able to use it here. Refer to your translation of the similar phrases in Romans 1:7; 1 Corinthians 1:3; and Philippians 1:2\.

Some English versions indicate that God is the source/giver of the *Grace and peace* (CEV, NLT). You may do this if it sounds natural in your language and culture. For example:

> May you know more and more of God’s grace and peace (JBP)

* In some languages it may be necessary to use different phrases to express the ideas of *Grace* and *peace*. Notice the two phrases connected by “and” in the examples below:

    > May God show you much grace and give you much peace.

    > May God favor you and calm your hearts/minds more and more.

The Greek word that the BSB translates as *in abundance* is literally “be multiplied.” To have grace and peace *in abundance* means “to have much grace and peace,” “to experience grace and peace greatly or increasingly.” In some languages, there may be an idiom to express this idea. Some ways to translate this are:

> May you receive God’s special favor and live in increasing peace.

> May God favor you more and more and make you supremely content.

**Grace:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Grace* refers to kindness that is shown to people freely, not because they have done anything to deserve it. The Christians added the word *Grace* to the common Jewish greeting of “peace.” In this context, the word refers to God’s grace. He is good to people because he loves them. The people have not done anything to deserve his goodness.

Some other ways to translate this word are:

> kindness

> generous help

> favor

**peace:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *peace* means wholeness or well\-being.Its meaning in this context is the same as the Hebrew word *shalom*, which was used in Jewish greetings and blessings. It describes the calmness that people could feel by knowing that God was taking care of them. For believers in Jesus, it also implies the peace of knowing that God has forgiven them and is pleased with them. They do not have to worry or be afraid.

Another way to say this is:

> that you may be calm/peaceful

In some languages there may be an idiom to express this idea.

##### **General Comment on 1:2e**

Your language may usually require you to translate both of the nouns *Grace* and *peace* with a clause, rather than a single word. However, when you translate greetings, you may want to use a shorter expression. In 1:2e, Peter was greeting his readers, not teaching them about "Grace and peace".

## 1 Peter 1:3 (id: 474489)

### Section 1:3–12: Peter praised God for the great hope that he has given us

In this section, Peter praised God for the new life that his readers had received because Jesus Christ rose from the dead. He also praised God for the good things that God has made ready for his people in heaven (1:3–5\). These blessings from God cause believers to rejoice, even in times of trouble. They have joy because they know that God is saving their souls (1:6–9\). In the final paragraph, Peter reminded his readers of how the Old Testament prophets had earlier prophesied about this salvation. They had foretold that Christ would suffer in order to save people (1:10–12\).

Some other headings for this section are:

> The hope of eternal life (NLT)

> Faith in Christ brings you joy (NET)

> A real reason for hope (CEV)

#### 1:3a

**Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ!**

* Let us(incl) praise the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
* Everyone should bless/praise the God and Father of our(incl) Lord Jesus Christ.
* Our God and Father of our(incl) Lord Jesus Christ is worthy of all praise.

**Blessed be:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Blessed be* means “praised” in such contexts. It was common for the Jews to use a phrase like this as a formal way to affirm that God is worthy to be praised. It indicates that people should praise God by telling others how wonderful and excellent he is. Some other ways to translate this meaning are:

> Let us give thanks to… (GNT)

> All honor to… (NLT)

> Praise… (GW)

**the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ:** There are two ways to interpret the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ*:

1. It means that God is both the God of our Lord Jesus Christ and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. For example, TLB says:

    > God, the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ *(BSB, GW, KJV, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, REB, RSV, GNT)*

2. It means that God is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. For example, the CEV says:

    > God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ *(NJB, CEV, NLT)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), as the majority of English versions do.

#### 1:3b

**By His great mercy He has given us new birth**

* Because he is so merciful, he has caused us(incl) to be born again.
* He has given us(incl) new life/birth because his compassion is so great!
* He is very compassionate, and so he has caused us(incl) to live new lives

**By His great mercy:** The phrase *By His great mercy* here means “because of God’s great mercy.” God’s *great mercy* is the reason why God provided a new birth (1:3b). The GW says:

> God has given us a new birth because of his great mercy.

The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *His great mercy* refers here to the generous compassion that God has for people. He showed great mercy to those who believe in his Son, Jesus Christ. Although they had sinned, he did not punish them but forgave them.

Some other ways to express *His great mercy* are:

> because he is so merciful

> because God is very compassionate

**He has given us new birth:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *has given us new birth* is literally “having caused us to be born again.” This is a figure of speech. It expresses the great change that God made in the lives of Peter and his readers when they believed in Jesus. God made them like new people, and they began a new type of life with him.Goppelt says that “new birth occurs as transposition into a new life situation, namely as the dawn of an…unfailing and effective ‘living hope’” (page 83\). In other words, God caused them to be born into (enter into, begin) a new life. They had a new hope and a new inheritance in heaven (1:3–4\).

**us:** In this letter, the terms *us* and “we” always include Peter’s readers.

**new birth:** The phrase *new birth* does not mean that the believers had been born again as babies. Refer to John 1:12–13, 3:3\. Other ways to translate this are:

> he has caused us to be born again (NCV)

> he has given us new life (CEV)

> he has made our lives new

> he has changed our lives as if we were born again

If you use *birth* or “born” in your translation, you will want to make sure that it does not sound as if Peter said that God had given them children.

#### 1:3c, 4a

**into a living hope**

* We(incl) now live in confident hope
* So now we(incl) expect his blessings with certainty
* of confident expectation,

**into a living hope…and into an inheritance:** In Greek, 1:3c and 1:4a both begin with the word that is often translated as *into* (BSB) or “for.” Many scholars believe that both times, this word introduces a benefit (result) of the new birth that God had given the believers.Elliott, page 333, says, “This is the first of three…*eis* (“for”) phrases…identifying three related results or benefits of God’s regenerating action.” Most English versions have “into a living hope” for the first *eis* phrase (BSB, NRSV, NJB, REB, NET, NCV, NIV). The RSV and KJV have “to” or “unto” respectively. The only real unambiguous readings indicate result (GW, NLT, CEV, GNT). For “into an inheritance,” several versions imply result: BSB, NIV, NJB, NRSV, KJV, and GW. Several indicate that the inheritance is the content of the hope, that is, what is hoped for (NCV, NET, REB, GNT). The difference in content and result in this context may be less than it appears. The new birth gives believers a living hope in an inheritance that is also the result of the new birth. The BSB indicates this by supplying the connector *and*, which is not in the Greek text. In 1:3c, the benefit of the new birth is *hope*, and in 1:4a the benefit is an *inheritance*. Some other ways to translate this are:

> with the result that we have a living hope…and an inheritance

> As a result we have a living hope…and an inheritance

The benefits (blessings) of the new birth are in focus in this context.

**a living hope:** There are two ways to interpret the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *a living hope*:

1. It refers to a hope that would certainly be fulfilled. People could have confidence that they would not be disappointed in that hope. The EASY translation says:

    > as we live, we are sure that we will receive good things from God

2. It refers to “a hope that continues.” People keep hoping year after year without stopping.This interpretation is supported by the UBS Handbook, Selwyn, page 124 (“a hope that is never extinguished by untoward circumstances”), Bigg (“hope is…eternal”), and Grudem, page 55 (“it grows and increases in strength year by year”). The CEV says:

    > a hope that lives on (CEV)

Most English versions are ambiguous, and both ideas are true. However, if you must choose between these interpretations, it is recommended that you choose interpretation (1\).

**hope:** In the New Testament, a *hope* is the confident expectation that something good will happen. In some languages it may be necessary to translate it with a verb phrase. For example:

> we have assurance/certainty

> we confidently expect

In some languages it is necessary to translate *hope* as an action. In some of those languages, it is also necessary to specify what is hoped for. If that is true in your language, you may want to specify that the believers hoped for the inheritance. For example, the REB says:

> hope, the hope of an inheritance (REB)

#### 1:3d

**through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,**

* by means of Jesus Christ rising from death.
* through Jesus Christ living again after his death.
* because he caused Jesus Christ to live again after he died.

**through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead:** The phrase *through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead* indicates that Jesus’ resurrection is the means by which God gave Peter and his readers a new birth into a living hope and an inheritance. For example, the GNT says:

> by raising Jesus Christ from death (GNT)

**the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead:** This context implies that God caused Jesus Christ to live again after his death. In some languages, it may be necessary to make that explicit. For example:

> God gave us this new birth/life by causing Jesus to live again after his death

**resurrection:** The term *resurrection* refers to someone’s body becoming alive again after his death. It does not refer only to his soul or spirit becoming alive again. Some other ways to translate this word are:

> rising from the dead

> being raised to life

> God caused to live again

## 1 Peter 1:4 (id: 474490)

### Section 1:3–12: Peter praised God for the great hope that he has given us

In this section, Peter praised God for the new life that his readers had received because Jesus Christ rose from the dead. He also praised God for the good things that God has made ready for his people in heaven (1:3–5\). These blessings from God cause believers to rejoice, even in times of trouble. They have joy because they know that God is saving their souls (1:6–9\). In the final paragraph, Peter reminded his readers of how the Old Testament prophets had earlier prophesied about this salvation. They had foretold that Christ would suffer in order to save people (1:10–12\).

Some other headings for this section are:

> The hope of eternal life (NLT)

> Faith in Christ brings you joy (NET)

> A real reason for hope (CEV)

#### 1:4a

**and into an inheritance**

* This new life makes us(incl) sure of an inheritance
* God has prepared those blessings for us(incl) as a result of our new life,
* God has prepared good things for us,

**into an inheritance:** In the Old Testament, *inheritance* referred to the land belonging to a family that passed from the father to his heir. In this context, *inheritance* is used in a figurative way. It does not refer here to literal land or possessions that Jesus left his disciples when he died. It refers to blessings such as salvation and eternal life that God gives to people who believe in Jesus Christ as their Savior.While many English versions have the word *inheritance*, two use the word “blessings” (NCV, GNT). The word *inheritance* is used in this way in several other verses in the New Testament.See Hebrews 9:15, compare the use of “heir” in Galatians 4:7; Romans 8:17\. Other verses in the New Testament that use “inheritance” in a similar way are: Acts 20:32; Ephesians 1:14, 5:5; Colossians 3:24\. Some other ways to translate “inheritance” are:

> something stored up for you (CEV)

> blessings God has prepared for us

> the things God has promised to give us

#### 1:4b

**that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading,**

* that will never rot, become impure, or fade away.
* and these blessings will never decay, get soiled/polluted, or lose their beauty.
* and what he gives will always remain fresh, pure, and bright/glorious.

**that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading:** The words *imperishable, undefiled*, and *unfading* are very similar in meaning. They describe various ways in which things may become worthless. In this context they indicate that the spiritual inheritance of believers will last forever.

**is imperishable:** The Greek word that the BSB literally translates as *imperishable* describes something that does not decay, die, or end. Other ways to say this are:

> will never decay

> will never rot

> will always remain fresh/new

> will never diminish in value

**undefiled:** The Greek word that the BSB literally translates as *undefiled* means that nothing can ever mar or pollute the inheritance. It will never diminish in value or goodness. Other ways to say this are:

> cannot be spoiled (NCV)

> will always remain pure

**unfading:** The Greek word that the BSB literally translates as *unfading* means that the inheritance will never fade. To “fade” is to lose brightness or beauty. The inheritance that God gives believers will never lose its brightness or beauty. In this context this word has a figurative meaning, since many of the blessings of the inheritance cannot be seen. These blessings are *unfading* in the sense that they are permanent. Other ways to say this are:

> cannot…lose their beauty (NCV)

> will never…disappear (CEV)

> cannot fade away (GNT)

#### 1:4c

**reserved in heaven for you,**

* God is keeping this inheritance safe in heaven for you,
* God is holding them for you in heaven,
* These things are now/already waiting for you/us(incl) in heaven.

**reserved in heaven:** The phrase *reserved in heaven* means “held in heaven.” This implies that the inheritance is safe and secure. God dwells *in heaven*, and so the inheritance is with him and he guards it.

This is a passive phrase. In some languages, it may be more natural to use an active expression. For example:

> which God has kept/secured in heaven

**heaven:** In this context *heaven* refers to the place where God dwells. Other spiritual beings such as angels also dwell there.

* In languages that do not have a single word for *heaven*, you may need to use a descriptive phrase:

    > the place of God

    > the place where God lives

**for you:** Here Peter changed from referring to “us,” which included Peter and his readers (see 1:3b), to referring to them as *you* (with plural forms). This does not imply that God was not keeping an inheritance for Peter also. Peter was just changing the way he addressed his readers to help them apply his words to themselves.

In the BSB this statement is part of a long sentence that includes both “us” and “you.” In some languages it may be more natural to continue to refer to “us” here and change to “you” in 1:5\.

## 1 Peter 1:5 (id: 474491)

### Section 1:3–12: Peter praised God for the great hope that he has given us

In this section, Peter praised God for the new life that his readers had received because Jesus Christ rose from the dead. He also praised God for the good things that God has made ready for his people in heaven (1:3–5\). These blessings from God cause believers to rejoice, even in times of trouble. They have joy because they know that God is saving their souls (1:6–9\). In the final paragraph, Peter reminded his readers of how the Old Testament prophets had earlier prophesied about this salvation. They had foretold that Christ would suffer in order to save people (1:10–12\).

Some other headings for this section are:

> The hope of eternal life (NLT)

> Faith in Christ brings you joy (NET)

> A real reason for hope (CEV)

#### 1:5

The BSB has translated 1:3b–5 as one sentence. If such long sentences are not natural in your language, it may be better to start a new sentence here. For example, the NCV says:

> God’s power protects you through your faith until salvation is shown to you at the end of time. (NCV)

#### 1:5a

**who through faith are shielded by God’s power**

* who are being guarded by our(incl) powerful God because you trust him.
* and by his power he is protecting you through your faith.
* And since God is strong, he is able to keep you safe as you believe in him.

**who through faith are shielded by God’s power:** This is a passive clause. In some languages it may be more natural to use an active clause. For example:

> God’s power shields you through your faith

> God works powerfully to protect you as you believe in Jesus Christ

**through faith:** The phrase *through faith* indicates that *faith* was the means through which God’s power protected Peter’s readers. In this context the *faith* that Peter referred to was his readers’ faith in God. Here are some other ways to translate *through faith*:

> because you are trusting him (NLT)

> through your faith (NCV)

> the power of God operating through your faith (JBP)

**faith:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *faith* refers here to the action of believing and trusting God. In some languages it may be more natural to translate *faith* as a verb. If that is true in your language, you may also need to say what they believed. They trusted God and believed his promises. Some other ways to translate *faith* are:

> trusted in God

> believed in the promises of God

**shielded by God’s power:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *shielded* means “guarded” or “protected.” Some other ways to translate this word include:

> kept safe (GNT)

> guarded (GW)

> protected (NET)

**God’s power:** It was God himself who protected the believers. He was able to do that because he was powerful. In many languages it may be necessary to make it clear that God himself is the one who would protect them. For example:

> God in his strength

> the powerful God

> Almighty God

#### 1:5b

**for the salvation**

* He is shielding you until it is time for the salvation
* He/God will continue to protect you as you wait for him to completely save you
* He/God will keep you safe until he delivers you from all evil.

**for:** There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as *for*:

1. It introduces the time during which God was protecting them. He would continue to protect them *until* the time when the final salvation is revealed. For example:

    > until salvation is shown to you at the end of time (NCV) *(NIV, NJB, NLT, REB, NCV, CEV JBP)*

2. It introduces the purpose for which God was protecting them. God was protecting them in order to save them. For example:

    > for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time (RSV) *(BSB, GW, KJV, NASB, NET, GNT, RSV)Elliott, page 337, Michaels, page 23, “no longer simply to protect his people.”*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).This part of the verse begins with the Greek word *eis* (“into, for, until”). For the third time in this paragraph it introduces a phrase. Some scholars believe that it is connected to the context in two ways:(a) It is the third benefit of the new birth in 1:3\. Each of those benefits begin with *eis*: a living hope (1:3\) an inheritance (1:4\) salvation (1:5\)(b) It is also (and mainly) connected with “shielded” in 1:5a.In many languages it may not be possible to express both of these connections in your translation. If you must choose, it is most important to express the connection with “shielded.” See Beare (page 84\). The Greek word does not imply that God would stop protecting his people when the salvation came, but they might not need the same type of protection.

**the salvation:** The Greek phrase that the BSB literally translates as *the salvation* refers to being rescued or saved from something harmful or dangerous. A person may be saved from physical dangers such as death or enemies or from spiritual dangers such as sin and its punishment. In this context *salvation* refers to being saved in the future in heaven. At that time God will deliver believers from all sin and suffering. Then they will have the joyful, eternal life that includes the blessings of the inheritance (1:4\). In some languages, it may be necessary to translate *salvation* as a verb or phrase. For example:

> you are saved

> you are rescued

> God saves/rescues you

> God delivers you from all evil

#### 1:5c

**that is ready to be revealed in the last time.**

* that he has prepared to reveal when the time is right in the last days.
* in the way that he will make known at the end of time.
* He is ready to cause everyone to see/know this in the final days of this world.

**that is ready to be revealed:** This is a passive clause. In some languages it may be more natural to use an active expression. For example:

> that God has prepared to reveal to people

> that God has made ready to show you

**revealed:** In some languages it may not be possible to “reveal” or show something that is not a physical object. If that is true in your language, you may need to use a different expression. For example:

> that God will cause everyone to know about

**in the last time:** The Greek word which the BSB translates as *time* refers to a time that has a special purpose. The word does not indicate how long that period of time lasts. In this context *in the last time* refers to the time at the end of this age/world. At that time God’s salvation will be revealed. Some other ways to translate this are:

> at the end of time (GW)

> at the final point of time (NJB)

* **Associated Passages:** 1PE 1:5

## 1 Peter 1:6 (id: 474492)

### Section 1:3–12: Peter praised God for the great hope that he has given us

In this section, Peter praised God for the new life that his readers had received because Jesus Christ rose from the dead. He also praised God for the good things that God has made ready for his people in heaven (1:3–5\). These blessings from God cause believers to rejoice, even in times of trouble. They have joy because they know that God is saving their souls (1:6–9\). In the final paragraph, Peter reminded his readers of how the Old Testament prophets had earlier prophesied about this salvation. They had foretold that Christ would suffer in order to save people (1:10–12\).

Some other headings for this section are:

> The hope of eternal life (NLT)

> Faith in Christ brings you joy (NET)

> A real reason for hope (CEV)

#### 1:6

The two parts of this verse contrast with each other. The believers greatly rejoiced in what God had done for them, even while they were enduring various kinds of troubles. The BSB and many other English versions supply a word like “though” to connect these ideas (1:6a and 1:6b). Consider the best way to connect them in your language, while also keeping the connection between verses 5 and 6\.

In some languages it may be necessary to use two sentences. For example:

> In this you greatly rejoice. It is true that now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials.

#### 1:6a

**In this you greatly rejoice,**

* Because of all these things which God has done, you have great joy,
* You are very happy about all these things that God has done for you.

**In this you greatly rejoice:** There are two ways to interpret the Greek expression that the BSB translates as *In this you greatly rejoice*:

1. Peter’s readers rejoiced because of what God had done for them (1:3–5\). For example:

    > This is a great joy to you (NJB) *(BSB, NIV, NCV, NET, JBP, GW, KJV, NASB, RSV, NJB)*

2. Peter was encouraging his readers to rejoice because of what God had done for them (1:3–5\). For example:

    > Be glad about this (GNT) *(NLT, GNT)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), along with most English versions.

**In this:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *this* refers to all the blessings Peter mentioned in verses 3–5\. It may be more natural in your language to use a plural form. For example:

> You are extremely happy about these things (GW)

**greatly rejoice:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *greatly rejoice* means “be very happy.” Some other ways to translate this word are:

> extremely happy (GW)

> truly glad (NLT)

> are very glad

#### 1:6b

**though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief**

* even though now, for a short time, you must suffer
* even though you must now endure, for a short time,
* It is true that now it is necessary that you endure for a little while

**though:** The BSB has supplied the word *though* here to indicate contrast. See the note on 1:6 above. The believers had to suffer, but even so, they rejoiced. Some other ways to introduce this contrast is:

> even though

> although

> in spite of

Use a natural way in your language to introduce such a contrast.There is a concession\-contraexpectation relationship between these clauses. However, the concessive clause (“though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials”) comes after the contraexpectation (“…you greatly rejoice”).

**now:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *now* is a time word. It refers to the time when Peter was writing. It contrasts with the future time of salvation in 1:5\. Some other ways this may be translated are:

> presently

> at this time

**for a little while:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *for a little while* refers here to a brief time. In this context it means that Peter’s readers would only have to suffer for a short time. The Lord would soon deliver them. Another way to translate this is:

> for a short time (NET)

**you may have had to suffer grief:**There are two ways to interpret Peter’s statement concerning *to suffer grief* in this context:

1. Peter spoke of his readers’ suffering as a fact. He implied that his readers were already suffering.This interpretation is supported by the following commentaries: Kistemaker, page 46; Achtemeier, page 101; Michaels, page 28; and Kelly, page 53\. For example:

    > even though for a short time yet you must bear all sorts of trials (NJB) *(NLT, GW, NJB, NRSV, KJV; probably NIV, REB)*

2. Peter spoke of his readers’ suffering as a possibility. He implied that it was possible that his readers might have to suffer or might have suffered.This interpretation is supported by the following commentaries: Beare, page 86; Best, pages 77–78; Marshall, page 40\. For example:

    > even if you have to go through many hard trials (CEV) *(BSB, NCV, NET, RSV, GNT, CEV; possibly NASB)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), which agrees with most commentators.

The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *you may have had to suffer grief* is more literally “if necessary, you having been grieved.” This grieving from suffering had begun in the past, had continued in the present (“now”), and would continue for a little while in the future. So you should use an expression that would be as general as possible with regard to time.

**suffer grief:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *suffer grief* is literally “be grieved.” It refers to the grief, sadness or emotional pain that people feel when they have trouble. This is a passive verb, and it may be natural for some languages to translate it that way. For example, the ESV says:

> you have been grieved (ESV)

#### 1:6c

**in various trials**

* because of different kinds of trials.
* different kinds of trouble.
* various troubles that cause you grief.

**in various trials:** The Greek phrase that the BSB literally translates as *various trials* refers to the difficulties the people have been experiencing. Languages have different ways to express the experience of bearing such trials. Some ways to say this in English are:

> to be sad…because of the many kinds of trials you suffer (GNT)

> to endure many trials (NLT)

> must bear all sorts of trials (NJB)

**trials:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *trials* refers to the various problems and difficulties Peter’s readers were experiencing. These *trials* included troubles that came from other people who were persecuting them because they believed in Jesus Christ. Another way to say this is:

> different kinds of trouble (GW)

* **Associated Passages:** 1PE 1:6

## 1 Peter 1:7 (id: 474493)

### Section 1:3–12: Peter praised God for the great hope that he has given us

In this section, Peter praised God for the new life that his readers had received because Jesus Christ rose from the dead. He also praised God for the good things that God has made ready for his people in heaven (1:3–5\). These blessings from God cause believers to rejoice, even in times of trouble. They have joy because they know that God is saving their souls (1:6–9\). In the final paragraph, Peter reminded his readers of how the Old Testament prophets had earlier prophesied about this salvation. They had foretold that Christ would suffer in order to save people (1:10–12\).

Some other headings for this section are:

> The hope of eternal life (NLT)

> Faith in Christ brings you joy (NET)

> A real reason for hope (CEV)

#### 1:7

In the Greek text, this verse continues the long sentence that began with 1:6\. However, the sentence is still very complex and it may be helpful to break it up still further. See the General Comment on 1:7 at the end of 1:7e for some suggestions.

In this verse, Peter wrote more about trials and suffering. He told his readers that the people who continue to trust in Jesus Christ when they are tested by troubles will receive praise, glory, and honor when Jesus returns to this earth. Scholars interpret the details of this verse in different ways.

#### 1:7a

**so that the proven character of your faith—**

* These trials must prove that your faith is genuine.
* These troubles test your faith. When the test has proven that your faith is real,
* These troubles show whether you are truly faithful/committed to Jesus Christ.

**so that:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *so that* introduces the purpose of the trials that believers were suffering. In some languages it may be helpful to start a new sentence here. For example:

> These have come so that…. (NIV)

> Their purpose is to prove… (GNT)

> These trials will show that… (NLT)

> God allows these difficulties to happen…

**the proven character of your faith:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *proven character* indicates that something has been tested and that the test has shown that it is real, pure, or sincere. In this context it probably refers to the proven sincerity of the readers’ faith in God. Their trials had tested their faith and shown it to be genuine. Some other ways to translate this expression are:

> will show that your faith is genuine (NLT)

> show the proven character of your faith (NET)

> prove that your faith is pure (NCV)

**your faith:** The word *faith* refers here to the action of trusting someone and believing in him. In this context Peter is speaking of having steadfast loyalty to God/Christ.

In some languages it may be natural to translate *faith* as a verb and to supply the object. For example:

> trust God/Christ

> believe in God/Christ

In some languages it may be necessary to translate *proven character* and *faith* as one or more verb phrases. For example:

> so that when the tests have proved that you have truly/sincerely trusted God

#### 1:7b

**more precious than gold,**

* It is more valuable than gold,
* that real faith is a treasure that is worth much more than gold,
* That is worth far more than gold,

**more precious than gold:** The phrase *more precious than gold* indicates that God greatly valued the fact that the believers genuinely trusted him. Their faith was worth more than any amount of gold or any worldly treasure. Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> which is more valuable than gold (NET)

**gold:** The word *gold* refers to a very valuable metal that is strong and beautiful. It lasts a long time. If *gold* is not known in your area, you may need to use a general expression to describe it. For example:

> expensive/valuable metal

#### 1:7c

**which perishes even though refined by fire—**

* which people test by fire even though it is impermanent.
* which is temporary, though people still put it in fire to test it.

**which perishes even though refined by fire:** The phrase *which perishes even though refined by fire* implies two facts:

1. People test gold for purity by putting it in a very hot fire. (The fire melts the gold so that they can remove the impurities.)
2. They do this work even though gold is perishable (will not last for ever).

Other ways to say this are:

> gold is perishable, yet/but men test it by fire

> even though gold will perish, people test it for purity by fire

**perishes:** The Greek words that the BSB translates as *perishes* here implies that gold is only a material object and will not last for ever. It is temporary and will someday be destroyed. This is in contrast to genuine faith, which will last even after Jesus Christ is revealed. Some other ways to translate *perishes* are:

> that can be destroyed (CEV)

> will be ruined

> that will not last for ever

**refined by fire:** People used a very hot *fire* to heat gold. They would melt it to test it and see if it was pure. If gold is pure, when it is melted no impurities will float to the top. Our faith is compared to gold. Both must be tested to be sure they are without impurities. Some other ways to translate this clause are:

> made pure by heating it with fire

> shown to be only gold, nothing else, by testing it with very hot fire

> proved to be free of anything else by heating it with extremely hot fire

#### 1:7d

**may result in praise, glory, and honor**

* The trials will cause your faith to bring you praise, glory, and honour
* You will be praised, honoured, and exalted for this proof of your faith
* God will praise, honour, and glorify you for being faithful through these trials

**may result in praise, glory, and honor:** The phrase *may result in praise, glory, and honor* is literally “may be found unto praise and glory and honor.” Their genuine faith will cause God to praise, glorify, and give honor to them. The verb “found” expresses result. Other ways to say this are:

> may redound to praise and glory and honor (RSV)

> will bring praise, glory, and honor (NET)

**praise, glory, and honor:** These words express actions. In some languages it may be necessary to specify who gives and receives the *praise, glory, and honor*. The most likely interpretation is that God will give *praise, glory, and honor* to believers.(GW) has the praise being given to God. These Notes do not address the issue raised by Abernathy, pages 22–23, “to whom or what is ‘praise, glory, and honor’ directed?” The author found almost no commentary support for this position, i.e. that it is directed toward God/Christ. If a language requires that an indirect object be supplied, then “to you” is probably best. He will praise them, glorify them, and honor them (which they will, in turn, give back to God). In some languages it may be necessary to make either the receiver or both giver and receiver explicit. For example:

> Then you will receive praise, glory, and honor (GNT)

> and so \[because you truly trust him] God will give you praise, glory, and honor

> Then God will praise, honor, and glorify you

The words *praise*, *glory*, and *honor* are similar in meaning.

**praise:** In this context *praise* implies that God will express his approval of the believers. He will speak well of them.

> God will praise you

**glory:** In this context the Greek word that the BSB translates as *glory* is similar in meaning to “honor” or “praise.” Some other ways to say this are:

> make high

> God will exalt you

**honor:** In this context *honor* indicates that God will treat believers as valuable and worthy to be respected. Some other ways to translate this word include:

> make famous

> cause to be respected

#### 1:7e

**at the revelation of Jesus Christ.**

* on the day when Jesus Christ appears again.
* at the time when Jesus Christ will reveal himself to the whole world.
* when Jesus Christ returns and reveals himself to all people.

**at the revelation of Jesus Christ:** The phrase *at the revelation of Jesus Christ* means “when Jesus Christ is revealed.” This refers to the time when Jesus Christ will return to the world and reveal (show) himself to people.Some scholars interpret “revelation” as a passive idea with God as the agent. This would result in a rendering such as “when God reveals Jesus Christ.” At that time everyone will see him and know who he is. Other ways to say this are:

> when Jesus Christ appears again (GW)

> when Jesus Christ reveals himself to everyone

> when Jesus Christ shows people who he is

##### **General Comments on 1:7**

The BSB translates this verse and verse 6 as one long sentence. In some languages it may be helpful to use more sentences to express the ideas. For example:

> The purpose of these trials is that your faith might be proved genuine. And your genuine faith is more precious than gold. For even though men test gold with fire, the gold will eventually perish. But your faith will bring you praise and glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.

In some languages it may be more natural to reorder the information in this verse. There are different ways to do this. For example:

> 7a God has allowed these trials so that when your faith is proved genuine 7dhe may give you praise, glory, and honor. 7eThis will happen on the day when Jesus Christ is revealed. 7cGold is tested by fire, even though it will perish. 7bAnd your genuine/tested faith is more valuable than gold.

> 7a These trials are testing your faith in order to prove that it is genuine. 7cIn a similar way, people use fire to test gold, even though gold is perishable. 7bGenuine faith is more precious than gold. 7dIt will bring you praise, glory, and honor 7ewhen Christ appears on earth.

## 1 Peter 1:8 (id: 474494)

### Section 1:3–12: Peter praised God for the great hope that he has given us

In this section, Peter praised God for the new life that his readers had received because Jesus Christ rose from the dead. He also praised God for the good things that God has made ready for his people in heaven (1:3–5\). These blessings from God cause believers to rejoice, even in times of trouble. They have joy because they know that God is saving their souls (1:6–9\). In the final paragraph, Peter reminded his readers of how the Old Testament prophets had earlier prophesied about this salvation. They had foretold that Christ would suffer in order to save people (1:10–12\).

Some other headings for this section are:

> The hope of eternal life (NLT)

> Faith in Christ brings you joy (NET)

> A real reason for hope (CEV)

#### 1:8a

**Though you have not seen Him, you love Him;**

* Although you have not seen him, you love him;
* You have never seen Jesus Christ, but nevertheless you love him.
* You love Jesus Christ without ever seeing him.

**Though you have not seen Him, you love Him:** The Christians to whom Peter wrote this letter had not seen Jesus when he was on earth. However, they loved him. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Other ways to translate it are:

> You have not seen Christ, but still you love him. (NCV)

> You love Jesus Christ although you have not seen him.

**Him:** *Him* refers to Jesus Christ. In some languages it may be more natural to repeat his name here. For example:

> You have not seen Jesus Christ

In this letter, Peter does not use the name “Jesus” without “Christ.” He also does not use only “Christ” until 1:11, where he refers to Christ before he became a human being. Therefore, if you make his name explicit here, it is best to say “Jesus Christ.”

**love:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *love* means that a person values and reveres Jesus Christ (and God) with gratitude and affection. He is devoted and loyal to Christ. Use a natural expression or idiom for this word.

#### 1:8b

**and though you do not see Him now, you believe in Him**

* and even though you are not seeing him now, you trust in him.
* You cannot see him now, but you trust him.

**and though you do not see Him now, you believe in Him:** This verse part is similar in meaning to 1:8a. The believers were trusting Jesus Christ without being able to see him. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Other ways to translate it are:

> You do not see him now, but still you believe in him.

> You believe in Jesus Christ, even though you do not see him now.

**believe in Him:** To *believe in* Jesus means to “entrust oneself” to Jesus, that is, “to place oneself in the complete care” of Jesus. Some other ways to translate this are:

> rely/depend on

> trust in

> trust in and commit to

> have confidence in

Your language may use an idiom for this meaning.

##### **General Comment on 1:8a–b**

The statements in 1:8a and 1:8b are similar. In some languages it may be helpful to translate each statement in a parallel way. For example:

> You have never seen Jesus Christ, yet you love him.

> You do not see him now, yet you believe in him.

In some languages it may be more natural to put the two negative and the two positive statements in 1:8a–b together. For example, the CEV says:

> You have never seen Jesus, and you don’t see him now. But still you love him and have faith in him… (CEV)

#### 1:8c

**and rejoice with an inexpressible and glorious joy,**

* As a result, you are rejoicing greatly, with a joy that you cannot describe because it is so magnificent.
* Because you trust him, you feel a joy so wonderful that you do not have words to describe/express it.

**and:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *and* introduces what happens as a result of 1:8a–b. The NET says:

> and so…

**rejoice with an inexpressible and glorious joy:** In Greek, this part of the verse is literally, “you rejoice with joy inexpressible and glorious.” This phrase emphasizes the great joy that the believers feel. They are so joyful that they are not able to describe it. Use a natural way to express this emphasis in your language. Here are some ways to say this:

> you are wonderfully happy, more than you can express

> no words can tell how glad and happy you are (CEV)

> You are extremely happy with joy and praise that can hardly be expressed in words (GW)

**inexpressible:** The Greek word that the BSB translate as *inexpressible* occurs only here in the New Testament. Peter meant that the joy was so great and wonderful that no one could describe it adequately in words. Other ways to say this include:

> indescribable (NET)

> cannot be described (NJB)

> which words cannot express (GNT)

**glorious:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *glorious* is literally “having been glorified/exalted.” This is a passive verbal form. The joy was a special kind of joy that came from their faith in Jesus. If you have an expression that describes joy that comes from something wonderful or magnificent, you may be able to use it here.About this joy, Grudem says, “The sense of this word exalted (a perfect passive participle) could be given more fully by paraphrasing, ‘joy that has been infused with heavenly glory and that still possesses the radiance of that glory.’ It is thus joy that results from being in the presence of God himself, and joy that even now partakes of the character of heaven. It is the joy of heaven before heaven, experienced now in fellowship with the unseen Christ.” Davids says, “The joy is also “filled with glory,” a joy that has already been glorified, not in the sense that they already experience the fullness of glory of the coming of Christ, but in the sense that in their love and commitment to Christ they experience a joy that partakes of and anticipates the joy of the final day of salvation. It is in their focus on Christ, rather than on circumstances or even on doctrine, that they find this joy.” Other ways to say this are:

> full of glory (NCV)

> exalted (RSV)

### Section 1:3–12: Peter praised God for the great hope that he has given us

In this section, Peter praised God for the new life that his readers had received because Jesus Christ rose from the dead. He also praised God for the good things that God has made ready for his people in heaven (1:3–5\). These blessings from God cause believers to rejoice, even in times of trouble. They have joy because they know that God is saving their souls (1:6–9\). In the final paragraph, Peter reminded his readers of how the Old Testament prophets had earlier prophesied about this salvation. They had foretold that Christ would suffer in order to save people (1:10–12\).

Some other headings for this section are:

> The hope of eternal life (NLT)

> Faith in Christ brings you joy (NET)

> A real reason for hope (CEV)

#### 1:9

**now that you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls.**

* You rejoice like this, because you are obtaining the salvation of your souls, which is your goal/purpose in trusting in Jesus Christ.
* You are joyful because you know that God is saving you, as you are trusting him to do.
* You are so happy, because you trust in Jesus Christ in order for God to save you, and you know that he is saving you.

**now that you are receiving…salvation:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *now that you are receiving…salvation* is literally “receiving…salvation.” There are two ways to interpret the connection between this phrase and 1:8c:

1. The believers were rejoicing because they were receiving salvation. For example:

    > because you are receiving…salvation (GNT) *(BSB, CEV, NET, NIV, NRSV, GNT)*

2. The believers were rejoicing and at the same time they were receiving salvation. For example:

    > And you are receiving…salvation (NCV) *(NJB, NLT, RSV, REB, NCV)*

The KJV reads simply “receiving,” and the NASB “obtaining,” which can be understood either way. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).

**are receiving:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *are receiving* often refers to obtaining something as a reward or prize.Davids. Other ways to say this are:

> obtain(ing) (GW, NASB, RSV)

> attaining (NET)

If you have a natural way in your language to speak of people *receiving* what is due to them, then you may be able to use it here.Most scholars believe that this verse refers to a salvation that believers were already experiencing and which they would increasingly experience until the time when they experienced it fully at Jesus Christ’s return. This view is followed by BSB, CEV, GW, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, NRSV, REB, and GNT. However, some scholars believe that it refers exclusively to the future salvation either in heaven or when he returns. (See the NLT and NJB.)

**the goal of your faith:** There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as *goal* in this context:

1. It refers to the goal or purpose of the believers’ faith. They believed in Jesus in order to be saved. For example:

    > the goal of your faith (GW) *(BSB, CEV, NCV, NET, NIV, NJB, GNT, GW)*

2. It refers to the result of the believers’ faith. They believed in Jesus and as a result, they were saved. For example:

    > the outcome of your faith (RSV) *(NASB, NLT, REB, RSV, KJV, JBP)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\) and the majority of English versions.

**your faith:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *faith* refers to believing and trusting Jesus Christ. If it is necessary for you to translate it as a verb, it may be possible to say something like:

> you are trusting Jesus Christ so that you may receive your salvation

**the salvation of your souls:** The phrase *the salvation of your souls* refers to being saved by Jesus Christ from sin and eternal death. Peter’s readers trusted in Jesus Christ as their Savior, and he was saving them at that very time. They would be finally saved from all sin at the last day.

**salvation:** Peter used this same word in 1:5b. There he spoke of the time when God will save his people in the future. Here he writes that God is already saving his people at the present time.Other places in this letter where Peter uses a form of the Greek word that the BSB translates here as “salvation” are 1:5, 1:10, 2:2\.

**souls:** In this context the Greek word that the BSB translates as *souls* refers to the believers themselves. It does not refer only to their spirits. In some languages it may be best to use a word like “you” or “your.” For example:

> your salvation

> is saving you

### Section 1:3–12: Peter praised God for the great hope that he has given us

In this section, Peter praised God for the new life that his readers had received because Jesus Christ rose from the dead. He also praised God for the good things that God has made ready for his people in heaven (1:3–5\). These blessings from God cause believers to rejoice, even in times of trouble.

### Paragraph 1:10–12

Peter told his readers that they were privileged because they had heard the gospel. Peter’s readers understood the good news about how God saves people more clearly than did the prophets who lived before them. Peter’s readers were also privileged in that as Christians they knew from experience what it is like to have God save them. Even the angels do not know this.

#### 1:10a

**Concerning this salvation, the prophets who foretold the grace to come to you**

* ¶ Concerning this salvation, long ago the prophets told that God would be kind to you.
* ¶ God’s prophets foretold that God would save people. Long ago they prophesied that God would be kind to you.

In many languages it may be best to make 1:10a a separate sentence. For example:

> As for this salvation, the prophets foretold how God was going to be gracious to you.

See also the Display for 1:10a for additional examples.

See the General Comment on 1:10–11 at the end of 1:11c for an example of how you may be able to make your translation clearer and more natural by combining 1:10–11\.

**Concerning this salvation:** The phrase *Concerning this salvation* introduces the topic of this paragraph. In this paragraph Peter wrote more *Concerning* the *salvation* that he had just mentioned (1:9\). Some other ways to translate this phrase include:

> This salvation was (NLT)

> It was about this salvation

> Now I want to talk about this salvation

**the prophets who foretold the grace:** Hundreds of years earlier, and over a long period of time, God’s *prophets* had foretold that God would send the Messiah/Christ to save people.

**prophets:** The *prophets* were men and women who spoke on behalf of God. They told people what God revealed to them. God gave some prophets power to work miracles. These miracles helped people realize that God had sent the prophets. Some ways to translate *prophets* are:

> spokesmen for God

> people who speak God’s words

> God’s message\-speakers

**foretold:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *foretold* is more literally “prophesied.” The prophets told the messages God had given them concerning events that were then in the distant future. Other ways to say this are:

> prophesied (GNT)

> predicted (NET)

**the grace:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *grace* means “kindness, favor.” In this context it refers to the salvation the prophets foretold that God in his kindness would provide. Other ways this has been translated include:

> God’s kindness (GW)

> this gracious salvation (NLT)

> this gift (GNT)

**to come:** The BSB has supplied the words *to come*. These words are not in the Greek text. If your translation already makes it clear that the message is about the future (see notes above for “spoke”), you do not need to supply these words here.

**to you:** Peter wrote *to you* in order to make his letter personal. By the phrase *to you*, Peter did not mean that this grace/salvation was not for him too. If in your language *to you* implies that the grace/salvation did not extend to Peter (and other Christians), you may want to instead say:

> to/for us

#### 1:10b

**searched and investigated carefully,**

* They intently made a careful search of the prophecies,
* They studied the prophecies very carefully,
* They thoroughly researched and investigated the Scriptures/Holy Writings.

**searched and investigated carefully:** The Greek text that the BSB translates as *searched and investigated carefully* has two verbs. These Greek verbs are similar in meaning. Because they are so similar, you may:

* Translate them together as one phrase.Translating the two verbs as one would make sense if Peter’s reason for using used two words was to intensify one thought. That may be the case, but opinions vary. The characteristics of the receptor language will usually dictate the best way to translate these two similar verbs for that language. For example:

    > This salvation was the subject of intense search by the prophets (REB)

* Translate them separately as two verbs. For example:

    > carefully researched and investigated (GW)

    > inquired and searched diligently (KJV)

Translate these two verbs in the way that is most natural in your language. Your translation should communicate that the prophets investigated the matter thoroughly.

**searched:** In some languages it may be necessary to say what the prophets *searched* and *investigated*. In those languages, you may need to supply the implied information that they searched the Old Testament Scriptures. For example:

> searched the prophecies

> investigated the Scriptures/ Writings

> studied thoroughly the Jewish Holy Writings

In this section, Peter praised God for the new life that his readers had received because Jesus Christ rose from the dead. He also praised God for the good things that God has made ready for his people in heaven (1:3–5\). These blessings from God cause believers to rejoice, even in times of trouble.

### Paragraph 1:10–12

Peter told his readers that they were privileged because they had heard the gospel. Peter’s readers understood the good news about how God saves people more clearly than did the prophets who lived before them. Peter’s readers were also privileged in that as Christians they knew from experience what it is like to have God save them. Even the angels do not know this.

#### 1:11

Long before Peter wrote this letter, the Holy Spirit revealed to the prophets of the Old Testament what would happen to the Christ, God’s Son. The Holy Spirit revealed that he would suffer and then receive glory from God his Father.

#### 1:11a

**trying to determine the time and setting**

* trying to discover when and under what circumstances
* because they wanted to know when and how
* They looked for when these prophecies would happen and what things would be like at that time.

**trying to determine the time and setting:** There are two ways of interpreting the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *time and setting*:

1. It means what time and what circumstances. For example:

    > \[The prophets] tried to learn…when those things would happen, and what the world would be like at that time. (NCV) *(BSB, GW, KJV, NIV, NJB, REB, GNT, NCV)*

2. It means what person and what time. For example:

    > they searched to find out exactly who Christ would be and when this would happen. (CEV) *(NASB, NET, NLT, RSV, CEV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). However, since scholars are uncertain about this and either meaning is possible, you may wish to follow the major\-language version in your area.

**and:** There are two ways of interpreting the Greek word that the BSB translates as *and*:

1. It means *and*. *(BSB, CEV, NCV, NIV, NJB, NLT, REB, GNT)*
2. It means or. *(GW, KJV, NASB, NET, RSV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\) since in this context it is clear that the prophets were searching for both the time and the circumstances.

#### 1:11b

**to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing**

* the events would happen which the Spirit of Christ had directed them to say/prophesy.
* Christ had sent the Holy Spirit to give these prophets messages, to tell people

**the Spirit of Christ:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *the Spirit of Christ* refers to the Holy Spirit. It does not refer to Jesus’ human spirit, but the Holy Spirit sent from Jesus.

If your readers would understand the phrase *the Spirit of Christ* to refer to Christ’s own spirit, then you may need to say something like:

> the Holy Spirit sent by Christ

See also John 16:7, where Jesus explained to his disciples that, after he went to His Father, he would send the Holy Spirit.

**Christ:** These notes and the meaning lines in the Display follow the interpretation that Peter used *Christ* as a name rather than a title (see the note on “Christ” at 1:1a).

**in them:** The phrase *in them* implies that the Holy Spirit was controlling the words of these prophets. The prophets were speaking, but the Holy Spirit was causing them to speak and telling them what to say. If saying that the Spirit of Christ was *in them* is unnatural in your language, or communicates a wrong meaning, you may be able to say:

> who directed them to speak/prophesy

> who told/gave them what to write/say

> who inspired their writings

**was pointing:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *was pointing* in this context means to reveal or make something known. The verb is in the imperfect tense, showing that the Spirit continued doing this again and again. The GW therefore translates this as:

> kept referring to (GW)

Other ways to translate this verb include:

> was indicating (NASB, NET)

> was showing (NCV)

#### 1:11c

**when He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow.**

* He told them in advance that Christ would suffer much and afterwards receive glory.
* ahead of time that Christ would suffer greatly and afterwards be glorified/honoured.

**when He predicted:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *predicted* means to tell about something before it happens. In contrast, the English word “predict” can mean to say something about the future that does not in fact ever happen. Be sure that your translation follows the meaning of the Greek. What the Holy Spirit told the prophets was sure to happen. Other ways to say this include:

> told them in advance (NLT)

> foretold (REB)

**the sufferings of Christ:** The phrase *the sufferings of Christ* means “how Christ would suffer.” It implies that his suffering would result in death. When the Holy Spirit told the prophets about how Christ would suffer and die, it was still in the future. Christ was not born until several hundred years later. Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> how Christ would suffer (CEV)

**and the glories to follow:** The phrase *and the glories to follow* means “how Christ would receive glory after he had suffered and died.”

**glories:** The Greek text reads *glories*, in the plural. Peter was perhaps referring to a series of events, including Christ’s resurrection and ascension into heaven. But in some languages the plural of the word “glory” may be unnatural or may not exist at all. If this is the case in your language, it may be necessary to use the singular word “glory” (as in the NLT and several other English versions). Some other ways to translate this word are:

> glorious events

> wonderful things that would happen

If your language does not normally use abstract nouns such as *glories*, then you may want to use a verb, such as:

> glorified

> honored

If it is necessary in your language to say who would glorify Jesus Christ, then you should supply the subject “God”:

> how God would honor/glorify him

See also the note on “glory” at 1:7d.

##### **General Comment on 1:10–11**

You may be able to make your translation of verses 10–11 clearer and more natural by reordering the verse parts. This is one suggestion:

> 10a Long ago God’s prophets foretold that God would be kind to you and save you. 11b Christ had sent the Holy Spirit to give these prophets messages to tell people 11cahead of time that Christ was going to suffer and afterwards be glorified/honored. 10bThe prophets thoroughly researched and investigated the Scriptures, because they wanted 11ato discover when and under what circumstances these prophecies would be fulfilled.

### Section 1:3–12: Peter praised God for the great hope that he has given us

In this section, Peter praised God for the new life that his readers had received because Jesus Christ rose from the dead. He also praised God for the good things that God has made ready for his people in heaven (1:3–5\). These blessings from God cause believers to rejoice, even in times of trouble. They have joy because they know that God is saving their souls (1:6–9\). In the final paragraph, Peter reminded his readers of how the Old Testament prophets had earlier prophesied about this salvation.

Some other headings for this section are:

### Paragraph 1:10–12

Peter told his readers that they were privileged because they had heard the gospel. Peter’s readers understood the good news about how God saves people more clearly than did the prophets who lived before them. Peter’s readers were also privileged in that as Christians they knew from experience what it is like to have God save them. Even the angels do not know this.

#### 1:12a

**It was revealed to them**

* The Holy Spirit also showed/told them
* However, the Holy Spirit caused the prophets to know

God caused the prophets to understand that their prophecies about Christ suffering and then receiving glory would not be fulfilled in their lifetime. Instead, future generations, after Jesus Christ’s ministry on earth, would benefit from knowing how God had fulfilled these prophecies through Jesus Christ. Peter wrote this letter at a time when many of these prophecies had been fulfilled and his readers had been taught to what events these prophecies referred.

**It was revealed to them:** This is a passive verb that does not specify who did the action. Your language may require you to say who *revealed* this *to* the prophets. In this paragraph, Peter mentioned the Holy Spirit twice as the agent sent from heaven. Here is a way you could translate this phrase:

> The Holy Spirit revealed to them

Here is another way to translate it:

> God revealed to them

**revealed:** In this context the Greek verb that the BSB translates as *revealed* means “told” or “made known.” The prophets did not actually see their prophecies about Christ fulfilled. You may be able to translate this as:

> enabled the prophets to understand

In 1:11b, Peter wrote about the Holy Spirit communicating with the prophets. If you use a verb here in 1:12 that is similar to the verb you used in 1:11, then you may want to add “also” in 1:12\. For example:

> The Holy Spirit also told them

#### 1:12b

**that they were not serving themselves, but you, when they foretold the things**

* that they spoke these prophetic messages not for their own benefit, but for yours.
* that they were announcing these prophetic messages concerning Christ so that you would understand how he fulfilled them, not so that they could understand.

**they were not serving themselves, but you:** The phrase *they were not serving themselves, but you* means “the prophets were not helping/benefitting themselves but they were helping/benefitting you, my readers.” God did not give these prophecies to the prophets in order for the prophets to know exactly when they would be fulfilled. Instead, by telling the prophecies, the prophets benefitted people who lived much later, including Peter’s readers. At the time when Peter wrote this letter, his readers could know when and how God had made the prophecies concerning Jesus Christ happen. Another way to say this is:

> not for their own benefit, but for yours (GNT)

**they:** The pronoun *they* refers to the Old Testament prophets who prophesied about Jesus Christ.

**when they foretold:** The BSB has supplied the words *when they foretold* in order to make the translation clearer and more natural English. The Greek text does not contain these words. Several other English translations contain similar phrases. For example:

> delivering the message (NJB)

> when they told (NCV)

**the things:** The phrase *the things* refers to the sufferings and glory of Christ mentioned in 1:11c.

#### 1:12c

**now announced by those who preached the gospel to you**

* The men who preached the gospel to you told you these things
* Now you have heard these prophecies. The evangelists told them to you

**now announced by those who preached the gospel to you:** By the time Peter wrote this letter, these prophecies concerning Christ had been fulfilled. Christian teachers had *announced* these prophecies to people, including Peter’s readers, telling them how Jesus Christ had fulfilled the prophecies.

The verb *announced* is in the passive. In some languages it may be necessary to use an active verb:

> that those who preached the gospel to you told you…

> that the evangelists announced/declared to you….

**now:** In this verse, *now* refers to the time when Peter lived. Peter’s readers had heard the prophecies about Jesus Christ as Savior, and they had heard that these prophecies had been fulfilled.

**announced:** The Greek says literally “announced to you.” The BSB omits the phrase “to you” for brevity, but it may be necessary in your language to specify to whom something was announced. If so, you can say “to you” (plural). The verb that the BSB translates as *announced* is very general in meaning. Its basic meaning is to provide information. Other ways that you may be able to translate this Greek verb include:

> reported (KJV)

> informed

> proclaimed

**by those who preached the gospel to you:** Peter identified the means by which his readers heard about the prophecies and how Jesus Christ had fulfilled them. They heard it from *those*, which refers to the people who had *preached the gospel to* them.

**preached the gospel:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *preached the gospel* can also be translated as:

> announced the Good News (GNT)

> spread the Good News (GW)

> brought…good news (NRSV)

**the gospel:** The examples above show that *the gospel* means the good news. If your language requires you to state the content of the good news, what the good news is about, then you may be able to say:

> the good news about Jesus Christ

> the good news about God saving people/you

#### 1:12d

**by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven.**

* through the power of the Holy Spirit sent from heaven.
* with the help of the Holy Spirit whom God/Christ sent.

**by the Holy Spirit:** The phrase *by the Holy Spirit* means “under the Holy Spirit’s direction/leading” or “with the Holy Spirit’s power.” Various ways of translating this include:

> by the power of the Holy Spirit (GNT)

> in the power of the Holy Spirit (REB)

> with the help of the Holy Spirit (NCV)

**the Holy Spirit sent from heaven:** The *Holy Spirit* is the same as the Spirit of Christ mentioned in 1:2b.

**sent from heaven:** The phrase *sent from heaven* is passive. Peter does not say who sent the Holy Spirit, God or Christ. If your language requires you to specify who sent the Holy Spirit, you may supply either subject. If you have mentioned Christ as the one who sent the Spirit in 1:11b, then you may wish to repeat this. Otherwise, you may say:

> by the Holy Spirit whom God sent from heaven

**heaven:** The word *heaven* is the name of the dwelling place of God. Saying *sent from heaven* is another way of saying “sent from God.” In some languages it may not be necessary to mention God and heaven separately and explicitly. See how you translated *heaven* in 1:4c.

#### 1:12e

**Even angels long to look into these things.**

* Even the angels are very interested in these things concerning our(incl) salvation.
* Even the holy angels greatly desire to comprehend God’s plan to save us(incl).
* These events/things that God has done to save us(incl) are so remarkable/wonderful that even God’s holy angels are intrigued/fascinated by them.

**Even angels long to look into these things:** The *angels* do not need to be saved from sin and death. Even so, they want to understand God’s plan to save human beings. They are very interested in what God has done to deliver his people.

**Even:** The BSB has supplied the word *Even*. It is not explicit in the Greek text. However, it does express the emphasis here, and many other translations also supply this word, as you may wish to do as well.

**angels:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *angels* here refers to the good spirit beings who serve God. It does not refer to the demons, the fallen *angels* who follow Satan. If just saying *angels* in your translation could be misunderstood to include demons, then you may need to make it clear which angels Peter was referring to. For example:

> the holy/good angels.

> God’s holy angels.

**long:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *long* means “are strongly desiring.” Some other ways to translates this are:

> eagerly (NLT)

> greatly desire

**to look into:** The Greek verb that the BSB translates literally as *look* here means to try to “understand” or “comprehend” something. Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> know more about (CEV)

**these things:** The phrase *these things* refers to the sufferings of Jesus the Messiah in his crucifixion and the glory of his resurrection. If a literal translation of *things* would refer to material objects, you may be able to say instead:

> these events

> these facts

## 1 Peter 1:13 (id: 474499)

### Section 1:13–25: God wants believers to live holy lives

In this section Peter urged his readers to live holy lives (vv. 13–16\). Christ had paid a great price to save them (vv. 17–21\) and had given them new life (vv. 23–25\). In response to God’s kindness they should love one another (1:22\).

Some other headings for this section are:

> Live Holy Lives (GW)

> Chosen To Live a Holy Life (CEV)

#### 1:13a

**Therefore prepare your minds for action.**

* ¶ Therefore, get your minds ready to act,
* ¶ So prepare your thinking to do what is right.

**Therefore:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Therefore* introduces Peter’s words of practical teaching based on what he had just written in the preceding section. In this new section, Peter began to tell his readers how to think and act. Other ways you might be able to say this include:

> So then (GNT)

> Because of all that God has done for you

**prepare your minds for action:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *prepare your minds for action* is literally “tie up the waist/loins of your(plur) mind.” This is a metaphor. In Peter’s time, men as well as women usually wore long robes. When they prepared to do hard work, the men pulled their robe up and tied it at their waist with a rope or belt. They were then ready *for action*.

Peter applied this metaphor to his readers’ *minds*. He was telling them to be mentally ready *for action*.

There are various ways to translate this. For example:

* Keep all of the metaphor:

    > gird up the loins of your mind (KJV)

* Keep part of the metaphor:

    > gird up your minds (RSV)

* Give the meaning without the metaphor:

    > Your minds…must be…ready for action (NJB)

    > prepare your minds for action (NASB)

    > be alert (CEV)

Use the form that is the most clear and natural in your language.

**for action:** The phrase *for action* is not in the Greek text. Because the metaphor Peter used is not natural or understood in modern English, the BSB and some other versions have supplied the words *for action* to make the meaning of this metaphor clear.

#### 1:13b

**Be sober\-minded.**

* and think clearly.
* Keep alert. (GNT)

**Be sober\-minded:** The Greek word that the BSB translates here as *Be sober\-minded* is literally “be sober.” Since the context refers to the mind, Peter is probably not telling his readers here not to get physically drunk. Rather, this is a metaphor. Peter wanted his readers to think clearly and be alert and in control of their thoughts and actions. Some ways this may be translated are:

> your minds must be clear (GW)

> you must control your thoughts

A few translations understand the word “fully” to apply to “sober” rather than to “hope.” For example:

> with minds that are alert and fully sober (NIV)

#### 1:13c

**Set your hope fully on the grace to be given you**

* Put your hope fully/totally on the good things that God will give you
* Have complete confidence in what God, because of his kindness, will bring for you
* Confidently look forward to the blessings that you will receive

**Set your hope fully on the grace to be given you:** Peter told his readers to trust *fully* in God’s kindness towards them. Because of his kindness, God saved them. Peter wanted his readers to be completely confident that they would receive everything good associated with God saving them.

**Set your hope:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Set your hope* is literally the command “hope.” Other ways of translating this include:

> put…your hope (CEV, NJB)

> Place your confidence (GW)

> Look forward to (NLT)

**fully:** The Greek adverb that the BSB translates as *fully* means “completely.” In some languages it may be natural to translate it as an adjective:

> put your full hope

**on the grace to be given you:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *to be given you* is literally “being brought to you.” This is a passive clause. If it is more natural in your language to use an active verb, you may be able to use one of these models:

> in what God’s kindness will bring you… (GW)

> to the special blessings that will come to you… (NLT)

**grace:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *grace* means “kindness, goodwill.” Here it refers to all the good things that God is going to give believers on the last day. These include all the blessings of the inheritance that God is keeping for them in heaven (1:4a–b), including eternal life and freedom from sin. This *grace* also includes the praise, glory and honor *to be given* to them by God (1:7d). See the note on the word *grace* at 1:10a. Some other ways to translate this are:

> God’s kind/gracious help

> God’s loving kindness

#### 1:13d

**at the revelation of Jesus Christ.**

* when Jesus Christ will return and show himself.
* when Jesus Christ appears again.
* when Jesus Christ returns for people/everyone will see him.

**at the revelation of Jesus Christ:** Peter used this phrase at 1:7e also. The meaning here is the same as it was at 1:7\. *Jesus Christ* will return to this world on the last day. He will reveal himself to people everywhere in the world. Everyone will be able to see him. You may be able to translate this as:

> when Jesus Christ reveals himself (JBP)

> when Jesus Christ appears again (GW)

> when Jesus Christ will return for everyone to see

### Section 1:13–25: God wants believers to live holy lives

In this section Peter urged his readers to live holy lives (vv. 13–16\). Christ had paid a great price to save them (vv. 17–21\) and had given them new life (vv. 23–25\). In response to God’s kindness they should love one another (1:22\).

Some other headings for this section are:

> Live Holy Lives (GW)

> Chosen To Live a Holy Life (CEV)

#### 1:14a

**As obedient children,**

* Since you are God’s obedient children,
* Since you are God’s sons and daughters and obey him as your Father,

**As obedient children:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *As obedient children* is literally “as children of obedience.” There are two ways of understanding the way in which this phrase functions in this verse:

1. It is the grounds for what Peter tells the believers to do. The meaning is that they are obedient. The English versions that use “as” are following this interpretation. *One translation that makes this interpretation explicit is GW, which says:*

    > Because you are children who obey God, don’t live (GW) *(BSB, GW, NCV, NIV, RSV, KJV, NASB, NJB, JBP, NET)*

2. It describes what the believers’ behavior should be like. For example:

    > Behave like obedient children (CEV) *(NRSV, NLT, REB, GNT, CEV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\) as the majority of versions listed do.

Another way to say this is:

> Since you are God’s obedient children

**children:** Peter called his readers *children*. This means that they were sons and daughters of God. God calls Christians his *children*, his sons and daughters, whether they are young or old (see John 1:12\). If it is unnatural in your language to use the word *children* in this way, you may instead be able to refer to Christians as having God as their Father. For example:

> Since you obey God as your Father

> Since you are God’s obedient sons and daughters

#### 1:14b

**do not conform to the passions of your former ignorance.**

* do not pattern/model your lives after the evil desires you felt when you lived in ignorance of God.
* do not allow your desires to lead you to sin as you did before you knew God.
* do not do the wrong things you desired to do when you did not know God.

**do not conform to the passions of your former ignorance:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *do not conform to* means “do not mold/pattern your lives after.” This verb is also found in Romans 12:2\. Because Peter’s readers had become children of God, they were no longer to gratify their *passions* as they formerly did. Some other ways to translate this include:

> do not allow your lives to be shaped by those desires you had (GNT)

> Don’t let your lives be controlled by your desires (CEV)

**the passions of your former ignorance:** Of the English versions found in Translator’s Workplace, only the NLT has made the Greek word *epithumiais* implicit. Other versions have translated *epithumiais* as desires/lusts/passions/urges. The Greek word that the BSB translates as *passions* is simply “desires.” This word generally implied wrong or selfish desires. The NIV has made this explicit:

> the evil desires

If your language has a word or phrase that describes human desire to do something that is against God’s will, you could use it here. You do not necessarily need to include the word “*evil.”* For example, for “the passions” you could say:

> the lusts

> your lusts

**of your former ignorance:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *your former ignorance* refers to the time before Peter’s readers believed in Christ. At that time they were ignorant of God and his ways and his salvation. This phrase does not imply that Peter’s readers were uneducated or unintelligent people. Some other ways to translate this phrase are:

> when you did not know any better

> when you were unaware of God’s truth

#### 1:15a

**But just as He who called you is holy,**

* But because God who called you is holy,
* But since God who called you to be his children is completely good,

**But:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *But* is a conjunction that indicates contrast. In this case, the contrast is between what Peter told his readers not to do in 1:14 and what he told them to do here in this verse. Indicate this contrast in a way that is natural in your language. For example:

> Instead (GNT)

**just as He who called you is holy:** There are two ways of interpreting the role or function of the Greek word that the BSB translates as *holy*:

1. It is an adjective describing God. The quality of holiness is attributed to him. For example:

    > as he who called you is holy (RSV) *(BSB, GNT, GW, NIV, KJV, NCV, NLT, REB, RSV, CEV, JBP)*

2. It is a title for God and functions as a noun: the Holy One. For example:

    > like the Holy One who called you (NASB) *(NET, NJB, NASB)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\) and the majority of English versions.

**just as:** The NASB, NET, and NJB reflect an alternative interpretation in which the phrase *who called you* modifies “the Holy One”: “like the Holy One who called you.” The Greek word that the BSB translates as *just as* here means “in the same way that.” Here is another way to translate this:

> like (NET)

**He who called you:** The phrase *He who called you* refers to God. In some languages it may be necessary to make that explicit. For example:

> just as God who called you is holy (GNT)

**called:** The Greek verb that the BSB translates as *called* refers to God’s invitation to Peter’s readers to be in a relationship with him. In some languages it may be necessary to say what God called these people to do. For example:

> called you to be his people

> chose you to be his children

“To be his children” is a good choice in this context, since in 1:14 Peter spoke of his readers as obedient children of God.

**holy:** In this context, the word *holy* refers to fully serving God. It also refers to living a good, morally pure life. (It also means “to be pure” and “free from sin.”) Some other examples for translating are:

> dedicated to God

> fully serving God

> morally pure

> morally upright

#### 1:15b

**so be holy in all you do,**

* you should be holy in everything you do.
* you also should be holy in all your conduct.
* your behavior should be completely good too.

**so:** This verse part starts with the common Greek conjunction that normally means “and.” The BSB has translated it as “so.” Some English versions do not translate this conjunction in this context. Translate this conjunction in a way that is natural in your language to link 1:15b with 1:15a. Another way to translate it is:

> also (NASB)

**be holy in all you do:** The Greek text here contains a word that the BSB has left implicit. This word could be literally translated as “yourselves,” as in “be holy yourselves in all….” Its purpose is to emphasize the subject “you.” Consider if you have a natural way to show this emphasis.

Some other ways you may be able to translate this are:

> so you yourselves must/should always do what is right

> now you must be holy in everything you do (NLT)

> you must be holy in every aspect of your life. (GW)

**holy:** It is important to use the same word here that you used in the previous verse part. In both verse parts translate with a word or phrase that can apply both to God and to people.

**in all you do:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *all you do* is a noun phrase that literally means “whole way of life” or “all conduct/behavior.” Several English versions have translated it as a noun or noun phrase. For example:

> in all your activity (NJB)

You may translate it with a verb, as the BSB does, or as a noun phrase, whichever is more natural in your language. Some other ways it has been translated include:

> in every aspect of your life (GW)

> in all your conduct (RSV)

##### **General Comment on 1:15**

In some languages it may be natural to reverse the order of verse parts 15a and 15b. For example:

> Instead, be holy in all that you do, just as God who called you is holy. (GNT)

> Instead, 15byou should always do what is right, 15abecause God called you to be his children and he always does what is right.

### Section 1:13–25: God wants believers to live holy lives

#### 1:16a

**for it is written:**

* For it is written in the Scriptures,
* For God said in the Holy Writing(s),
* Because Moses wrote in the Holy Writing(s) that God said,

Here in 1:16 Peter quoted from Leviticus 19:2\. You might want to include this information as a cross\-reference or footnote.

**for:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *for* can also be translated as “because.” This conjunction introduces the reason/basis for the command in 1:15b. Peter used this conjunction to join 1:15 with a quotation from the Old Testament in 1:16\.

This conjunction can be translated in different ways:

* Explicitly, using a conjunction such as *for*, “because,” or “since.” For example:

    > because it is written (NASB)

* Implicitly. For example:

    > The Scripture says (GNT)

Translate the conjunction in whichever of these ways is the most clear and natural in your language.

**it is written:** When Jesus taught people, he frequently used the phrase *it is written* to introduce a quotation from the Old Testament (for example, see Matthew 11:10\). Some writers of the New Testament also used *it is written* to introduce quotations from the Old Testament. See, for example, Romans 12:19, 14:11; 1 Corinthians 3:19; Galatians 3:10, 3:13\.Peter quoted the OT for the first time in this letter here at 1:16\. Though he included many other quotations from the Old Testament later in this letter, here is the only place where he used *it is written* to introduce a quotation. By saying *it is written*, Peter claims that his instruction to his readers in 1:15, to be holy, has the authority of God’s words that Moses recorded in the OT Scriptures.

Your language may require you to refer to the Old Testament in your translation. If you do not already know what you are going to call the writings in the Old Testament, you may be able to refer to the whole Old Testament as:

> the Book of God

> the Holy Writing(s)

> the Scriptures

You may want or need a more specific key term for the first five books of the Old Testament, which includes Leviticus. For example:

> the Law

The phrase *it is written* uses a passive verb. If your language requires you to say who did the writing, since Moses wrote Leviticus, you may be able to say:

> Moses wrote in the Holy Writing(s)

#### 1:16b

**“Be holy, because I am holy.”**

* “Be holy, because I your God am holy.”
* “Be completely good, because I am completely good.”
* “because I do what is right, you too must/should do what is right.

**Be holy:** This is a command that is a quotation of Leviticus 19:2\. God was commanding his people to *Be holy*. Try to use the same word for *holy* that you used to describe God in 1:15\.The Septuagint translated Leviticus 19:2 with the word for “holy” that Peter used. Jesus also quoted Leviticus 19:2 during the Sermon on the Mount, but Matthew’s account used a different Greek word, sometimes translated as “perfect,” than did Peter and the Septuagint. In Matthew 5:48, Jesus was speaking to Jews, people who grew up thinking of themselves as being God’s chosen people. Many had a deficient understanding of the righteousness necessary to have eternal life. In the context of the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus was telling the people that God’s standard of performance, in this case of loving, is no less than God’s own perfection. Peter, on the other hand, was writing largely to Gentiles who were not raised with this understanding. They had embraced Christ and His righteousness. The problem was not that the standard was set too low by tradition. Peter cautions them against the type of sin that their desires led them to commit before they were born again. Their call is to sanctification, to holiness. Peter may also have been playing on the fact that Christians were referred to as the saints, from the same root word that he used here for “holy.”

The phrase that the BSB translates as *Be holy* is literally “You shall be holy.” God used a future statement to give a command. Many translations (for example, ESV, NASB, NET) translate this as a future statement. Translate it in the way that would be most natural in your language.

**I am holy:** God was the original speaker of these words. At Leviticus 19:2, God identifies himself as the speaker. If in this context it would be natural in your language for God to identify himself, then you may be able to translate this in a similar way to the CEV, which says:

> I am the holy God (CEV)

##### **General Comment on 1:16a–b**

In some languages it may be natural to give the reason why God’s people were to be holy before the command to be holy. For example:

> For God says in the Scriptures/Writings, “I am holy, so you too must be holy.”

### Section 1:13–25: God wants believers to live holy lives

In this section Peter urged his readers to live holy lives (vv. 13–16\). Christ had paid a great price to save them (vv. 17–21\) and had given them new life (vv. 23–25\). In response to God’s kindness they should love one another (1:22\).

Some other headings for this section are:

### Paragraph 1:17–21

Some English versions do not begin a new paragraph here.That these versions take 1:13–21 to be a paragraph is reasonable, because to start a new paragraph at verse 17 divides what appears to be the chiastic structure that Peter intended. Instead, 1:13–21 forms a paragraph (GW, NET, NJB, RSV).

#### 1:17a

**Since you call on a Father**

* ¶ Since the one/God you address as your Father
* ¶ You call God your Father when you speak to him.
* ¶ The God whom you pray to as our(incl) Father

**Since you call on a Father:** There are two ways of interpreting the meaning of the Greek word that the BSB translates as *Since*:

1. It means since and implies that the statement that follows is an accepted fact. For example:

    > You say that God is your Father (CEV) *(BSB, NIV, NCV, NLT, GNT)*

2. It means if and introduces a statement that may or may not be true. For example:

    > If you address as Father (NASB) *(GW, KJV, NET, NJB, REB, RSV, NASB)*

Peter definitely thought of his readers as being God’s children who prayed to him as their Father (see 1:14a). Therefore, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).

**you call on a Father:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *you call on a Father* refers to calling God “Father” when speaking to him.

For example:

> You call him Father, when you pray to God (GNT)

Notice also that the GNT has included the phrase “when you pray to God” to make it clear that Peter was talking about praying to God.

**a Father:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *a Father* refers to God. In some languages it may be necessary to make this explicit. For example:

> You pray to God and call him Father (NCV)

#### 1:17b

**who judges each one’s work impartially,**

* judges everyone’s conduct fairly,
* He judges each person according to what they have done, without favouring one above another.
* treats all people in the same way; he decides according to what they have done.

**who judges each one’s work impartially:** This phrase describes God the Father. In some languages it may be natural to translate it as a separate sentence:

> He judges each one’s work impartially.

If you have not yet made it explicit that Peter is talking about God, it may be natural to do so here:

> the God who judges each one’s work impartially

**judges:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *judges* here means to decide or declare whether something is right or wrong. In this context it does not specifically mean “condemn.” Some work God declares to be right and good, and some work he *judges* to be wrong and evil.

The Greek verb *judges* refers to God’s judging activity in general. It does not specifically refer to any particular act of judging, past or future. The NLT translates *judges* here as:

> judge or reward (NLT)

**each one’s:** The Greek word that the BSB translates here as *each one’s* includes all human beings. Other ways to translate *each one’s* include:

> each person’s (NCV)

> everybody’s

> each individual’s (NJB)

**work:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *work* refers to someone’s conduct or lifestyle as a whole. There are several ways to translate it:

* Use a singular noun:

    > work (NIV11\)

* Use a verb phrase:

    > what they have done

* Use a plural noun:

    > their actions

Use the word or phrase that is natural in your language.

**impartially:** The word that the BSB translates as *impartially* literally means “without receiving faces” or “without receiving persons.” In other words, it means that God judges all people the same way, regardless of who they are. God is fair; he judges people justly, without bias or prejudice. Other ways to say that God judges “*impartially”* include:

> who judges everyone fairly

> who judges all people according to their actions without favoritism (CEV)

> who judges all people by the same standard (GNT)

Your language may have a suitable idiom that means “without favoring one person over another.” This idiom may use the idea of “face,” as the Greek expression does.

##### **General Comment on 1:17a–b**

In some languages it may be natural to translate 1:17a–b as a separate sentence:

> You call on God as your Father, and he judges each person without partiality.

#### 1:17c

**conduct yourselves in reverent fear during your stay as foreigners.**

* conduct yourselves with respectful fear of him while you live here as strangers.
* So you should respect/revere God during your time living here as strangers.
* Therefore, you should live with reverent awe for him during your temporary residence/stay here on earth.

1:17c gives the conclusion Peter drew from his statement in 1:17a–b. If you have translated 1:17a–b as a separate sentence, it may be natural to make it clear that 1:17c is a conclusion by using a word meaning “so” or “therefore.” For example:

> So you should live your lives as strangers here in reverent fear.

**conduct yourselves in reverent fear during your stay as foreigners:** The Greek clause that the BSB translates as *conduct yourselves in reverent fear during your stay as foreigners* may be translated literally as “conduct the time of your exile in fear.” The Greek text refers explicitly to the time when Peter’s readers were living in this world, away from heaven, their true home. Other ways to translate this include:

> live out the time of your temporary residence here (NET)

> while you are living in exile here on earth, behave

**reverent fear:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *reverent fear* is literally “fear.” In this context it refers to awe and wonder at the greatness and holiness of God. Other ways to translate it include:

> reverence (GNT)

> awe (REB)

> respect (NCV)

**stay as foreigners:** The phrase *stay as foreigners* means that Peter’s readers were only temporary residents of this world. His words imply that a Christian’s eternal home is with God in heaven (see 1:1c).

Many English versions make the location of this temporary residence explicit. For example:

> during the time of your stay on earth (NASB)

> during your time on earth (REB)

##### **General Comment on 1:17a–c**

Verse parts 17a–b give the reason for what Peter told his readers to do in 1:17c. In some languages it may be more natural to translate the command first, before the reason for it. For example:

> 17cDuring your stay here as temporary residents of this earth, behave with a respectful fear of God, 17bbecause he judges everyone’s conduct fairly, 17aand you call him “Father.”

> 17cLive in reverence for God during your stay here on earth. 17aFor you call him “Father,” 17band he is the impartial Judge of what everyone does.

### Paragraph 1:17–21

Some English versions do not begin a new paragraph here.That these versions take 1:13–21 to be a paragraph is reasonable, because to start a new paragraph at verse 17 divides what appears to be the chiastic structure that Peter intended. Instead, 1:13–21 forms a paragraph (GW, NET, NJB, RSV).

#### 1:18

People attach great value to silver and gold. However, these perishable material things do not have sufficient value to pay the price to free people from slavery to sin. Silver and gold are worthless compared to the blood of Christ, the price that was paid to free people from a life of sinning.

#### 1:18a

**For you know that**

* Do this because you know that
* You should do this because you understand that
* You should revere/fear him/God because you realise that

**For you know that:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *For you know that* is literally “knowing that,” continuing the sentence from v. 17\. You may wish to begin a new sentence here, as the BSB does. This phrase introduces another reason for Peter’s readers to fear God. Ways to make this clear include:

> Do this because you know that…

> You should do this because you understand that…

> You should revere/fear him/God because you realize that…

#### 1:18b

**it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed**

* it was not perishable things like silver or gold that he/God used to redeem/ransom you
* silver or gold, things that will not last, were not adequate payment to set you free
* He/God did not use/pay things that are only temporary, such as silver or gold money, to rescue you

**it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold:** Silver and gold do not last forever.Peter used a different word in Greek at 1:7 to speak about gold perishing than he did here at 1:18\. The meaning is virtually the same. It is true that they last a long time, but one day they will perish, because they belong only to this world. Peter said something similar about gold perishing at 1:7b–c.

**perishable things:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *perishable things* here means “things that will not last for ever”; that is, finite things. One day all material things, including silver and gold, will pass away or come to an end.

At 1:4b, Peter used the negative form of this same Greek word (“imperishable”). However, the way *perishable* is translated in this verse must go naturally with *silver or gold*. For this reason, you may not be able to use here a form of the word you used at 1:4b. Some other ways to translate perishable include:

> things…that don’t last forever (CEV)

> not something that can be destroyed (GNT)

> something that ruins (NCV)

**silver or gold:** In Peter’s time, coins were made of *silver or gold*. So this is a way of speaking about money. In some languages it may be necessary to make this explicit:

> silver or gold money

> money made of precious metal

**you were redeemed:** This is a passive verbal phrase. If you need to use an active verb and supply the subject, you should supply the subject “God.”

> God redeemed you

**redeemed:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *redeemed* refers to paying a price to free someone. People freed slaves or prisoners by paying money to their masters. Other verbs you may be able to use for *redeemed* are:

> rescued (CEV)

> set free (GNT)

> ransomed (RSV)

> bought your freedom (REB)

#### 1:18c

**from the empty way of life you inherited from your forefathers,**

* from living the worthless way of life that your ancestors taught you.
* from following the worthless customs that you inherited from previous generations.
* out of the useless manner of living that you learned from your ancestors.

**from the empty way of life:** Peter pictured his readers’ former *way of life* as a prison from which God had freed them.

**empty:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *empty* here means “of no benefit.” Other ways to translate it include:

> futile (RSV)

> worthless (GNT)

> useless (CEV)

Peter’s readers’ old *way of life* was futile, useless, and worthless because it did not lead them to God.

**way of life:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *way of life* refers to conduct and behavior. It is the same word that occurs in 1:15b. Here you may be able to translate it as:

> manner of life (GNT)

**you inherited from your forefathers:** The phrase *you inherited from your forefathers* means “that you received from your ancestors.” Each generation had learned this way of life from their parents, who in turn had learned it from their ancestors who lived before them. You may be able to say this as:

> inherited from your ancestors (NET)

> learned from your ancestors (CEV)

> traditional (REB)

> passed down from the people who lived before you (NCV)

Some English versions do not begin a new paragraph here.That these versions take 1:13–21 to be a paragraph is reasonable, because to start a new paragraph at verse 17 divides what appears to be the chiastic structure that Peter intended. Instead, 1:13–21 forms a paragraph (GW, NET, NJB, RSV).

#### 1:19

**but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or spot.**

* Instead, you were ransomed with the precious blood of Christ, which is like the blood of a perfect lamb with no defects.
* Rather, the payment that set you free was the costly/invaluable blood of Christ. His blood was like that of a spotless and innocent sacrificial lamb.
* No, he rescued/redeemed you by means of Christ’s precious lifeblood. Christ shed his blood when he died on the cross just as a pure and spotless lamb sheds its blood when it is put to death as a sacrifice.

In 1:18, Peter told his readers that God had not paid silver or gold to redeem them. Here in this verse, Peter told what price God did pay to redeem them. The payment was *the precious blood of Christ*.

Since this verse part continues a long sentence, it may be natural to start a new sentence here. For example:

> You were set free by Christ’s precious blood, blood like that of a lamb without mark or blemish. (REB)

**but:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *but* marks a strong contrast. The contrast is between perishable things such as silver or gold and “the precious blood of Christ.” Show this contrast in your language in a way that is natural. Some other ways to translate this include:

> instead

> rather

**with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or spot:** There are several ways of understanding what Peter was saying in this verse part:

1. He was comparing the *blood of Christ* to the blood of a lamb without blemish or defect. For example:

    > the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot (RSV) *(KJV, NASB, REB, RSV)*

2. He was comparing *Christ* to a *lamb without blemish or spot*. For example:

    > the precious blood of Christ, who was like a pure and perfect lamb (NCV) *(BSB, CEV, GW, NIV, NLT, GNT, NCV)*

3. He was both comparing the *blood of Christ* to the blood of a *lamb* and identifying the lamb with Christ. For example:

    > precious blood like that of an unblemished and spotless lamb, namely Christ (NET) *(NJB, NET)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\) and the majority of commentators.

**with the precious blood of Christ:** Peter was referring here to the blood that Jesus shed while he was dying on the cross. His blood spilled out as he was giving his life as a sacrifice. In some languages it may be necessary to make some of this explicit. For example:

> with the precious lifeblood of Christ (NLT)

> with the precious blood that Christ shed on the cross

**precious:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *precious* means “valuable, of great worth.” Here is another way to translate this word:

> costly (GNT)

**a lamb without blemish or spot:** In the Old Testament, God told the Israelites that the lambs they were to sacrifice must be *without…spot* (Leviticus 23:12; Numbers 6:14\). The *lamb* used at Passover Festival also had to be *without…spot* (Exodus 12:5\).

**without blemish or spot:** The sacrificial lamb had to be physically perfect. Jesus Christ was the perfect sacrifice in the sense that he was without sin. So if possible, the words that you use to translate *without blemish or spot* should apply to both physical and spiritual or moral perfection.

The Greek words that the BSB translates as *without blemish or spot* are literally “unblemished and spotless.” These two words are very similar in meaning. Using the two together emphasizes the physical perfection of the lamb.

Some other ways that you may be able to translate this phrase include:

> pure and perfect (NCV)

> with no flaws

> flawless

## 1 Peter 1:20 (id: 474506)

### Section 1:13–25: God wants believers to live holy lives

In this section Peter urged his readers to live holy lives (vv. 13–16\). Christ had paid a great price to save them (vv. 17–21\) and had given them new life (vv. 23–25\). In response to God’s kindness they should love one another (1:22\).

Some other headings for this section are:

> Live Holy Lives (GW)

> Chosen To Live a Holy Life (CEV)

### Paragraph 1:17–21

Some English versions do not begin a new paragraph here.That these versions take 1:13–21 to be a paragraph is reasonable, because to start a new paragraph at verse 17 divides what appears to be the chiastic structure that Peter intended. Instead, 1:13–21 forms a paragraph (GW, NET, NJB, RSV).

#### 1:20

Even before God created the world, he had already appointed his Son, Christ, to save mankind. Finally, after many ages had passed, Christ came into the world as a human being. God sent him to be the perfect sacrifice and save people from their sins.

#### 1:20a

**He was known before the foundation of the world,**

* He was predestined to do this before the world was created/made,
* Before the world existed, God chose Christ to ransom/redeem/free us(incl),
* God appointed him to die for us(incl) even before he created/made the world.

**He was known:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *He was known* is passive. If it is more natural in your language to use an active verb, you could say:

> God knew Jesus

God “knew” Jesus in the sense that he decided that Jesus would do a certain task. The expression does not mean that God selected Jesus from a group.The Greek word that the BSB translates as *known* is literally “foreknown.” The NASB, GW, and KJV translate literally. See the notes on 1:2a. Other ways to translate this include:

> God appointed/designated him

> he was predestined/destined (REB)

**before the foundation of the world:** The words that the BSB translates as *the foundation of the world* refer to God’s creating the world and everything in it. In some languages it may be natural to translate the abstract noun *foundation* as a verb. For example:

> before the world was created (CEV)

> before the world existed (GW)

> before God created/made the world

#### 1:20b

**but was revealed in the last times for your sake.**

* but for your benefit he has appeared in these final times.
* but in this final period of time before it ends, Christ came to earth for your good.
* Now, as its end is approaching, God sent him to earth to help you.

**but:** There are two ways of understanding the relationship between 1:20a and 1:20b:

1. The relationship is one of contrast. For example:

    > but (RSV) *(BSB, KJV, NASB, REB, NET, GW, NLT, NCV, CEV, NIV, RSV)*

2. The relationship is one of continuation. For example:

    > and (GNT) *(NJB, GNT)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\) and the majority of English versions.

**was revealed:** The verb phrase *was revealed* is referring to Christ’s life and ministry on earth during Peter’s lifetime. Christ came from heaven to earth for everyone to see him. The verb is passive. If it is more natural in your language to use an active verb, you may say:

> God revealed him

> God sent him to earth for all to see

> he appeared

**in the last times:** The period of *the last times* began when Jesus Christ “was revealed” in Peter’s time (see note above), and they will end when the world comes to an end.

There is a textual issue here. The Greek manuscripts do not all say the same thing:

1. Some Greek manuscripts speak of a period of time, literally “the ends of the times.” For example:

    > in this last period of time (REB) *(BSB, CEV, KJV, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, GNT, NLT, GW, REB, JBP)*

2. Some Greek manuscripts speak of a point of time, literally “the end of the times.” For example:

    > at the final point of time (NJB) *(RSV, NJB)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\) and the majority of English versions. You may be able to translate this phrase as:

> in this final period of time

> in these final times before the world ends

**for your sake:** In this context, the phrase *for your sake* means “for your benefit.” God sent Jesus Christ into the world for the benefit of all who trust him. He planned to do good to them by saving them from sin and giving them eternal life. Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> for your good (GW)

In some languages it may be necessary to use a verb form. For example:

> to help you

### Paragraph 1:17–21

Some English versions do not begin a new paragraph here.That these versions take 1:13–21 to be a paragraph is reasonable, because to start a new paragraph at verse 17 divides what appears to be the chiastic structure that Peter intended. Instead, 1:13–21 forms a paragraph (GW, NET, NJB, RSV).

#### 1:21a

**Through Him you believe in God,**

* Through him/Christ you trust in God,
* You became believers in God because of what he/Christ has done.

The Greek sentence continues here, but several English versions, including the BSB, start a new sentence here. For example:

> Through him you now trust in God (NET)

**Through Him:** The phrase *Through Him* means “Through Christ,” that is, by means of what Christ had done. Some other ways to translate this are:

> because of what he has done

> By means of what Christ has done

**you believe in God:** See how you translated *believe* in 1:8\.

#### 1:21b

**who raised Him from the dead and glorified Him;**

* who raised him from death and gave him glory/honour,
* God raised him back to life and honoured him.

**who raised Him from the dead:** The phrase *who raised Him from the dead* refers to God, whom Peter has just mentioned in 1:21a. God brought Christ back to life after he died on the cross. Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> who brought Christ back to life (GW)

**and glorified Him:** The Greek words that the BSB translates as *glorified Him* can be translated literally as “having given glory to him.” Another way to translate this phrase is:

> and gave him glory

Peter already mentioned Christ being glorified as part of the content of Old Testament prophecy (see the note at 1:11c on “glories”). Here Peter wrote that God had *glorified Him*. This means that God gave him great honor. This took place when God gave Jesus a resurrected body and took him to be with him in heaven. Jesus’ new body is free from human limitations and can never die again. Other ways to say this include:

> gave him great honor

> honored him

#### 1:21c

**and so your faith and hope are in God.**

* so that now you trust in God and put your hope in his goodness/kindness.
* Therefore you believe in God and hope in him.
* As a result, you trust God and look forward to receiving what he has promised to you.

**and so your faith and hope are in God:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *and so* has been interpreted in two ways:

1. It indicates result or consequence. They had faith and hope in God as a result of *God* raising Christ and giving him glory. For example:

    > so that your faith and hope are in God (RSV) *(BSB, CEV, GW, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, REB, GNT, RSV, NLT)*

2. It indicates purpose. *God* raised Christ and gave him glory in order that they should have faith and hope in God. For example:

    > for this very purpose—that your faith and hope should be in God (NJB) *(KJV, NJB)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), as most English versions do.

**faith and hope:** The Greek words that the BSB translates as *faith* and *hope* have closely related meanings. One way we can distinguish between them is:

* *faith*: The believers’ *faith* was their belief *in God* and their trust in him and in what he had done for them. See how you translated *faith* in 1:5a, 1:7a, and 1:9\.
* *hope*: The believers’ *hope* was their expectation that God would do good things for them in the future. They had confidence that *God* would keep the promises he had made concerning their inheritance (1:4a and 1:4b) and the new life he had prepared for them (1:3b).

Peter mentioned this *hope* previously at 1:3c and 1:13c.

If your language uses verbs instead of the nouns *faith* and *hope*, you may be able to translate them as:

> you believe in God and hope in him

> you trust God and look forward to the life he promised

### Section 1:13–25: God wants believers to live holy lives

In this section Peter urged his readers to live holy lives (vv. 13–16\). Christ had paid a great price to save them (vv. 17–21\) and had given them new life (vv. 23–25\). In response to God’s kindness they should love one another (1:22\).

Some other headings for this section are:

> Live Holy Lives (GW)

> Chosen To Live a Holy Life (CEV)

#### 1:22

Peter’s readers had accepted the good news about Jesus Christ that had been preached to them (1:12c). Believing this truth worked a change in them. It made them morally pure and caused them to love one another.

#### 1:22a

**Since you have purified your souls by obedience to the truth**

* ¶ You are now morally pure/clean because you have obeyed God’s true word/message,
* ¶ You have believed/accepted the truth about Christ/God therefore you have become morally pure.

**Since you have purified your souls:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *Since you have purified your souls* is literally “Having purified your souls.” The BSB has supplied the word *Since* to show that 1:22a is the grounds for Peter’s statement in 1:21\. Another way to express this is with the words “Now that.” For example:

> Now that you have purified yourselves… (NIV11\)

**you have purified your souls:** The phrase *you have purified your souls* means that Peter’s readers had made themselves morally and spiritually pure. They had turned away from their sins. Some other ways to translate this phrase are:

> You were cleansed from your sins (NLT)

> you have made yourselves pure

**your souls:** The Greek phrase that the BSB literally translates as *your souls* is the same as in 1:9\. The word *souls* refers to the whole person or self. You could translate this phrase as “yourselves,” as many English versions do.

**by obedience to the truth:** The phrase *obedience to the truth* refers to when Peter’s readers first believed *the truth* about God and Christ and became Christians. When they did not know the truth, their desires led them to sin (1:14b). By accepting the truth and desiring to live according to it, they purified themselves.These Notes take the position that Peter referred here to initial conversion. Abernathy (page 53\) lists two commentaries that say “by obeying the truth” is the means for purification (Grudem, Alford). According to Abernathy, both of these commentaries understand the purification to be an ongoing process, rather than at initial conversion. Another way to translate this phrase is:

> obeying God’s true message

**obedience:** Peter used the Greek word that the BSB translates as *obedience* in 1:2c and 1:14a.

#### 1:22b

**so that you have a genuine love for your brothers,**

* and so you have a sincere/genuine love for each other.
* As a result, you truly love your fellow believers/Christians.

**so that you have a genuine love for your brothers:** Peter’s readers had a *genuine love for* their fellow believers in Christ.

**so that:** There are two ways of understanding the Greek preposition that the BSB translates as *so that*:

1. It introduces a result. Peter’s readers were able to love other Christians because they had been purified. For example:

    > As a result you have a sincere love for each other. (GW) *(BSB, CEV, KJV, NIV, NRSV, REB, GNT, NCV, NJB, GW)*

2. It introduces a purpose. Peter’s readers purified themselves in order to love other Christians. For example:

    > You have purified your souls…in order to show sincere mutual love. (NET) *(NASB, RSV, NET)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), with the majority of English versions.

**genuine:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *genuine* is literally “unhypocritical.” Other words that can be used are:

> true (NCV)

> sincere (NIV11\)

> honest

**love for your brothers:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *love for your brothers* means “love for all other Christians.” Peter was using the word *brothers* figuratively to represent fellow believers. So by it he meant the entire church, including both men and women. So you could translate this phrase as:

> affection towards your fellow\-Christians (REB)

> love for other believers (GNT)

> love for your Christian brothers and sisters (NCV)

> mutual love (NET)

**love:** It may be more natural in your language to translate *love* as a verb. For example:

> sincerely love (CEV)

> truly love

> honestly love

#### 1:22c

**love one another deeply, from a pure heart.**

* So I am telling you to love one another very much with all your heart.
* Therefore, you should love each other truly and earnestly.

**love one another deeply:** The Greek verb that the BSB translates here as *love* is a command, and it is the main verb of this sentence (1:22–23\).

**love:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *love* here is a different word than the one at 1:22b. You may use the same word in your translation for both, since the meanings are very similar. However, if it would be more natural in your language to use two different words, then you may do as Peter did in Greek.

**deeply:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *deeply* can also be translated as:

> warmly (GW)

> earnestly (RSV)

> fervently

**from a pure heart:** There is a textual issue here:

1. Some Greek texts have from a pure heart. For example:

    > from a pure heart (ESV) *(BSB, ESV, KJV, NET)*

2. Some Greek texts have from the heart. For example:

    > from the heart (NRSV) *(GW, NASB, NIV, NRSV)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\), since that reading is found in several reliable ancient manuscripts.

**pure:** In this context, the word *pure* refers to something that has nothing else mixed in with it. Other ways to say this include:

> from a sincere heart

> with genuine affection

**heart:** In the minds of Peter’s readers, the *heart* was associated with thoughts and ideas as well as emotions and feelings. So the Greek word that many English versions translate as *heart* is an idiom that means much the same as “deeply.” If you choose to use a figure of speech, use an idiom or metaphor from your own language that refers to seeking someone else’s well\-being.

Some English versions keep the *heart* figure. For example:

> love each other deeply with all your heart (NCV)

> love one another wholeheartedly with all your strength (REB)

In some languages it may be necessary to remove the *heart* figure. For example:

> love each other deeply and earnestly

##### **General Comment on 1:22a–c**

In some languages it may be natural to reorder the parts of 1:22\. For example:

> 22c You should love each other deeply and earnestly. After all, 22byou have true affection for each other because 22ayou purified yourselves from your sin(s) when you accepted the true teaching concerning Christ.

### Section 1:13–25: God wants believers to live holy lives

In this section Peter urged his readers to live holy lives (vv. 13–16\). Christ had paid a great price to save them (vv. 17–21\) and had given them new life (vv. 23–25\). In response to God’s kindness they should love one another (1:22\).

Some other headings for this section are:

> Live Holy Lives (GW)

> Chosen To Live a Holy Life (CEV)

#### 1:23

In this verse, Peter gave his readers another reason for his exhortation in 1:22c. They had been born again through God’s permanent living word (1:23\). Therefore, they ought to love each other fervently (1:22c).

#### 1:23a

**For you have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable,**

* For you have been born again, not from perishable seed, but from seed that does not perish,
* Do this because you have received new life/birth, and it is not from seed that dies, but from seed that does not die,
* You should love each other because it is by means of something indestructible that God has made your lives new. It is not by means of seed that will not last.

**For:** In Greek, this verse begins with a participle that signals that Peter is writing an additional reason/basis for his readers to love each other, as he urged them to do in 1:22c. Some other ways to signal this relationship are:

> since…

> because…

> Do this because…

> You should love each other because…

**you have been born again:** The Greek participle that the BSB translates as *you have been born again* is passive.These are the only two places that the verb *anagennaō* is used in the New Testament. Peter used the active form of this verb at 1:3b. Refer to your translation of that verse and the note there on “He has given us new birth.”

Your language may require that you make this clause active and specify who caused them to be born again. For example:

> God has caused you to be born again (CEV)

> God has given you a new life

> God has made your lives new

**not of perishable seed:** The phrase *not of perishable seed* means “not from a seed that will perish.” It was not some finite or material seed that gave Peter’s readers new birth. See the note on 1:18b, where the same Greek word for *perishable* is used.

The Greek word that the BSB translates literally as *seed* can refer to either male seed or plant seed. Therefore there are two ways of interpreting the phrase *perishable seed*:

1. It refers to human reproduction.See Selwyn, pages 150–151; Kelly, page 80; Marshall, page 61; Achtemeier, page 139; Lenski, page 73\. For example:

    > not of mortal…parentage (REB) *(NLT, GNT, REB)*

2. It refers to the seeds of plants.See Kistemaker, page 72\. This is the more normal use of the English word *seed*.

Since the Greek word can mean both things, the original readers could have thought of both kinds of seed.See Michaels, page 76\. If you must choose between the two, it is recommended that you choose interpretation (1\).

**but of imperishable:** The word *imperishable* modifies the implied word “seed.” “Imperishable seed” is a figure of speech that illustrates how Peter’s readers received their new life. There are two ways of understanding what it refers to:

1. It refers to God’s word. For example:

    > but imperishable, that is…the…word of God (NASB) *(NJB, GW, NLT, CEV, NASB; probably NCV)*

2. It refers to God. For example:

    > a parent who is immortal (GNT) *(REB, GNT)*

Some versions are ambiguous and do not say to what “imperishable seed” refers (KJV, NET, RSV). If you must choose one of the two interpretations, it is recommended that you follow the interpretation (1\).

##### **General Comment on 1:23a**

In some languages it may not be possible to keep the *seed* figure of speech. Some English versions have translated without this figure. For example:

> this new life did not come from something that dies, but from something that cannot die (NCV)

However, because of the context, it is recommended that you do keep the seed figure or a similar figure, if possible.

#### 1:23b

**through the living and enduring word of God.**

* through the living and permanent word/message from God.
* that is, through God’s word/message which lives forever.
* He/God made your lives new by means of his living word/message that never dies.

**through:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *through* here means “by means of.” In this context it apparently means much the same as the preposition translated as “of” in 1:23a. The word of God was the means that God used to give the believers new birth. Here is another way to translate this word:

> by (CEV)

**living and enduring:** The words *living and enduring* are similar in meaning. They are used together for emphasis. Other ways that you may be able to say *living and enduring* include:

> living and abiding (RSV)

> living and eternal (GNT)

> that lives for ever

> that lives and never dies

**word of God:** The phrase the *word of God* refers to the same thing as “the truth” in 1:22a. It is the message from God concerning the good news about Jesus Christ. Other ways you may be able to say *word of God* include:

> God’s message

> word/message from God

* **Associated Passages:** 1PE 1:23

## 1 Peter 1:24 (id: 474510)

### Section 1:13–25: God wants believers to live holy lives

In this section Peter urged his readers to live holy lives (vv. 13–16\). Christ had paid a great price to save them (vv. 17–21\) and had given them new life (vv. 23–25\). In response to God’s kindness they should love one another (1:22\).

Some other headings for this section are:

> Live Holy Lives (GW)

> Chosen To Live a Holy Life (CEV)

#### 1:24–25

In 1:24–25a, Peter quoted from the Old Testament (probably the LXX) to confirm what he had said in 1:23, that God’s word is permanent and cannot be destroyed. The quotation is from Isaiah 40:6–8\. Isaiah illustrated how short the lives of people are by comparing them to grass and wild flowers that live for only a short time. In contrast, the word of the Lord endures for ever.

#### 1:24a

**For,**

* For Scripture says:
* The Scripture says:
* Because as the prophet Isaiah said/wrote,

**For:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *For* signals that what follows supports or illustrates what Peter wrote in 1:23\. What follows is a quotation from the Old Testament. Peter quoted the prophet Isaiah (Isaiah 40:6–8\). It is recommended that you make it clear to your readers that this is a quotation. You could do this in a footnote or make it explicit in the text. For example:

> As the scripture says (GNT)

> That’s why Scripture says (GW)

> The prophet Isaiah said/wrote

If you follow the first or second example, you may translate “Scripture” with the term you use for the Old Testament. If you have a more specific term for the writings of the Old Testament prophets, you may use it here.

#### 1:24b

**“All flesh is like grass,**

* “All people are like grass,
* “Human life is like grass,
* “We(incl) are all like grass that dies quickly.

**All flesh is like grass:** This is a simile. Peter is quoting the prophet Isaiah, who was comparing people to grass in order to illustrate and emphasize that they only live for a short time. In some languages it may be necessary to make the point of comparison explicit. For example:

> Humans wither like grass (CEV)

> People are like grass that dies away (NLT)

In other languages it may be more natural to make the comparison by using a metaphor. For example:

> all humanity is grass (NJB)

**All flesh:** This is the beginning of what Peter quoted from the Old Testament. The Greek words that the BSB translates as *All flesh* refer to people. Some English versions have chosen to translate it literally (KJV, NASB, NET, RSV). In this context it refers to all human beings, both male and female. Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> All people (GW)

**grass:** Peter was referring to the wild grass that grows in an open area or field. The term *grass* here seems to include the various plants that grow in among the grass and have flowers. It is recommended that you use a general word for *grass* in your language.

#### 1:24c

**and all its glory like the flowers of the field;**

* and all of their beauty/importance is temporary, like the wildflowers.
* and human beauty fades quickly, like the beauty of wild flowers in the field.
* We(incl) quickly lose our beauty/attractiveness, just as wildflowers do.

**and all its glory like the flowers of the field:** This is another simile. Peter quoted Isaiah, comparing human good looks to wild flowers. They are similar in that both last for only a short time. In some languages it may be natural or necessary to make this point of comparison explicit. For example:

> their glory fades like wild flowers (CEV)

> their beauty fades as quickly as the beauty of wildflowers (NLT)

**its glory:** In this context, the word that the BSB and most English versions translate as *glory* refers to human attractivenessIn some languages, it might be possible to refer more generally to “strength” or “vitality” associated with youth. or good looks. Several English versions have translated this as:

> beauty (NLT)

**the flowers of the field:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *the flowers of the field* is literally “flower of grass.” The Greek word for “grass” here is the same as in 1:24b. Apparently, this Greek word included the flowering plants that grow in fields with grass. (See the note on “grass” at 1:24b.) Some English versions have translated this as:

> wild flowers (GNT)

#### 1:24d

**the grass withers and the flowers fall,**

* Grass withers and flowers drop from their stems,
* The grass dies and the flower falls to the ground,
* The grass becomes dry and the flowers die,

**the grass withers and the flowers fall:** In this verse part, Peter quoted Isaiah, explaining in what way grass and wild flowers are like people and different from the word of God.

**the grass withers:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *withers* here means that the grass dries up and dies. Other ways this has been translated include:

> dies (NCV)

> dries up (CEV)

**the flowers fall:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *fall* means “to fall off/from.” In this context, the *flowers*, having served their brief purpose, fell off the stems that supported them. Other ways you may be able to translate this include:

> the flower drops off (GW)

> the flower falls away (NLT)

> the flowers fall down from their stems

> the flowers fall to the ground

You may use flower(sing) or *flowers*(plur), whichever sounds most natural in your language.

* but the Lord’s word/message will remain forever.”
* but the Lord’s word/message never dies.”

This verse part completes the quotation from Isaiah.

**but:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *but* introduces a contrast with the previous verse part. Show this contrast in a way that is natural in your language.

**the word of the Lord stands forever:** The phrase *the word of the Lord stands for ever* means “what the Lord says remains for all time.” God’s message will never fail and never cease to exist. Different ways to translate this phrase include:

> the word of the Lord endures forever (NRSV)

> what the Lord has said will always be valid

> the Lord’s message will continue/last for ever

**word:** The Greek wordThe Septuagint translated from Isaiah 40:8 with the Greek word *rhēma*, and that is the Greek word that Peter used in quoting Isaiah. that the BSB translates as *word* at 1:25a is different from the one translated as *word* at 1:23b. Most scholars feel that these two words have the same meaning in this context. It is recommended that you translate them the same way, unless the style of your language favors using different words.

**Lord:** Peter wrote “the…word of God” at 1:23b. The Greek translation of the Old Testament that existed when Peter wrote this letter (LXX) also had “the word of God” in the passage Peter quoted from Isaiah. Therefore, Peter seems to have made an intentional switch from God to *Lord* here. It is recommended that you translate *Lord* here literally.

**stands:** The Greek word that the BSB translates here as *stands* is a form of the Greek verb that is translated as “enduring” at 1:23b. Use forms of the same word in your translation if this would be natural in your language. Other ways this word has been translated include:

> lasts (GW)

> remains (NLT)

> will live (NCV)

#### 1:25b

**And this is the word that was proclaimed to you.**

* And this is the same word/message that they/people preached to you.
* This word/message of/from the Lord is the good news about Jesus Christ that you heard.
* The gospel that his/the\-Lord’s followers announced to you is this word/message that remains forever.

The quotation from Isaiah 40:6–8 ended with 1:25a. Peter was no longer quoting Isaiah here at 1:25b.

**And this is the word that was proclaimed to you:** Peter equated the word of the Lord, from the Isaiah quotation (1:25a), with *the word that* had been *proclaimed to* his readers.

**this:** The word *this* refers to the word of the Lord mentioned in 1:25a.

**the word:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *word* here at 1:25b is the same one Peter used in 1:25a.

**was proclaimed:** This is a passive verb. If it is more natural in your language to use an active verb, you may say:

> people/evangelists preached

The Greek word that the BSB translates as *was proclaimed* is related to the Greek word that is often translated as “gospel” or “good news.” Because of this, many English versions include either “gospel” or “good news” in their translation of 1:25b. For example:

> That word is the good news that was announced to you. (NRSV)

> And this ‘word’ is the gospel which was preached to you. (REB)

## 1 Peter 2:1 (id: 474512)

### Section 2:1–12: Christ is the cornerstone and believers are his holy people

In this section Peter used illustrations from the Old Testament to describe how important Christ was and how holy Christians should be. Christ was like the most important stone in a building. Christians belong to him and so should live holy lives.

Some other headings for this section are:

> Live as God’s Chosen People (GW)

> A Living Stone and a Holy People (CEV)

#### 2:1

Peter had just explained to his readers that God had caused them to be born again through his eternal word (1:23–25\). Therefore, sin should not have any place in their lives.

#### 2:1a

**Rid yourselves, therefore, of**

* ¶ Therefore, you should refrain completely from
* ¶ Since you have been born again as God’s children, you should never

**Rid yourselves:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Rid yourselves* was used in a variety of ways. People used this word to speak of taking off old clothing and of removing dirt from the body. Peter meant that his readers were to be completely finished with the sins he was about to list. They were not to act like this any more.

Some other ways you may be able to translate this verb include:

> avoid doing

> refrain completely from doing

> do not even consider doing

**therefore:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *therefore* signals that what Peter was about to write followed from something he had already written. Most likely, it follows from what Peter wrote in 1:22–25 concerning his readers having been born again through the living and enduring word of God. You may be able to say something like:

> Because of this, rid yourselves

> Since you have been born again through God’s word, rid yourselves

See how you translated “Therefore” in 1:13a.

#### 2:1b–c

**malice, deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander:** There are two ways of interpreting the relationship of the Greek word that the BSB translates as *malice* to the rest of the list:

1. *Malice* refers to hostile attitudes and behavior towards other people; it is a specific sin, like the others in the list. For example:

    > spite (NJB) *(BSB, KJV, CEV, NASB, RSV, NJB, NIV, NLT)*

2. *Malice* refers to evil in general and summarizes the specific sins that follow. For example:

    > evil (GNT) *(REB, NET, GW, NCV, GNT)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). See the notes below for more information on each of these words.

#### 2:1b

**all malice, deceit,**

* doing anything malicious, and from deceiving people in any way,
* do anything to harm other people, or lie to trick them.

**all:** In this context, the Greek word that the BSB twice translates as *all* means “any and every” or “all kinds of.” Peter actually uses this word three times in this list, for emphasis. Some translations show this. For example:

> all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander (ESV)

**malice:** The word *malice* refers to having the desire to hurt other people or to see others suffer. In some languages it may be necessary to translate abstract nouns such as *malice* as verb phrases:

> being hateful (CEV)

> hurting/harming other people

**deceit:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *deceit* refers to such as craftiness, treachery, and telling lies in order to trick people. Other ways to translate the word *deceit* include:

> deception (GW)

> lying (NCV)

> deceiving people

#### 2:1c

**hypocrisy, envy, and slander.**

* from lying about yourself, from jealousy, and from any speaking evil about others.
* You should never pretend to be different/better than you really are, or envy others, or speak unkindlyabout them.

**hypocrisy:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *hypocrisy* means pretending to be something other than what you really are. This word could also be used of an insincere person.

If your language does not use abstract nouns such as *hypocrisy*, then you may be able to translate this as:

> Do not lie about yourself

> You should not pretend to be different/better than you really are

> Never be insincere

**envy:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *envy* refers to resenting or hating someone else because of their greater possessions, abilities, or status. It can also be translated as:

> jealousy (GW)

**slander:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *slander* means to say something untrue about a person in order to hurt him. Other ways to translate this word include:

> lying about someone

> defame/defamation

> insulting language (GNT)

* **Associated Passages:** 1PE 2:1

## 1 Peter 2:2 (id: 474513)

### Section 2:1–12: Christ is the cornerstone and believers are his holy people

In this section Peter used illustrations from the Old Testament to describe how important Christ was and how holy Christians should be. Christ was like the most important stone in a building. Christians belong to him and so should live holy lives.

Some other headings for this section are:

> Live as God’s Chosen People (GW)

> A Living Stone and a Holy People (CEV)

#### 2:2

Peter used the desire that newborn babies have for their mothers’ milk as an illustration. He told the believers to desire God’s word in the same way that babies desire their mothers’ milk. In this way they would continue to grow strong as Christians until they experienced the final salvation God had for them.

#### 2:2a

**Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk,**

* As new babies long/thirst for milk, so you should long/thirst for God’s pure word/message,
* You should desire to hear/receive God’s truthful word/message just as a newborn baby wants to drink its mother’s milk.

**Like newborn babies:** This is a simile. Peter was saying that his readers should have a strong desire for God’s word, just as babies have a strong desire for their mother’s milk.

**newborn babies:** This is the only place in the New Testament where the Greek word that the BSB translates as *newborn* is used. Its use here probably implies that the *babies* in Peter’s illustration had no other food and wanted no other food. Those who are *newborn babies* are completely dependent on their mothers’ milk.

**babies:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *babies* refers to very small children. Several English versions translate it as “infants.” For example, the NET says:

> yearn like newborn infants for… (NET)

If your language has a word or expression referring to babies in the first few weeks of their life, you may be able to use it here. In that case it may not be necessary to translate *newborn* separately and explicitly.

**crave pure spiritual milk:** The phrase *crave pure spiritual milk* describes how Peter wanted his readers to be like newborn babies. The *pure spiritual milk* is a metaphor for God’s word. Peter wanted them to *crave* it.

**crave:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *crave* is a command meaning “desire.” Other ways to translate this include:

> Be…thirsty for (CEV)

> long for (RSV)

> yearn…for (NET)

The Greek text has a definite article that is not explicit in the BSB. Many English versions do make it explicit. For example, the RSV says:

> long for the pure spiritual milk

Consider if it is natural in your language to make the definite article explicit in this context. In some language doing so may help show that the *pure spiritual milk* is a metaphor.

**pure:** The Greek adjective that the BSB translates as *pure* can means “sincere” or “without deceit.” As a description of milk, it can be translated as “unadulterated,” that is, not watered down. As a description of God’s word, it can be translated as:

> truthfulIn English, there is a problem with translating this as “true.” The Greek word that precedes (lemma: *logikos*) is understood by some scholars to signal that this is figurative, being a metaphor, not literal. To say then that it is “true…milk” is potentially contradictory. For this reason, the suggestion in the Notes is for “truthful,” not “true.”

Consider if there is a word in your language that could cover both ideas. If not, you will have to choose between describing the metaphor (*milk*) or the topic the metaphor represents (God’s word).

**spiritual milk:** There is a play on words here. The Greek word that the BSB translates as *spiritual* is from a root meaning “word.” Peter was implying that the *spiritual milk* was a figure of speech referring to the word of God.See the footnote in the NET. Translations vary as to which aspect of the figure of speech they translate:(1\) “spiritual” (BSB, NJB, NIV, RSV, GNT, REB, NET, NLT, CEV)(2\) “of the word” (KJV, NASB, GW, NCV)

**milk:** Here, *milk* refers to a mother’s milk. It represents food that is nourishing and life\-giving, and it is a metaphor for God’s word. If you make this explicit, you may want to consider how you translated “the word of God” and “the word of the Lord” at 1:23b and 1:25a. See the General Comment below for more information.

##### **General Comment on 2:2a**

In some languages it may be necessary to make explicit something of the meaning of the metaphor in 2:2a. There are various ways of doing this. For example:

> Desire God’s pure word as newborn babies desire milk. (GW)

> As newborn babies want milk, you should want the pure and simple teaching. (NCV)

#### 2:2b

**so that by it you may grow up in your salvation,**

* so that by/through this word you may grow strong/mature and receive full salvation.
* in order for it to nourish you until you are completely saved.
* Then, by continuing to feed on it, you will thrive until God saves you from all sin.

**so that by it you may grow up:** Peter wanted his readers to desire God’s word (2:2a) so that they would continue to listen to it and/or read it. In this way they would receive spiritual nourishment and become strong and mature believers.

**so that:** The Greek preposition that the BSB translates as *so that* introduces the purpose for desiring (and therefore receiving) spiritual milk. Here is another way to translate this:

> Then (GW)

**by it:** God’s word/teaching was to be the means by which Peter’s readers received their spiritual food. Peter was implying that because they desired God’s word, the believers would actually hear and read it. The GNT has made this explicit by including drinking as part of the milk metaphor:

> so that by drinking it you may grow up (GNT)

**you may grow up:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *you may grow up* is a form of a Greek verb that could mean *grow* or “increase” or “spread.” It can also be translated as “thrive.”E. G. Selwyn, in his commentary on the First Epistle of St. Peter, translates *auxēthēte* as “thrives,” page 156\. For example:

> so that you may thrive on it (REB)

Peter was not telling his readers that they would *grow up* and no longer need the milk of God’s word. In Peter’s metaphor, all Christians remain babies who continue to need the nourishment of this milk in order to grow. Peter wanted his readers to continue to feed on God’s word and *grow* until their final *salvation*.

The way you translate this may depend on what sounds natural in your language. Some ways to say this include:

> you will drink it and grow

> it will nourish you

> that by continuing to drink it you will thrive

> that will help you grow (CEV)

**in your salvation:** There are two ways of interpreting the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *in your salvation*:

1. It means “resulting in your salvation”; that is, towards the goal of receiving final salvation from God. For example:

    > grow and be saved (CEV) *(GNT, NJB, REB, NET, CEV, NCV, RSV)*

2. It means “in or in regards to your salvation,” that is, it refers to becoming a strong and mature believer. For example:

    > grow into a full experience of salvation (NLT) *(BSB, NLT, NIV, NASB, GW)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). Peter was probably talking about the same salvation he referred to in 1:5\. This is the salvation when God will deliver believers from all sin and suffering.

**your salvation:** In some languages it may be necessary to translate the abstract noun *salvation* as a verb:

> you may…be saved (GNT)

> God may/will save you

* **Associated Passages:** 1PE 2:2

## 1 Peter 2:3 (id: 474514)

### Section 2:1–12: Christ is the cornerstone and believers are his holy people

In this section Peter used illustrations from the Old Testament to describe how important Christ was and how holy Christians should be. Christ was like the most important stone in a building. Christians belong to him and so should live holy lives.

Some other headings for this section are:

> Live as God’s Chosen People (GW)

> A Living Stone and a Holy People (CEV)

#### 2:3

**now that you have tasted that the Lord is good.**

* For you have tasted/experienced the Lord’s kindness towards you.
* For you have already seen/experienced how kind/good the Lord is to us(incl).
* Do this because you know that the Lord Jesus Christ is good. You know this because he has been kind to you.

Here in 2:3, Peter gave his readers a reason why they should continue to desire the spiritual milk of God’s word. They had already experienced that the Lord is kind.

Peter used words from Psalm 34:8\. His readers would recognize these words, even though Peter modified the words in order to apply them directly to these believers. Because Peter modified these words, most English versions do not introduce this verse as an Old Testament quotation.

Some ways to show that 2:3 is a quote from the Psalms are:

* Say in a footnote that Peter was referring to Psalm 34:8\.
* Introduce it in the text as a quotation. For example:

    > As the scripture says, “You have found out for yourselves how kind the Lord is.” (GNT)

**now that:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *now that* is literally “if.” In this context this word introduces a condition that had been fulfilled. Peter believed that his readers had already experienced that the Lord is kind. He was assuming that this was true. Different ways to translate this include:

> for (RSV)

> because (NCV)

> since

**you have tasted:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *you have tasted* continues the metaphor of babies drinking milk. Peter is using the word *tasted* as a figure of speech here to mean “experienced.” It is possible to translate this figure of speech in two ways:

* Continuing with the “milk” metaphor of 2:2\. For example:

    > you have already tasted (NASB)

    > you have had a taste (NLT)

* Translating the meaning of the metaphor. For example:

    > You have found out for yourselves (GNT)

    > you have experienced (NET)

Whether or not you choose a verb that continues the “milk” metaphor will depend on which way communicates best in your language.

**that the Lord is good:** Peter has already explained in chapter 1 how kind *the Lord* had been to these Christians. Peter’s readers were able to know this because they knew what Christ had done to save them from sin and death.

**the Lord:** In the verse in the Psalms from which Peter was quoting, *the Lord* refers to God. Most scholars agree, however, that here in 1 Peter *the Lord* refers to Christ. The English versions do not make this explicit. It is recommended that you use a word for *Lord* that can refer to both God and Christ.

**good:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *good* is an adjective that describes *the Lord*. It is also possible to translate it as:

> kind (GNT)

##### **General Comment on 2:3**

In order to show the connection with 2:2, you may need to repeat Peter’s exhortation to his readers to desire God’s word. Also, you may need to make it explicit that they knew the Lord was good/kind because he had been good/kind to them. For example:

> Do this because you know that the Lord Jesus Christ is good. You know this because he has been kind to you.

Some other headings for this section are:

> Live as God’s Chosen People (GW)

> A Living Stone and a Holy People (CEV)

### Paragraph 2:4–8

In this paragraph, Peter used a metaphor that compared Jesus Christ to a stone. He quoted three passages from the Old Testament that also used the metaphor of a stone to speak about the Christ whom God had promised to send:

1. In 2:6 Peter quoted from Isaiah 28:16\.
2. In 2:7 Peter quoted from Psalm 118:22\.
3. In 2:8 Peter quoted from Isaiah 8:14\.

#### 2:4a

**As you come to Him, the living stone,**

* ¶ You come to him, the stone who lives,
* ¶ You are coming to Jesus Christ, who is like a stone that is alive.

**As you come to Him:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *As you come* is literally “coming.” There are two ways to interpret this word:

1. It states a fact. Peter’s readers were coming to Jesus Christ. For example:

    > You are coming to Christ (GW) *(BSB, KJV, NASB, NET, NIV, GW)*

2. It is a command. Peter told his readers to come to Christ. For example:

    > Come to him (RSV) *(GNT, CEV, NCV, NJB, NLT, REB, RSV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). Peter was encouraging his readers. He was writing about what happened as they came to Christ.

**come to Him:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *come to Him* refers to believers approaching Christ in worship and service. It could also refer to new believers coming to Christ in faith for salvation. You should translate *come* in a general way that could include both of these meanings.This note assumes interpretation (1\) for the meaning of “as you come.” If a translation follows interpretation (2\), then the coming to Christ refers to conversion.

**to Him:** The Greek words that the BSB translates as *to him* may be translated literally as “to whom.” This refers to “the Lord” in 2:3, who is Jesus Christ. Some English versions have made this explicit. For example:

> to the Lord Jesus (NCV)

**the living stone:** Since stones are not alive, the adjective *living* shows that Peter was using a figure of speech. He was using the metaphor of a *living stone* to refer to Christ.

It may be more natural in your language to translate this metaphor as a simile. For example:

> who is like a living stone

**living:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *living* means “lives” or “is alive.”

Other places in this letter where Peter used the Greek word that the BSB translates here as *living* are 1:3, 1:23, 2:5, 4:5\.Peter used other, nonparticipial forms of the verb *zaō* at 2:24 and 4:6\.

**stone:** Some translations, such as the NIV, capitalize the word “Stone” because in this context it is a title for God the Son. The Greek text permits capitalizing the word. The earliest Greek manuscripts were written in all capital letters, and so it is not possible to determine from them what words the authors would have capitalized if they had been following modern conventions.

In New Testament times, houses and temples were generally built out of stones. The context makes it clear that Peter was referring to a stone of the size and shape that people could use for building.

#### 2:4b

**rejected by men but chosen and precious in God’s sight,**

* a stone rejected by people but chosen and valued by God.
* Even though people discarded this stone, to God it was precious/priceless, and God chose/selected to use it.

**rejected by men but chosen and precious in God’s sight:** This verse part contrasts how people viewed the living Stone with how God viewed it.This contrast is marked with the particles *men* and *de*. See the notes on 1:20a, where Peter used the same construction. Other ways to indicate this contrast include:

> On the one hand, it was rejected by people, while on the other hand, it was chosen by God and precious to him

> though rejected by mortals yet chosen and precious in God’s sight (NRSV)

In some languages it may be necessary to replace the passive forms *rejected* and *chosen* with active verbs. For example:

> Even though people rejected it, God chose it and valued it

**rejected:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *rejected* can also be translated as “did not accept.” In the metaphor, people chose not to use this particular stone. The meaning in the metaphor is that people did not accept Jesus as the Messiah. Other ways you may be able to say this include:

> Many people…did not want this stone (NCV)

> This stone was discarded by human beings

> People treated it/him with disdain/contempt

**by men:** In this context, the Greek word that the BSB translates as *men* means people in general, including both *men* and women. Some translations make this explicit. For example:

> rejected by human beings (NJB)

> rejected by the people (NLT)

> rejected by mortals (NRSV)

**chosen and precious in God’s sight:** The Greek expression that the BSB translates as *chosen…and precious* is literally “chosen, precious.” The GNT makes the implied relationship between the adjectives explicit:

> chosen by God as valuable (GNT)

**chosen:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *chosen* in this context means “selected.” In the metaphor, God selected this particular stone because he considered it valuable.

This is a passive clause. In some languages it may be more natural to use an active verb:

> God chose it

> he was the stone God chose (NCV)

**precious:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *precious* indicates that God considered the living stone, Jesus Christ, to be very valuable. Other ways to translate *precious* include:

> immensely valuable (JBP)

> priceless (NET)

> of great worth (REB)

**in God’s sight:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *in God’s sight* is literally “with God.” The BSB uses an English idiom to convey the sense that this is referring to what God regards or considers the stone to be. Your language may have an idiom of its own that you could use here. Other ways to translate this include:

> chosen by God and precious to him (NIV)

> chosen and precious with God

##### **General Comment on 2:4a–b**

In some languages it may be natural in your language to reorder 2:4a–b. For example:

> 4b Jesus Christ is like a stone that many people have discarded but that God has chosen as valuable. 4aYou have come to this living stone….

In this paragraph, Peter used a metaphor that compared Jesus Christ to a stone. He quoted three passages from the Old Testament that also used the metaphor of a stone to speak about the Christ whom God had promised to send:

1. In 2:6 Peter quoted from Isaiah 28:16\.
2. In 2:7 Peter quoted from Psalm 118:22\.
3. In 2:8 Peter quoted from Isaiah 8:14\.

#### 2:5a

**you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house**

* You, also, are like living stones, and you are being built into a spiritual house
* You too are like living/spiritual stones that God uses to build into a spiritual house.
* Like Jesus Christ, you are stones that are alive. Like a house builder, God makes from you a house for himself,

**you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house:** There are several ways of understanding this verse part:

1. This is a statement about something that was happening as the believers came to Jesus Christ. The believers were being built into a spiritual house. For example:

    > you yourselves as living stones are built up as a spiritual house (NET) *(BSB, CEV, KJV, NASB, NIV, NLT, GW, NET)*

2. This is a command to the believers to be built into a spiritual house. For example:

    > like living stones, let yourselves be built into a spiritual house (NRSV) *(NCV, REB, NRSV, GNT)*

3. This is a purpose clause. Peter wanted his readers to come to Christ so that they might be built into a spiritual house. For example:

    > so that you…may be built into a spiritual house (NJB) *(NJB)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), which has the support of most English versions and commentators.

**you…are being built:** This is a passive clause. The one who is doing the building is God. In some languages it may be necessary to translate this using an active verb and make the subject explicit:

> God is building you

**you:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *you* is emphasized and may also be translated as:

> you yourselves (NET)

**like living stones:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *like* introduces the role that the believers fill as God is building them into a spiritual temple, the role of *living stones*. Some other ways to translate this metaphor include:

* Keep the metaphor. For example:

    > you are living stones (CEV)

* Translate the metaphor as a simile. For example:

    > You also are like living stones (NCV)

**living stones:** Peter said these Christians were *living* because God had caused them to be born again through his word (1:23\) and given them new life through Jesus Christ rising from death (1:3\).

**stones:** Peter described the believers as *stones* because in that part of the world, people built houses out of *stones*. Christians were like *stones* in the sense that God was using them to build a house for himself.

**spiritual:** In this context the Greek word that the BSB translates as *spiritual* means “non\-material” or “not physical.” It refers to something that cannot be seen by human eyes, something that is in the realm of the divine rather than the human.

**house:** There are two ways of interpreting the Greek word that the BSB translates as *house* here:

1. It means *house*, a building where people live. For example:

    > And now you are living stones that are being used to build a spiritual house. (CEV) *(BSB, CEV, GW, KJV, NASB, NET, NIV, NJB, RSV)*

2. It means temple, a building where people worship God. For example:

    > And you are living stones that God is building into his spiritual temple. (NLT) *(NCV, NLT, REB, GNT)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). In this context, *house* is a metaphor. It illustrates the spiritual truth that God dwells among his people. People who believe in Jesus Christ together form God’s *house*, the church, and God lives in their midst.

If the metaphor of a *house* is not understandable to your readers, then you may need to translate it as a simile:

> You are like a…house

##### **General Comment on 2:5a**

In some languages it may be necessary to make some of the meaning of this metaphor explicit, For example:

> Just as a builder makes houses out of stones, so God is building a spiritual house out of you living stones.

#### 2:5b

**to be a holy priesthood,**

* to be a priesthood dedicated to God
* God also dedicates you to be his group of priests,

**to be a holy priesthood:** Here Peter used another metaphor to describe the Christian church.

**to be:** The Greek preposition that the BSB translates as *to be* is literally “unto.” In this context it communicates that:

1. The spiritual house in 2:5a is what forms the *holy priesthood*. These are two metaphors describing the Christian church, made up of all believers.
2. The spiritual house in 2:5a is for the purpose of the *holy priesthood* offering spiritual sacrifices to God (2:5c).

Some other ways this has been translated include:

> and form a holy priesthood (REB)

> as a holy priesthood (NJB)

> for a holy priesthood

> You are also a group of holy priests (CEV)

**holy priesthood:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *priesthood* occurs only twice in the New Testament, both in this chapter (2:5, 2:9\). It refers to God’s people as a whole. God made the believers as a group into an order of holy priests. Priests are people who approach God to worship him and offer sacrifices.

In your translation, try to make it clear that Peter was referring to the believers as a group, not as individuals. For example:

> a group of holy priests (CEV)

**holy:** In this context, the Greek word that the BSB translates as *holy* refers to someone who is set apart to serve God. God has set the members of this priesthood apart to serve him. He has dedicated them to himself. Some other examples for translating are:

> dedicated to God

> fully serving God

#### 2:5c

**offering spiritual sacrifices**

* and to offer spiritual sacrifices of thanks and praise to God
* in order for you to offer him spiritual sacrifices of worship.

**offering spiritual sacrifices:** The priesthood of believers that Peter wrote about is similar to the Hebrew Old Testament priesthood in that both presented offerings to God.

**spiritual:** As in 2:5a, the Greek word that the BSB translates as *spiritual* means “non\-material.” Peter’s readers were not offering animals as sacrifices. They were offering sacrifices that could not be seen.

**sacrifices:** In this context, the word *sacrifices* is a metaphor. Peter was not really talking about animal *sacrifices* such as the Hebrew priests offered to God during the Old Testament period.A word of caution: Substituting “gifts” for “sacrifices” might result in inadvertent confusion with “spiritual gifts.” If a language has a word such as “offerings” and it would be unambiguous that the giving is from man to God, that would probably be preferable to using a word that functions as “gifts” does in English. Instead, he was referring to giving praises to God and help to those in need. See also Romans 12:1 and Hebrews 13:15–16\.

##### **General Comment on 2:5b–c**

2:5b–c gives the purpose for which God builds the believers into a spiritual house. English translations mark this purpose in three different places:

* Before the mention of the holy priesthood. For example, the BSB says:

    > to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices (BSB)

* Before the mention of the spiritual sacrifices. For example, the NJB says:

    > as a holy priesthood to offer the spiritual sacrifices (NJB)

* At both places. For example, the RSV says:

    > to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices (RSV)

In your translation, mark the purpose at the place where it is most natural in your language.

#### 2:5d

**acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.**

* that God accepts through Jesus Christ.
* These sacrifices please God because of what Jesus Christ has done.

**acceptable to God:** The phrase *acceptable to God* means that God was pleased with the spiritual sacrifices that the believers offered to him. Other ways to say this include:

> God accepts your sacrifices

> These sacrifices please God

**through Jesus Christ:** There are two ways of understanding the relationship of the phrase *through Jesus Christ* to the rest of 2:5c:

1. Through Jesus Christ, the spiritual offerings were acceptable to God. God was pleased to receive these offerings because of what Jesus Christ had done. For example:

    > to offer the spiritual sacrifices made acceptable to God through Jesus Christ (NJB) *(BSB, NIV, KJV, NASB, RSV, REB, NET, GW, NLT, NCV, NJB)*

2. The believers offered spiritual sacrifices through Jesus Christ. For example:

    > with the help of Jesus Christ you will offer sacrifices that please God (CEV) *(GNT, CEV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\) and the majority of English versions.

##### **General Comment on 2:4–5**

In the BSB, as in the Greek, 2:4–5 forms one long sentence. In many languages it may be natural to use several shorter sentences. For example:

> You are coming to Jesus Christ, the living stone. He is the one whom people rejected but God considers valuable and chose. You are also living stones, and God is building you into a spiritual house. As a holy priesthood you offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.

## 1 Peter 2:6 (id: 474517)

### Section 2:1–12: Christ is the cornerstone and believers are his holy people

In this section Peter used illustrations from the Old Testament to describe how important Christ was and how holy Christians should be. Christ was like the most important stone in a building. Christians belong to him and so should live holy lives.

Some other headings for this section are:

> Live as God’s Chosen People (GW)

> A Living Stone and a Holy People (CEV)

### Paragraph 2:4–8

In this paragraph, Peter used a metaphor that compared Jesus Christ to a stone. He quoted three passages from the Old Testament that also used the metaphor of a stone to speak about the Christ whom God had promised to send:

1. In 2:6 Peter quoted from Isaiah 28:16\.
2. In 2:7 Peter quoted from Psalm 118:22\.
3. In 2:8 Peter quoted from Isaiah 8:14\.

#### 2:6

In 2:6, Peter quoted from Isaiah 28:16 in the Old Testament. Isaiah had prophesied about the Christ whom God had promised to send. He had used the metaphor of a “stone” to tell about Jesus Christ long before Peter used this metaphor (2:4\).

#### 2:6a

**For it stands in Scripture:**

* For/As Scripture says:
* That is why in the Holy Writings God said:

**For it stands in Scripture:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *For* here introduces a verse of Scripture that supports what Peter just wrote. You should introduce this Old Testament quote in a way that is natural for you language.

**it stands:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *it stands* is literally “it is contained,” as in the NASB. You may also be able to translate this as:

> For you will find in scripture: (REB)

Isaiah 28:16 quotes God as the speaker. Therefore, you may want to include a reference to God. For example:

> It is just as God says in the Scriptures… (CEV)

Your language may require you to say who wrote the prophecy and whose words he wrote. For example:

> The prophet Isaiah wrote in the Scriptures God’s talk/words that said this would happen

**in Scripture:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Scripture* is used in a special way in the New Testament. It refers to words that God directed someone to write. Such writings had authority because God guided a person to write them. In the New Testament the word *Scripture* almost always refers to something that was written in the Old Testament.

The Scripture from which Peter was quoting is Isaiah 28:16 in the Old Testament. You may translate *Scripture* with the term you use for the Old Testament. If you have a more specific term for the writings of the Old Testament prophets, you may use it here. Some ways to translate the phrase *in Scripture* are:

> God’s written word

> the message of God that they/someone wrote

#### 2:6b

**“See, I lay in Zion a stone,**

* “See, I the Lord am laying a stone in the city of Zion.
* “Listen, I am placing/setting in the city of Zion a stone

**See:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *See* is the first word of Peter’s quotation of Isaiah 28:16\. Its purpose is to catch the attention of the reader. Some other ways to translate this word are:

> Look (NET)

> Behold (RSV)

> Listen to this

Some English versions have not translated this Greek word (GW, NCV, NLT, REB, GNT).

**I lay…a stone:** This is a metaphor. God was speaking as though he were a house builder. He said that he was placing a stone into its correct position in a building. Other ways to say this include:

> I am placing/setting a stone in position

> I am putting a stone into place

The Greek verb is a present tense verb. However, because it is a prophecy concerning Jesus Christ, it may be more natural to translate it as future tense. For example:

> I will put a stone in the ground (NCV)

**a stone:** Peter continued with the metaphor of *a stone* representing Jesus Christ. See 2:4a.

**in Zion:** *Zion* is another name for Jerusalem. Sometimes *Zion* and Jerusalem are used as metaphors to refer to God’s people everywhere, on earth and in heaven. Here Peter used it to refer to the Christian church, believers in Jesus Christ who live on earth or in heaven. Some English versions such as the NLT translate *Zion* as:

> Jerusalem (NLT)

#### 2:6c

**a chosen and precious cornerstone;**

* This is the stone I have chosen to be the cornerstone, and it is valuable/precious.
* of great worth that I have chosen to be the main foundation stone of my house.

**chosen:** The Greek word that is translated by most English versions as “chosen” can also be translated as an adjective with the meaning of “excellent” or “select” or “choice.” This is true at 2:4, but especially at 2:6\. (See the Bauer, Arndt, Gingrich, and Danker Lexicon, *eklektos*). This may have been why the NCV at 2:6 has “this important and precious rock.” The Greek word that the BSB translates as *chosen* is the same as at 2:4b. At 2:4b Peter made it explicit that it was God who chose this stone. Here at 2:6b, God is speaking. If you must make explicit who chose this stone, then here you may be able to say:

> chosen by me

> I chose this stone

**precious:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *precious* is the same as at 2:4b. You will probably want to translate it here the same way as you did at 2:4b. Other ways that the English versions have translated this include:

> valuable (GNT)

> priceless (NET)

> of great worth (REB)

**cornerstone:** A *cornerstone* was a very hard stone that builders carefully shaped to lay at the corner of a foundation. Because the walls would meet at the *cornerstone* and rest on top of it, the *cornerstone* was both a pattern and support for the building.

In the metaphor, Peter is speaking about the *cornerstone* of a “spiritual house” made up of living stones, Christian believers (2:5a). This metaphor represents or illustrates how God appointed Jesus Christ to support and unite the church, the fellowship of all believers. However, you will probably want to retain the metaphor in this quotation, if the grammar of your language allows you to do so naturally.

In some languages there may not be a specific word for a *cornerstone*. If that is the case in your language, some other ways to translate *cornerstone* are:

> the most important stone

> foundation stone

> rock (NCV)

##### **General Comment on 2:6b–c**

In your translation of 2:6b–c, it may be more natural in your language to refer only once to the stone. Instead of saying both “stone” and “cornerstone,” several English versions mention just the cornerstone. For example:

> I am laying a chosen and precious cornerstone in Zion (GW)

> I am laying in Zion a chosen corner\-stone of great worth (REB)

#### 2:6d

**and the one who believes in Him will never be put to shame.”**

* Whoever trusts/believes in him will never be ashamed.”
* No one who relies on him will be disgraced.”

**and the one who believes in Him will never be put to shame:** Peter chose this quotation from Isaiah 28:16 to encourage his readers to remain faithful to Jesus Christ.

It may be more natural in your language to translate 2:6d as a separate sentence. For example:

> Anyone who trusts in him will never be disappointed. (NCV)

**the one who believes in Him:** The phrase *the one who believes in him* refers to anyone and everyone who trusts in Jesus Christ, the cornerstone. Some other ways to translate this include:

> Anyone who trusts (NCV)

> whoever believes (NET)

> Every person who trusts

**believes:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *believes* can also be translated as:

> trusts (NIV)

> has faith (CEV)

> relies (NJB)

**in Him:** There are two ways of interpreting the Greek word that the BSB translates as *in him*:

1. It is masculine. The writer was no longer using a metaphor. He was referring directly to Jesus Christ. For example:

    > whoever believes in him (GNT) *(BSB GW, KJV, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, NLT, RSV, GNT)*

2. It is neuter. The writer was still using the cornerstone metaphor and was referring to this stone. For example:

    > who relies on this (NJB) *(REB, NJB)*

The CEV is ambiguous (“that one”). It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\) as most English versions do.

**will never be put to shame:** There are two ways of interpreting the verb phrase that the BSB translates as *will never be put to shame*:

1. The believers will never be ashamed or disgraced for trusting in Jesus Christ as Savior. For example:

    > will never be ashamed (GW) *(BSB, NET, NIV, NJB, RSV, GW)*

2. The believers will never be disappointed. Jesus Christ will show himself worthy of their trust in him. For example:

    > will never be disappointed (GNT) *(CEV, NASB, NCV, NLT, GNT)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\) if you can do so naturally in your language. It is good to use a word that is the opposite of “honor.” Believers will receive not shame but honor from God.

**never:** The two Greek words that the BSB translates as *never* are two different negative particles/markers. By using them together, Peter said emphatically that his readers would definitely not be ashamed for being Christians.

Another way to state this verse part is:

> No one who has faith in him will be disappointed

### Paragraph 2:4–8

In this paragraph, Peter used a metaphor that compared Jesus Christ to a stone. He quoted three passages from the Old Testament that also used the metaphor of a stone to speak about the Christ whom God had promised to send:

1. In 2:6 Peter quoted from Isaiah 28:16\.
2. In 2:7 Peter quoted from Psalm 118:22\.
3. In 2:8 Peter quoted from Isaiah 8:14\.

#### 2:7–8

In 2:7–8, Peter continued to use the metaphor of a cornerstone for Jesus Christ. He contrasted the positive result for any person who believes in Jesus Christ (2:7a) with the negative result for people who do not believe (2:7b–2:8\). To prove his point, Peter quotes from two OT passages, Psalm 118:22 (in 2:7\) and Isaiah 8:14 (in 2:8\).

#### 2:7a

**To you who believe, then, this stone is precious.**

* So for you people who trust/believe in this stone, it brings honor to you.
* Therefore this stone will give honor to you who rely on him.

**To you who believe, then, this stone is precious:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *precious* can mean either “honor” or “value/worth/preciousness.” The Greek literally says, “to you therefore the honor/value to the believing ones.” English versions interpret this clause in two ways:

1. Believers receive honor from the stone. For example:

    > To you believers it brings honor (NJB) *(GW, NJB, NRSV, ESV)*

2. The stone has value to the believers. It is *precious* to them. Translations that follow this interpretation often supply the words *this stone*, which are not in the Greek text. For example:

    > This stone is of great value for you that believe (GNT) *(BSB, CEV, KJV, NCV, NET, NIV, NLT, REB, RSV, GNT, NABRE, NASB)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). The great majority of commentatorsSee, for example, Bigg, page 131; Michaels, page 104; Selwyn, page 164; Kistemaker, page 89; Marshall, page 72; Grudem, page 104; and Kelly, page 93\. understand this word to mean “honor” in this context. Peter was saying that God honors those who believe in Jesus Christ. The NJB is therefore used as the Source Line in the Display. Here are some other ways to translate this:

> This honor, then, is for you who believe (NRSV)

> This honor belongs to those who believe. (GW)

> So the honor is for you who believe (ESV)

**believe:** In some languages it may be necessary to make the object of the belief explicit. For example:

> believe in this stone

**then:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *then* is literally “therefore.” It is not a time word but connects this sentence with the last part of the quotation in 2:6\. Some English models to follow include:

> So (NET)

> Therefore (RSV)

#### 2:7b

**But to those who do not believe,**

* But as for those people who do not trust/believe in him,
* However, the result will be different for people who will not rely on him, because

**But to those who do not believe:** In 2:7b Peter stopped writing about believers and started writing about people who did *not believe* in Jesus Christ. Through the end of 2:8, Peter discussed what happens to unbelieving people.

Other ways to translate this verse part include:

> But for unbelievers (NJB)

> but for those who have no faith (REB)

> But to/for the people who do not believe in him

**But:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *But* in this context marks contrast. Peter contrasted the bad result of unbelief (2:7b–8\) with what he had just written about the good result for those people who believed in Jesus Christ (2:6c–7a).

**believe:** In some languages it may be necessary to make the object of the belief explicit. If that is the case in your language, it is recommended that you use the same pronoun that you used in 2:6d:

> believe in him

#### 2:7c

**“The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,”**

* the Scripture says: “The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone of the house.”
* God has said in the Holy Writings: “The stone that is now the main foundation stone of my house is the same stone that the builders discarded.”
* God says in the Psalms: “The builders refused to use a certain stone, but I have used it as the most important stone of the building.”

Here in 2:7c, Peter quoted from Psalm 118:22\.

**The stone the builders rejected:** Peter continued using the metaphor of a *stone* to represent Jesus Christ. Here the metaphor is of *builders* who *rejected* this *stone* as if it were unfit for them to use. It may be more natural in your language to make explicit why they *rejected* the *stone*. For example:

> The stone which the builders rejected as worthless (GNT)

Your translation should not imply that *The stone* was actually unfit for use. Peter did not mean there was something wrong with Christ. Instead, Peter meant that there was something wrong with the decision of *the builders*. You may be able to say:

> The builders would not use a certain stone

> The stone that the builders refused to use

**the builders:** Writers of the Gospels also quoted Psalm 118:22\. They too used it as a metaphor concerning Jesus Christ. In their writings, *the builders* represented the religious leaders of the Jews (see Matthew 21:42, Mark 12:10, Luke 20:17\). In Acts 4:11, Peter himself spoke of the Jewish authorities who had Christ killed as *the builders*. In this context, however, *the builders* refers to anyone who rejected Jesus Christ. Some other ways to translate *builders* are:

> workmen

> those who make houses

**rejected:** The Greek verb that the BSB translates as *rejected* is in the past tense. The Old Testament prophets often wrote about a future event as if it had already happened.

When you translate this verb, you should use a tense that is natural for this situation in your language. For some languages, it is natural to use a future tense. For example:

> will reject

A form of this same Greek verb is found at 2:4b. See the note at 2:4b for other ways to translate this verb.

**has become the cornerstone:** Peter continued the metaphor of the stone. Even though the builders rejected this stone, it became *the* most important stone.

Neither Peter nor Psalm 118:22 that Peter quoted said how the rejected stone became so important in the building. If your language requires you to specify an agent, then you may make God explicit as the agent. For example:

> God has made it the capstone

> God used it as the cornerstone of his house

If it is natural in your language to translate 2:7c as a continuation of God talking in 2:6, then you may be able to say:

> I made it the cornerstone

> I used it as the cornerstone of the building

**the cornerstone:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *cornerstone* may be translated literally as “the head of the corner.” There are two ways of interpreting this phrase:

1. It means “the cornerstone.” A cornerstone is a bottom stone where two walls meet. For example:

    > the cornerstone (NCV) *(BSB, GW, NASB, NET, NJB, NLT, REB, NCV)*

2. It means “the capstone.” A capstone is the top stone of a wall or arch. For example:

    > the capstone (NIV) *(NIV, compare RSV “the head of the corner”)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\) and the majority of English versions. See how you translated “cornerstone” in 2:6b.

##### **General Comment on 2:7c**

In some languages it may be more natural to reorder the phrase in 2:7c. Reordering may also make the transition to the quotation in 2:8 more natural. For example:

> The most important stone of all is the one the builders rejected.

> The stone that is now the main foundation stone of my/the house/temple is the same stone that the builders rejected.

### Section 2:1–12: Christ is the cornerstone and believers are his holy people

In this section Peter used illustrations from the Old Testament to describe how important Christ was and how holy Christians should be. Christ was like the most important stone in a building. Christians belong to him and so should live holy lives.

Some other headings for this section are:

> Live as God’s Chosen People (GW)

> A Living Stone and a Holy People (CEV)

### Paragraph 2:4–8

In this paragraph, Peter used a metaphor that compared Jesus Christ to a stone. He quoted three passages from the Old Testament that also used the metaphor of a stone to speak about the Christ whom God had promised to send:

1. In 2:6 Peter quoted from Isaiah 28:16\.
2. In 2:7 Peter quoted from Psalm 118:22\.
3. In 2:8 Peter quoted from Isaiah 8:14\.

#### 2:8

In 2:8, Peter continued to use the rock metaphor for Jesus Christ. Now the metaphor is of a rock that people fall over. Peter used this metaphor to continue his description (started at 2:7b) of the bad things that would happen to people who do not believe in Jesus Christ.

#### 2:8a

**and,**

* And in another place in the Scripture it says,
* And God also said through Isaiah,
* The prophet Isaiah wrote this about unbelievers

**and:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *and* marks what follows in 2:8b as another quotation from the Old Testament. Some versions such as the CEV do not translate this conjunction. You should translate it in a way that is natural for your language.

In some languages it may be helpful to follow the GNT and make this explicit:

> And another scripture says, (GNT)

If your language requires you to say that this quotation is from a different writer, then you may be able to say something like:

> And the prophet Isaiah wrote that to unbelievers Christ/he is

#### 2:8b

**“A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense.”**

* “He is like a stone that people stumble over, like a rock that they fall against.”
* “This/He is a stone/rock that some people stumble over so that they fall.”
* Christ/he is, “a stone in their way/path. They trip and fall over this rock.”

In this verse part Peter continued to portray Jesus Christ as a rock. The collision between unbelievers and this rock results in the downfall of the unbelievers.

**A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense:** 2:8b is a quotation from Isaiah 8:14, which was Hebrew poetry. In Hebrew poetry, the writer often repeated the same or similar idea but in different words. Here the same idea is stated twice.

If repeating ideas like this is unnatural in your language and might communicate a wrong meaning, or if your language has only one word for both *stone* and *rock*, then you may say something like:

> He is a stone/rock that people stumble over so that they fall.

The Greek phrases that the BSB translates as *A stone of stumbling* and *a rock of offense* are literally “a stone of stumbling” and “a rock of falling.” The text does not use any verbs. As it is speaking about something that was future to the Old Testament writer, another possible translation model is:

> This is the stone that will make people stumble, the rock that will make them fall. (GNT)

**stone…rock:** Some scholars see a difference in meaning between the two Greek words that the BSB translates as *stone* and *rock*. The word *rock* may refer to something larger than a *stone*. It could mean bedrock or a boulder or rocky crag.

If you follow the style of Hebrew poetry to translate 2:8b, you will need two words such as *stone* and *rock*. For the first, you will want a word that can mean a *stone* people might use for building, perhaps cut or shaped to size. For the second, you may use a word that can mean a *rock* that is relatively larger than the building stone.

**of offense:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *of offense* can also be translated as:

> to trip people up (NJB)

> to trip over (NET)

Consider the most natural way to express this in your language.

#### 2:8c

**They stumble because they disobey the word—**

* These people stumble because they do not obey the message from God.
* The reason that people stumble on this stone is because they refuse to obey God’s message/word.
* It is because they disobey God by refusing to believe the message/word about Jesus Christ that they stumble.

**They:** *They* is a pronoun that Peter is using to refer to the people whom he mentioned at 2:7a. *They* were the people who did not trust/believe in Jesus Christ.

**stumble:** In 2:8b, Peter used the word “stumbling,” which is noun form of the Greek verb that the BSB translates as *stumble* here. Some English versions translate the verb here as:

> trip (REB)

**they disobey the word:** There are two ways of understanding the Greek word that the BSB translates as *disobey*:

1. It means disobey. These people do not obey the word/message. For example:

    > they do not obey what God says (NCV) *(BSB, NASB, CEV, KJV, NET, NIV, RSV, NCV)*

2. It means disbelieve. These people do not believe the word. For example:

    > they refuse to believe the word (REB) *(GW, NJB, GNT, REB)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).The NLT is not listed because it translates both of the options: “they do not listen to God’s word or obey it.” However, Peter was probably implying that the disobedience consisted of not believing what God said about Jesus. In some languages it may be natural to make this explicit. For example:

> they disobey God by refusing to believe the message about Jesus Christ

**the word:** The Greek term that the BSB translates as *word* had a very broad meaning. It could refer to almost anything that was said. The correct interpretation had to be understood from the context.

There are two ways of interpreting the term here:

1. It refers to a word or *message*, perhaps concerning the Good News about salvation through Jesus Christ. For example:

    > They stumble because they disobey the message (NIV) *(BSB, NIV, CEV, NASB, NCV, NET, NLT, RSV)*

2. It is another metaphor for Jesus Christ. This is indicated either by capitalizing the “W” of word, and/or by using the pronoun “in.” For example:

    > they do not believe in the Word (NJB) *(GNT, NJB)*

It is recommend that you follow interpretation (1\) as most English versions do.

#### 2:8d

**and to this they were appointed.**

* This then is their fate/destiny.
* Therefore, this will certainly happen to them.
* God decided/determined that people who disobey the word/message will/must stumble like this.

**and to this they were appointed:** There are two ways of interpreting the phrase *to this they were appointed*:

1. The unbelievers *were appointed* to stumble because of their disobedience/unbelief.Another way to say this is: As a consequence of their disobedience to the word, the destiny of unbelievers is to stumble/fall. This is what God has in store for unbelievers in general, and for the individual unbeliever whose attitude and actions were known to God from the beginning. In other words, God planned or decided that the people who disobeyed the word would stumble. For example:

    > They stumble because they do not obey what God says, which is what God planned to happen to them. (NCV) *(NJB, NLT, GW, NCV; probably NASB, REB)*

2. The unbelievers *were destined* to disobey/disbelieve the word and therefore to stumble. For example:

    > They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do. (NET) *(probably KJV, RSV, NET, CEV)*

The BSB, NIV, and GNT leave both possibilities open. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), which has the support of most commentaries.

**they were appointed:** This is a passive clause. If it is more natural in your language to use an active verb, it may be necessary to make the implied subject “God” explicit:

> God destined them

> God determined/decided would happen to them

> God said this must certainly happen to them

Some other ways that the English versions have translated the Greek verb that the BSB translates as *they were appointed* include:

> the fate in store for them (NJB)

> the fate appointed for them (REB)

> they were doomed (CEV)

### Paragraph 2:9–10

In this paragraph, Peter described the honorable status that God had given his readers. He used titles that OT writers had used to speak of the people of Israel.For examples, see Exodus 19:5–6; 23:22 (LXX); Deuteronomy 4:20, 7:6, 14:2; Isaiah 43:20–21\. Many of Peter’s readers were not Jews. Peter meant that all believers, whether Jew or Gentile, are now united as God’s chosen people.

#### 2:9a

**But you are a chosen people,**

* ¶ But as for you, you are a people/race chosen by God.
* ¶ But you are different from them. God chose you who believe to be his tribe/group.
* ¶ However, God selected/picked you to make you his people,

**But you are:** The Greek words that the BSB translates as *But you are* mark a contrast between the fate of unbelievers and the honor that God gives believers. Other ways you may be able to show this contrast include:

> But as for you, you are…

> But you are different from them. You who believe are…

**a chosen people:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *people* often refers to a distinct large group of *people* who are related to each other by a blood relationship. Believers are not literally one race, but they are spiritually brothers and sisters, in that God is their heavenly Father.

Many English versions have translated *people* as “race.” For example:

> a chosen race (RSV)

**chosen:** The Greek word that the BSB translates here as *chosen*Peter used a form of *eklektos* in 1:1, but the context is different. is also found at 2:4b and 2:6c. It is a passive verb. If in your language you must use an active verb and say who did the choosing, then you may make it explicit that it is God who chooses his *people*. For example:

> But you are God’s chosen…people. (CEV)

> You, however, are the people God has chosen.

> But you are different. God chose you.

#### 2:9b

**a royal priesthood,**

* You are a royal order of priests.
* You are a priesthood that belongs to God the king.
* a group of priests who serve God the king,

**a royal priesthood:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *royal* may be translated as:

1. an adjective, meaning *royal*, or belonging to the king. For example:

    > the King’s priests (GNT) *(BSB, GW, NCV, CEV, KJV, NASB, NET, NIV, REB, RSV, GNT)*

2. a noun, meaning kingdom. The believers are priests who together form a nation ruled by a king. For example:

    > a kingdom of priests (NJB) *(NLT, NJB)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\) as most English versions do. The *priesthood* is *royal* in the sense that it belongs to or serves the king, who is God.

**priesthood:** The Greek word that the BSB translates here as *priesthood* occurs in only one other place in the New Testament, at 2:5b. See how you translated it there. It is recommended that you also translate it here in a way that shows that the believers together form a *priesthood*.

#### 2:9c

**a holy nation,**

* You are a holy nation,
* You are a nation that God has set apart as his own.
* a nation/people he dedicated to serve him,

**a holy nation:** Peter continued to describe the church in terms borrowed from the Old Testament. Like the people of Israel in the Old Testament, all believers in Christ together form *a holy nation*.

**holy:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *holy* here means “set apart for God” or “dedicated to God.” God chose believers to be in fellowship with him, dedicated to serve him willingly. See how you translated *holy* in 1:15 and 1:16\. Here is another way to translate this word:

> dedicated (REB)

**nation:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *nation* is different from the one translated as “people” or “race” in 2:9a. However, these two Greek words had a similar meaning. A *nation* was a group of people linked or united by language or culture or race.

#### 2:9d

**a people for God’s own possession,**

* a people that belongs to God.
* You are God’s very own people.
* to belong just/only to God.

**a people for God’s own possession:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *a people for God’s own possession* is literally “a people for possession.” The BSB has supplied the word *God* in order to make the meaning clear. Some English translations simply supply the pronoun “his”:

> a people of his own (NET)

**a people:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *a people* is similar in meaning to the words translated as “people” in 2:9a and “nation” in 2:9c. You should use the word in your language that is most accurate and natural, even if it is one of the words that you have already used in this verse.

#### 2:9e

**to proclaim the virtues of Him**

* He/God did this so that you would tell other people about the wonderful things he did for you.
* He/God chose you to be his people so that you would make known his great deeds/acts.

**to:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *to* introduces the purpose for which God chose Christians to be his own holy people. Some ways to translate this include:

> in order that… (NRSV)

> You were chosen to… (NCV)

> so that… (NET)

**proclaim the virtues of Him:** God chose the believers and made of them a priesthood and holy nation for a purpose. He intended them to tell other people the wonderful things that God has done.

**proclaim:** The Greek verb that the BSB translates as *proclaim* can also be translated as:

> make known

> declare (NIV)

> tell (CEV)

Your language may require you to say to whom the believers were to make these things known. In that case you may be able to say:

> for you to make known to people

> for you to tell other people

**the virtues of Him:** There are several ways to interpret the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *the virtues of Him*:

1. It refers to the wonderful things that God has done. For example:

    > the wonderful acts of God (GNT) *(CEV, NCV, RSV, REB, GNT)*

2. It refers to the virtues or excellencies of God, the attributes of God. For example:

    > the excellent qualities of God (GW) *(BSB, NASB, NLT, NET, GW)*

3. It refers to the words of praise spoken about God by his people. For example:

    > the praises of God (NJB) *(KJV, NIV, NJB)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), which has the support of leading commentaries.

#### 2:9f

**who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.**

* He called/brought you out of the dark to live in his wonderful/marvellous light.
* You are to tell others about how he summoned/led you out of the darkness of sin and death and into his amazing light/brightness.

**who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light:** Peter was referring to God. God is the one *who called* Peter’s readers *out of darkness* and *into…light*. This is one of the wonderful deeds for which Peter’s readers were to praise him. In some languages it may be natural to make this explicit. You may want to begin a new sentence here:

> For God called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.

**called:** If in your language a verb like *called* is unnatural in this context, then you may be able to say something like:

> brought (CEV)

> summoned

> led

**darkness:** Here, *darkness* is a metaphor representing the miserable condition of unbelievers because of their sinfulness. Peter’s readers were in that *darkness* before they became reconciled to God through Jesus Christ. By believing in Jesus Christ as their Savior, they moved out of the *darkness* of sin and into the *light* of God. Another way to translate this is:

> spiritual darkness

**marvelous:** Other ways to translate the Greek word that the BSB translates as *marvelous* include:

> wonderful (NIV)

> amazing (JBP)

**light:** Here, *light* is a metaphor for the goodness, purity and truth that come from God. Another way to translate this is:

> spiritual light

##### **General Comment on 2:9**

It may be more natural in your language to make explicit that each of the phrases in 2:9 identifies the believers as being God’s people. For example, the JBP shows this by making explicit that they are “his”:

> But you are God’s “chosen generation,” his “royal priesthood,” his “holy nation,” his “peculiar people”…. It is for you now to demonstrate the goodness of him who has called you out of darkness into his amazing light. (Underlining added.)

## 1 Peter 2:10 (id: 474521)

### Section 2:1–12: Christ is the cornerstone and believers are his holy people

In this section Peter used illustrations from the Old Testament to describe how important Christ was and how holy Christians should be. Christ was like the most important stone in a building. Christians belong to him and so should live holy lives.

Some other headings for this section are:

> Live as God’s Chosen People (GW)

> A Living Stone and a Holy People (CEV)

### Paragraph 2:9–10

In this paragraph, Peter described the honorable status that God had given his readers. He used titles that OT writers had used to speak of the people of Israel.For examples, see Exodus 19:5–6; 23:22 (LXX); Deuteronomy 4:20, 7:6, 14:2; Isaiah 43:20–21\. Many of Peter’s readers were not Jews. Peter meant that all believers, whether Jew or Gentile, are now united as God’s chosen people.

#### 2:10

In this verse,For background to this verse, see Hosea 1:6, 9 and 2:1, 23\. Peter continued identifying his Christian readers as God’s people. Here he referred to the description of the children of Israel from Hosea 2:23 to describe believers in Christ.

Most English versions do not mark this verse as a quotation. The NLT and CEV, however, place this verse in quotation marks. The CEV identifies it (at the end of 2:9\) as being from the Scriptures by saying:

> The Scriptures say… (CEV)

Introduce this verse in a way that sounds natural in your language. You may wish to note in a footnote that it is taken from Hosea 2:23\. It is not a direct quotation.

#### 2:10a

**Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God;**

* Formerly, you were not even a people, but now you are God’s own people.
* In the past, you did not belong together as a people group. Now you belong to the people of God.

**Once:** The word *Once* refers to the time period before these Gentile believers became part of the group identified as God’s people. Other ways to say this include:

> In the past

> At one time (NCV)

**not a people:** This phrase has been interpreted in different ways:

1. Before they became believers, Peter’s readers had no common identity. They were not a community, a distinct people group. For example:

    > you were not a people at all (REB) *(BSB, KJV, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, NLT, RSV, CEV, NJB, REB)*

2. Before they became believers, Peter’s readers were not God’s people. For example:

    > you were not God’s people (GNT) *(GW, GNT)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\) as most English versions do.

**people:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *people* twice in this verse is the same word as at 2:9d. These are the only places in this letter where Peter used this Greek word.

This word referred to a distinct group of related *people*. It could refer to an ethnic group, such as the Old Testament *people* of Israel.

**but:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *but* introduces a contrast between the past and the present. Express this contrast in a way that is natural for your language.

**now:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *now* in this context means “ever since you became Christians.” It refers to the state of things at the time when Peter was writing.

**you are the people of God:** Peter said that his readers had become a people, a community, and that they as a community belonged to God.

#### 2:10b

**once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.**

* Then, you did not have God’s mercy, but now you have it.
* In the past, you had not experienced God’s kindness to you. Now you know that he has been kind to you.
* At that time God had not been merciful to you, but now he has been merciful to you.

**once:** As in 2:10a, the term *once* refers to the time period before Peter’s readers had become Christians.

**you had not received mercy…have received mercy:** Peter gave another description of Gentile Christians, including his Gentile readers. Before God demonstrated that Gentiles, as well as Jews, could be his people, these Gentile Christians *had not* experienced God’s *mercy*.

In some languages it may not be possible to translate *mercy* as an abstract noun. Instead you may need to use an adjective or verb and make the subject God explicit:

> God had not been merciful to you…has been merciful to you

> God had not forgiven you…has forgiven you

**had not received mercy:** The Greek word that the BSB translates here as *had not received mercy* is a perfect tense verb. You may be able to translate this to show that this was an ongoing state or condition in the past. For example:

> In the past you had never received mercy (NCV)

> In the past you had no experience of his mercy (JBP)

> Once you were outside his mercy (REB)

**but:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *but* again introduces a contrast between the past and the present.

**now you have received mercy:** Peter knew that his readers had at some time in the recent past received mercy from God. Now they were living as forgiven people, people who had received mercy.

**mercy:** The word *mercy* means compassion for those who suffer or are in need. Some other ways this word can be translated include:

> pity (NJB)

> kindness (CEV)

* **Associated Passages:** 1PE 2:10

## 1 Peter 2:11 (id: 474522)

### Section 2:1–12: Christ is the cornerstone and believers are his holy people

In this section Peter used illustrations from the Old Testament to describe how important Christ was and how holy Christians should be. Christ was like the most important stone in a building. Christians belong to him and so should live holy lives.

Some other headings for this section are:

> Live as God’s Chosen People (GW)

> A Living Stone and a Holy People (CEV)

#### 2:11a

**Beloved, I urge you, as foreigners and exiles,**

* ¶ Dear ones, you are foreigners and exiles in this world. So I appeal to you
* ¶ My friends, remember that you are living in exile here and this world is not your true home/village. So, I strongly/earnestly encourage/ask you

**Beloved:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Beloved* was a common way for a letter writer to address his readers. It expressed his affection for them. It does not imply that Peter actually knew them personally as individuals. Some other ways *Beloved* can be translated include:

> Dear ones

> you whom I love

> my friends (GNT)

**I urge you:** The Greek verb that the BSB translates as *urge* means to ask very strongly or to earnestly recommend someone to do something. Other ways to translate this include:

> I beg you

> I beseech you

> I appeal to you (REB)

**as foreigners and exiles:** Peter reminds his readers again (see 1:1, 1:17\) that this world is not their real home, so they are living here as *foreigners and exiles*.

Commentators agree that in this context *foreigners* means much the same things as *exiles*. The two words are used together as a stylistic device to emphasize what Peter is saying. Some English translations therefore combine them. For example:

> as aliens in a foreign land (REB)

**foreigners:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *foreigners* is related to the word that it translates as “foreigners” in 1:17c. It refers to someone who is living temporarily in a country of which he is not a citizen.

**exiles:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *exiles* is the same as that in 1:1c. It again refers to someone living in a land that is not his own. See how you translated this word in 1:1c.

Some other ways *foreigners* and *exiles* can be translated include:

> temporary residents and foreigners (NLT)

> strangers and refugees (GNT)

> aliens and exiles (RSV)

##### **General Comment on 2:11a**

The fact that the believers were foreigners and exiles is the ground for the appeal. So in some languages it may be helpful to say:

> …you are foreigners and strangers on this earth. So I beg you… (CEV)

> …you are foreigners and aliens here. So I warn you… (NLT)

#### 2:11b

**to abstain from the desires of the flesh,**

* to refuse/reject the bad desires/appetites of your human nature.
* to not do the bad things that you feel like doing,

**to abstain from the desires of the flesh:** The word *abstain* means to hold oneself back from doing something.

So the phrase *to abstain from the desires of the flesh* means “not to do things you want to do that are wrong” or “to avoid doing the things that your sinful human nature wants to do.”

**from the desires of the flesh:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *the desires of the flesh* is literally “fleshly desires.” The adjective “fleshly,” that is, “of the flesh,” refers in this context to the human nature that tends towards sin. “Flesh” is here contrasted with the “soul,” which is the immortal and spiritual part of man that desires to do God’s will.

If possible, do not translate “flesh” as “body.” It is true that sinful actions are done with our bodies, but our minds and hearts are involved as well (Mark 7:21\).

Other ways to say this phrase include:

> to keep away from fleshly desires (NET)

> not to surrender to sinful desires

> avoid doing the bad things you want to do

#### 2:11c

**which war against your soul.**

* Those bad desires fight/struggle against your spiritual self/life.
* because those things are your enemies.

**which war against your soul:** This is a figure of speech. Peter was saying that all sinful desires are like enemies that are fighting against the believer’s soul.

**your soul:** The *soul* is the real person/individual, as in 1:9\. It is the person who has been rescued for eternal life. This life is threatened by the desires of the unredeemed human nature.

Other ways of saying this include:

> that attack the soul (NJB)

> that battle your soul

> those desires that fight against you (CEV)

* **Associated Passages:** 1PE 2:11

## 1 Peter 2:12 (id: 474523)

### Section 2:1–12: Christ is the cornerstone and believers are his holy people

In this section Peter used illustrations from the Old Testament to describe how important Christ was and how holy Christians should be. Christ was like the most important stone in a building. Christians belong to him and so should live holy lives.

Some other headings for this section are:

> Live as God’s Chosen People (GW)

> A Living Stone and a Holy People (CEV)

#### 2:12a–c

Most of Peter’s readers’ neighbors were not Christians. They would watch how the Christians behaved. Peter wanted his readers to behave so well that their unbelieving neighbors would eventually recognize they were good people and praise God for them. Compare the teaching of Jesus in Matthew 5:16\.

#### 2:12a

**Conduct yourselves with such honor among the Gentiles that,**

* Let your conduct/behavior among unbelievers be so good/upright that
* Behave so well as you live among your pagan neighbours that
* Conduct yourselves righteously in the sight of the people who do not know God.

**Conduct yourselves with such honor among the Gentiles:** Peter wanted the believers to behave in a way that others could see to be righteous. He was talking about their public, outward behavior. A similar expression is found in 1:17c. Another translation suggestion is:

> Let your conduct among unbelievers be so good (REB)

**the Gentiles:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Gentiles* was used by the Jews to refer to non\-Jews, people who did not worship the one true God. If there is an expression in your language for people who worship false gods, you could use that here. Some other ways to translate this word are:

> unbelievers (GW)

> unbelieving neighbors (NLT)

> non\-Christians (NET)

#### 2:12b

**though they slander you as evildoers,**

* even though they say you are people who do bad things
* If you do this, even though they make false accusations against you,

**though they slander you as evildoers:** There are two ways of understanding the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *though they slander you as evildoers*:

1. It assumes and asserts that people were making accusations. For example:

    > when they accuse you of being evildoers (GNT) *(BSB, NRSV, NIV, KJV, NASB, NJB, NET, GW, REB, GNT)*

2. It suggests that people might make accusations. For example:

    > Even if they accuse you of doing wrong (NLT) *(RSV, CEV, NCV, NLT)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). Peter was assuming that some of the pagans were actually saying that the Christians were doing evil things.

**slander:** Peter was speaking about false accusations. The pagans were saying that the believers had done things that they had not done. In your translation, you may need to make it explicit that these accusations were false. One way to do this is to use a word that means “speak falsely against someone.” For example:

> malign (REB)

> falsely accuse

#### 2:12c

**they may see your good deeds and glorify God**

* they may perhaps see the good things you do, and they may praise God
* still, when they see your good behavior, they will have to give God honour/praise

**they may see your good deeds and glorify God:** The Greek clause that the BSB translates as *they may see your good deeds and glorify God* is literally “by observing your good deeds they may glorify God.” The purpose for living good lives (2:2a) is that the pagans would glorify God.

**see your good deeds:** In some languages it may be natural to translate *deeds* as a phrase with a verb:

> see the good things you do

> see you do good things

**see:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *see* means “observe closely.” If you have more than one word for *see* in your language, choose the one that means to watch someone or something attentively.

**and glorify God:** The word *glorify* means to give glory, praise, and honor to someone or something. In this context, Peter is saying that even unbelievers will give glory/praise to God in the future. Some other ways to translate glorify God are:

> praise God (GW)

> give honor to God (NLT)

#### 2:12d

**on the day He visits us.**

* at the time when he will come to us/them.
* when he comes to judge people.

**on the day He visits us:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *on the day he visits us* is literally “on the day of visitation.” The BSB has supplied the information that it was God who was going to visit.

**the day:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *the day* does not necessarily refer to one specific twenty\-four hour day. It likely has the more general meaning of “time” or “occasion.” In some languages it may therefore be best to follow the model of the NET:

> when he appears (NET)

**He visits us:** In the Old Testament, the “day of visitation” was a time when God came to people to investigate their conduct. It resulted either in punishment (Isaiah 10:3\) or blessing (Genesis 50:24\). It is better not to say which it was here. God was going to intervene directly in human affairs. It would be a time of blessing for some and of judgment for others. Some other ways *He visits us* has been translated include:

> he judges the world (NLT)

> the Day of his coming (GNT)

> when he comes to judge (NRSV)

The BSB has also supplied the pronoun *us*. It is also possible to translate this as “on the day he visits them.” If you must supply an object pronoun, use one that is as general as possible. Most English translations avoid supplying such a pronoun by using a verb that does not require an object. For example:

> on the day when Christ comes again (NCV)

##### **General Comment on 2:12**

In the Greek, as in the BSB, 2:12 is one long sentence. In some languages it may be natural to translate this as two or more sentences. For example:

> 12aYou should live righteously among your pagan neighbors. 12bIt is true that they have made false accusations against you. 12cBut when they see the good things you do, they will glorify God 12don the day when he appears.

## 1 Peter 2:13 (id: 474524)

### Section 2:13–25: God’s people should respect the rulers/chiefs of this world

In this section Peter explained in what way his readers should live good lives among their pagan neighbors. They should respect and obey their rulers, including those who ruled locally in the village or town and those who ruled the country. They should also respect and obey the chief ruler of all, the emperor of Rome. God had given these people authority to punish people who do evil and praise those who do good.

Some other headings for this section are:

> Respect the Authority of Others (GW)

> Submission to Rulers and Masters (NIV)

#### 2:13a

**Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human institution,**

* ¶ Please/Honour the Lord by submitting to all human authorities/rulers,
* ¶ Since you are people of the Lord Jesus Christ, you must obey all people who have authority over you.

**Submit yourselves…to:** The Greek verb that the BSB translates as *Submit yourselves…to* means to recognize someone else’s authority. It is to accept their legal position and to act respectfully, as a subordinate. This would normally imply obeying their orders. Other translation suggestions include:

> accept the authority of (NRSV)

> place yourself under the authority of (GW)

**for the Lord’s sake:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *for the Lord’s sake* means “because of the Lord (Jesus Christ).” Peter wanted his readers to act in a way that would both please and honor the Lord. In your translation, you may need to focus on one of these aspects. For example:

> the Lord wants you to… (CEV)

> to please the Lord (GW)

> to honor the Lord

**every human institution:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *every human institution* probably means “human authority.” This is the only time this Greek word that literally means “creation” is used in this way in the New Testament. The phrase has also been translated as:

> human institution (RSV)

> human authority (GNT)

Peter was referring to all people who have authority over others, whether in a single household, locally in a village or town, or in the whole country.

#### 2:13b

**whether to the king as the supreme authority,**

* including the emperor, for he is the highest authority,
* Obey the emperor, who rules all people.

**the king:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *king* here refers to the emperor, the head of the Roman Empire, who had power over all other government officials. Here is another way to translate this noun:

> emperor (REB)

**as the supreme authority:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *as the supreme authority* indicates both that the king was the supreme authority and that this was the reason why people should be subject to him.

**the supreme authority:** The word *supreme* means “highest in authority or rank.” The emperor had power over all other rulers in the Roman Empire. There was no one with the legal right to oppose him. Some other ways to translate this include:

> who rules over everyone (CEV)

> who is the highest authority (NCV)

### Section 2:13–25: God’s people should respect the rulers/chiefs of this world

In this section Peter explained in what way his readers should live good lives among their pagan neighbors. They should respect and obey their rulers, including those who ruled locally in the village or town and those who ruled the country. They should also respect and obey the chief ruler of all, the emperor of Rome. God had given these people authority to punish people who do evil and praise those who do good.

Some other headings for this section are:

> Respect the Authority of Others (GW)

> Submission to Rulers and Masters (NIV)

#### 2:14a

**or to governors as those sent by him**

* and the governors, because he sends them
* Obey also the provincial/local rulers whom he has appointed.

**or:** Peter wanted his readers to be subject to both the king and his governors. So in some languages it may be more natural to say:

> and

**governors:** The word *governors* refers to officials whom the emperor put in charge of areas or provinces. As his representatives, they acted as the highest magistrates in the districts where they served.They were known by the titles of legates, procurators, and proconsuls.

**as those sent by him:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *as those sent by him* suggests that the governors were the emperor’s representatives and that this was the reason why people should be subject to them. Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> as his deputies (REB)

This is a passive clause. In some languages it may be natural to translate it as active:

> whom he sends/appoints

#### 2:14b

**to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do right.**

* to punish evildoers/criminals and praise people who do good.
* Their purpose is to discipline/judge evil people and to speak well of good people.

This verse part gives two reasons why the emperor appointed governors. It makes clear what the emperor wanted the governors to do.

**to punish those who do wrong:** This clause refers to the legal treatment of criminals. Use terms appropriate for a judge sentencing lawbreakers. Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> punish criminals (CEV)

**to praise those who do right:** Peter expected that civil rulers would recognize and approve of good deeds. Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> praise good citizens (CEV)

#### 2:15

Peter wanted the Christians to behave so well that their unbelieving neighbors would not be able to criticize them.

In some languages it may be natural to break this verse up into two sentences. For example:

> For it is God’s will that you should do good. In this way you will silence the ignorant talk of foolish men.

#### 2:15a

**For it is God’s will that**

* For God wants you
* Because God’s desires that

**For:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *For* here means “because.” It introduces the reason why the believers should submit to their civil rulers.

**it is God’s will that:** The phrase *God’s will* here refers to the thing that God wants to happen. In some languages it may be necessary to translate *God’s will* with a verb phrase. Here is another way to translate this:

> for God wants you to… (NET)

#### 2:15b

**by doing good**

* to do good, so that
* your good lives/deeds

**by doing good:** This is the means by which God’s will could be carried out. In some languages it may be natural to say something like:

> you should do good and so…

**doing good:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *doing good* is from the same word that is translated as “those who do right” in 2:14b. The BSB has changed from “right” to *good* for the sake of variety, in accordance with good English style. In your translation, use the same or a different word according to what is most natural in your language.

#### 2:15c

**you should silence the ignorance of foolish men.**

* foolish and ignorant people will stop talking against you.
* should silence those senseless people who criticise you without knowing the truth.

**you should silence the ignorance of foolish men:** The BSB translates the Greek phrase literally here by saying *silence the ignorance*. The RSV says similarly “you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men.” But in many languages, neither “ignorance” nor “ignorant talk” (NIV, GNT) may be things that can be silenced. It may be more natural to speak of silencing people. For example:

> make foolish people stop saying such ignorant things

> silence foolish and ignorant people

**you should silence:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *you should silence* in this context refers to making it morally impossible rather than physically impossible for people to say bad things. The truth should be so obvious that people would be ashamed to keep talking badly about the believers. Other ways to translate this include:

> you should cause those foolish people to fall silent

> you should make it impossible for foolish people to say…

**the ignorance:** By *ignorance*, the BSB is actually referring to speech that is not based on knowledge of the facts. The person who is speaking does not know the truth. So in some languages it may be necessary to translate this as:

> the talk/words of ignorant people

It is implied that what these people were saying was false and that they were saying bad things about the believers. In some languages it may be necessary to make this explicit:

> the false things that ignorant people are saying about you

**foolish men:** The word *foolish* means lacking good sense.

**men:** Here the Greek word that the BSB translates as *men* means people in general and refers to anyone who was speaking evil about believers.

##### **General Comment on 2:15a–c**

In some languages it may be natural to reverse the order of verse parts b and c. For example:

> 15aFor it is God’s will that 15cyou should cause foolish people to stop saying wrong things about you. 15bYou can do this by doing good/right.

> For God wants you to silence the ignorant talk of foolish people by the good things you do. (GNT)

> God wants you to silence stupid and ignorant people by doing right. (CEV)

### Section 2:13–25: God’s people should respect the rulers/chiefs of this world

In this section Peter explained in what way his readers should live good lives among their pagan neighbors. They should respect and obey their rulers, including those who ruled locally in the village or town and those who ruled the country. They should also respect and obey the chief ruler of all, the emperor of Rome. God had given these people authority to punish people who do evil and praise those who do good.

Some other headings for this section are:

> Respect the Authority of Others (GW)

> Submission to Rulers and Masters (NIV)

#### 2:16a

**Live in freedom,**

* Rather live as people whom Christ has made free,
* Behave in the way which is fitting for free people who are no longer enslaved to others.

**Live in freedom:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *Live in freedom* is literally “as free people.” The BSB has supplied the word *Live*. It is also possible to supply a word meaning “Act” (as in the NASB). Peter meant that his readers should consider themselves to be free and conduct themselves in a way that is appropriate for free people.

**freedom:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *freedom* is the opposite of “slavery” and describes the state of “not being under the control of others.” In one sense, this is a metaphor. Many of the believers were, in fact, slaves. But the believers were free inwardly and spiritually. They were free to judge what was right and good. They were free from having to sin and from the pagan customs of their ancestors (see 1:18\). Christ had set them free from those things.

Some other ways to translate this clause include:

> Live as free people (NCV)

> Live as those who are free (REB)

#### 2:16b

**but do not use your freedom as a cover\-up for evil;**

* but being free is not an excuse for doing evil.
* This means that you should not think that as a result of this you can do evil.
* Do not try to hide sin under the cloak/guise of freedom.

**but:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *but* and the RSV as “yet” here introduces a limitation to the previous idea. Some English versions do not translate this conjunction. Introduce this limitation in a way that is natural for your language.

**do not use your freedom as a cover\-up for evil:** Peter was concerned that his readers might misunderstand what he had said about being free, He emphasized that being free did not mean that they were free to do wrong.

In some languages *freedom* may not be something that a person can *use*. So you may need to translate it in one of these ways:

> the fact that you are free is not an excuse for doing evil

> do not try to cover/veil your sin by saying that you are free

**cover\-up:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *cover\-up* is literally “cloak.” Here it refers to something that is used to hide something else. Think whether there is an idiomatic expression in your language for a *cover\-up*, that is, something good that is used to hide an evil deed. Other translations include:

> pretext (NET)

> excuse (NCV)

#### 2:16c

**live as servants of God.**

* Live as people who want to serve God.
* Behave in the way that is fitting for servants of God.

**live as servants of God:** Peter was calling on the believers to realize that they must obey God above anyone else. They must try to please him. As in 2:16a, the BSB has supplied the word *live*.

**servants:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *servants* referred to people who were not free to leave their employment. The idea is the opposite of being “in freedom,” as 2:16a says. In some languages it may be most accurate to translate this as:

> slaves

##### **General Comment on 2:16a–c**

In some languages it may be natural to reverse the order of 2:16b and 16c:

> 16aYou are free, 16bbut still you are God’s servants, 16cand you must not use your freedom as an excuse for doing wrong (CEV)

### Section 2:13–25: God’s people should respect the rulers/chiefs of this world

In this section Peter explained in what way his readers should live good lives among their pagan neighbors. They should respect and obey their rulers, including those who ruled locally in the village or town and those who ruled the country. They should also respect and obey the chief ruler of all, the emperor of Rome. God had given these people authority to punish people who do evil and praise those who do good.

Some other headings for this section are:

> Respect the Authority of Others (GW)

> Submission to Rulers and Masters (NIV)

#### 2:17a–d

Commentators do not agree about how the four commands in this verse relate to each other:

1. There are four separate commands. The same punctuation should therefore separate the commands. For example:

    > Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the emperor. (RSV) *(KJV, NJB, NASB, GNT, GW, NET, NLT, CEV, RSV)*

2. The first command is a summary of the other three. This is shown by a colon at the end of 2:17a. For example:

    > Give due honor to everyone: love your fellow\-Christians, reverence God, honor the emperor. (REB) *(BSB, NIV, NCV, REB)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\) and the majority of English versions.

#### 2:17a

**Treat everyone with high regard:**

* Honour all people,
* Give due regard/deference to everyone.

**Treat everyone with high regard:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Treat…with high regard* is literally “honor.” Believers are to honor all people. Some other ways this clause has been translated are:

> Give due honor to everyone (REB)

> Honor all people (NET)

#### 2:17b

**Love the brotherhood of believers,**

* and love your fellow\-believers.
* Love the family of believers. (NRSV)

**Love the brotherhood of believers:** The word *Love* refers to a strong feeling of affection and concern for a person. Use a natural expression or idiom for this word.

**the brotherhood of believers:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *the brotherhood of believers* is literally “the brotherhood.” The BSB has supplied the words *of believers* to make it explicit that Peter was not talking about a human family. He was referring to the members of the church, all Christians. They were a brotherhood in the sense that God was their heavenly father. It is also possible to translate this as:

> your brothers and sisters in Christ

> your brothers and sisters in the faith (GW)

#### 2:17c

**fear God,**

* Respect God very much,
* Hold God in awe/reverence,
* Be in awe of God,

**fear God:** The phrase *fear God* means to hold God in awe or to respect God. See how you translated the same word occurring as a noun in 1:17c.

#### 2:17d

**honor the king.**

* and honour the great/high king.
* and show/give honour to the Roman emperor.

**honor the king:** See how you translated the phrase “high regard,” which is literally “honor,” in 2:17a.

**the king:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *king* here refers to the Roman emperor, as in 2:13b.

They should respect and obey their rulers, including those who ruled locally in the village or town and those who ruled the country.

Some other headings for this section are:

### Paragraph 2:18–25

Peter now deals with how Christian slaves should behave. The slaves must respect and obey their masters, even if their masters treat them harshly. God will bless the Christian slaves if they undergo suffering that they do not deserve (2:18–20\). Christ has left us an example of how to behave in the face of undeserved suffering (2:21–25\).

#### 2:18a

**Servants, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect,**

* ¶ Servants, obey your masters/bosses with great respect/fear of God.
* ¶ You who are house slaves should be submissive and respectful, fearing God.

**Servants:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Servants* refers specifically to those slaves who worked within a household. Some versions such as the NIV translate this word as:

> Slaves (NIV)

**submit yourselves:** Peter wanted his believing slaves to choose to respect their masters, as all believers were to respect their rulers. See how you translated this same command in 2:13a.

**to your masters:** The word *masters* refers to the owners, the people who had authority over the slaves. They could be either male or female. Here is another way to translate this word:

> owners (GW)

**with all respect:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *all respect* means “greatly respect” or “respect very much.”

**respect:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *respect* is literally “fear.” Peter does not say whom his readers should respect or fear. Scholars suggest two possibilities:

1. They should respect their masters. For example:

    > always show respect to them (CEV) *(BSB, REB, CEV, NJB, GW; probably NASB, NIV, NCV, RSVThe NRSV uses “deference,” which certainly implies that the masters are the object. which use respect)*

2. They should fear God. This is the opinion of many commentatorsMichaels, page 138; Best, page 117; Achtemeier, page 195 who translates it as “all godly reverence”; Bigg, page 142; Lenski, page 115; Kelly, page 116\. and is probably being followed by the NET, which says:

    > with all reverence (NET) *(NET)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\) and the majority of English versions.

#### 2:18b–c

**not only…but even:** The Greek phrases that the BSB translates as *not only…but even* introduce two objects, the first one expected but the second unexpected. Consider what would be the natural way of introducing two such objects in your language.

#### 2:18b

**not only to those who are good and gentle,**

* Respect not only those masters who are kind and reasonable,
* Some will be kind and gentle,

**those who are good and gentle:** The phrase *those who are good and gentle* describes some masters. They are kind and considerate in the way they treat their slaves.

**gentle:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *gentle* means “mild, considerate.” Some other ways to translate this are:

> thoughtful (CEV)

> reasonable (NLT)

#### 2:18c

**but even to those who are unreasonable.**

* but also those who are cruel.
* and some will be harsh. Submit to all of them.

**those who are unreasonable:** The phrase *those who are unreasonable* refers to some others among the masters. These masters were treating their slaves in a harsh or hard way.

**unreasonable:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *unreasonable* literally means “bent, crooked.” In this context it is the opposite of good and considerate and means “unjust, hard to please.” These masters probably often punished their slaves by beating them. Some other ways to translate this are:

> cruel (NLT)

> unjust (REB)

God will bless the Christian slaves if they undergo suffering that they do not deserve (2:18–20\). Christ has left us an example of how to behave in the face of undeserved suffering (2:21–25\).

#### 2:19a

**For if anyone endures the pain of unjust suffering**

* For if a person patiently endures suffering that he does not deserve
* That is because, when someone accepts with patience troubles that are unfair

**For:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *For* introduces a reason why Peter was instructing his readers to submit to their masters, whether they were kind or harsh. Some English versions do not translate this conjunction, so that the introduction is implicit. Translate this conjunction in a way that is natural in your language.

**if anyone endures the pain of unjust suffering:** In some languages it may be necessary to separate the different actions involved in this verse part:

> if a person suffers without having done wrong and bears this bravely

> if a person does no wrong and yet is made to suffer and bears this bravely

**anyone:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *anyone* refers to any person, male or female.

**endures:** The Greek verb that the BSB translates as *endures* means “to be patient while suffering physically or mentally. Some other ways to translate this phrase include:

> bears up under (NIV)

> tolerate

**the pain of unjust suffering:** The phrase *the pain of unjust suffering* refers to unfair physical punishment. The slave had not done anything wrong, but his master punished him anyway. The punishment was unjust and the suffering undeserved. Some other ways to translate this phrase are:

> unfair treatment (NLT)

> the pain of undeserved suffering (GNT)

#### 2:19b

**because he is conscious of God,**

* because he is aware of God’s presence,
* because he is thinking about God,

**because he is conscious of God:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *because he is conscious of God* means “because he is thinking about God.” It implies that the slave knows what God wants him to do. Other ways to translate this include:

> mindful of God (RSV)

> being aware of God (NRSV)

> because God is in his thoughts (REB)

#### 2:19c

**this is to be commended.**

* it is praiseworthy.
* it is a good thing in the eyes of God.

**this is to be commended:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *this is to be commended* is literally “this is grace.” In this context, “grace” refers to an action that is good and worthy of praise. It is an action that God approves or favors. In some languages it may be necessary to make this information explicit. For example:

> this finds God’s favor (NET)

> God is pleased (GW)

> God will bless you (CEV)

#### 2:20a–b

**How is it to your credit if you are beaten for doing wrong and you endure it?:** This is a rhetorical question. It implies a negative answer, “It is not to your credit at all.” It is really a strong negative statement. There are two ways to translate it:

* Translate it as a rhetorical question. For example:

    > What credit do you deserve if you endure a beating for doing something wrong? (GW)

* Translate it as a statement. For example:

    > If you are beaten for doing wrong, there is no reason to praise you for being patient in your punishment. (NCV)

#### 2:20a

**How is it to your credit**

* But in what way is it praiseworthy
* But there is no special merit

This sentence begins with a Greek conjunction that the BSB does not translate but which the NIV translates as “But” and the RSV as “For.” It introduces a reason why the punishment one endures has to be “unjust” for this to be commendable. You should introduce this in a way that is natural in your language.

**How is it to your credit…?:** The phrase *how is it to your credit* means “what honor do you deserve from God…?” Other translation models include:

> who will praise you…?

> what glory is there…?

#### 2:20b

**if you are beaten for doing wrong and you endure it?**

* if you do wrong and then endure the punishment that your master gives you?
* in enduring a beating that you well deserve.

**if you are beaten for doing wrong and you endure it:** In some languages it may be natural to translate the events in this verse part in the order in which they happen. For example:

> if you do wrong and then receive your punishment patiently

**are beaten:** The phrase *you are beaten* is a passive verbal phrase. It refers to being punished severely by being hit repeatedly. In some cases the master would beat the servant personally, but in others he would perhaps order another servant to do it. So you could translate this as:

> your master punishes you

> your master causes/orders you to be beaten

#### 2:20c

**But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it,**

* But if you do good and he beats you, and you patiently endure it,
* However if you are patient when your master causes you to suffer for doing good,

**But:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *But* here introduces an alternative possibility. Translate this conjunction in a way that is natural in your language. An English idiom to express this idea is:

> On the other hand (REB)

**if you suffer for doing good and you endure it:** In some languages it may be necessary to make explicit that the slave suffers “punishment,” or a beating, as in the previous verse part:

> if you do nothing but what is right, and your master still punishes you and you endure that punishment patiently

#### 2:20d

**this is commendable before God.**

* this is praiseworthy in the eyes of God.
* God considers this good behavior.

**this is commendable before God:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *this is commendable before God* is literally “this is grace/favor before God.” It means that this kind of suffering pleases God. See how you translated *to be commended* in 2:19a. Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> this finds favor with God (NET)

#### 2:21a

**For to this you were called,**

* For God called you to suffer in this way,
* Because this is what God knew you would endure when he chose you,

**For:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *For* introduces a reason why God was pleased when his people suffered patiently. Some English versions do not translate this conjunction. Introduce this verse in a way that is natural in your language.

**to this you were called:** The phrase *to this* refers back to 2:20\. It refers to suffering injustice with patience. Christians are to endure suffering patiently even though they may have done no wrong.

**you were called:** This is passive. It was God who *called* Peter’s readers to endure suffering patiently. In some languages it may be natural to use an active verb and make the subject explicit:

> God called you

Some other ways to translate this verse part include:

> This is what you were called to do (NCV)

> God called you to endure suffering (GW)

#### 2:21b

**because Christ also suffered for you,**

* because even Christ suffered for your sake.
* for Christ himself endured pain for you.

**Christ also suffered for you:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *also* could be emphasizing that it was Christ who suffered. The word could be translated “even” or “indeed.” Here is another way to translate this clause:

> Christ himself suffered on your behalf (REB)

#### 2:21c

**leaving you an example,**

* He acted as a model for you
* He gave/showed you an example/pattern to follow

**leaving you an example:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *leaving you an example* means that Christ acted as a model or pattern for us. He showed us how we should behave. Some other ways to translate this phrase include:

> He is your example (NLT)

> who set an example…for you (CEV)

#### 2:21d

**that you should follow in His footsteps:**

* so that you should behave as he did.
* in order that you should do/act as he did.

**that:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *that* here introduces a purpose clause. It can also be translated as:

> so that

> in order that

**you should follow in His footsteps:** The phrase *follow in his footsteps* is a figure of speech. It literally speaks of a person walking behind another, stepping in their footsteps. Figuratively it refers to patterning one’s life after someone else. Peter wanted his readers to act in the way Jesus Christ acted. If translating *footsteps* literally would make the meaning unclear in your language, you could consider translating the meaning directly. For example:

> So you should do as he did. (NCV)

#### 2:22–25

These verses are based on chapter 53 of Isaiah, which describes the suffering and death of the Messiah. Some versions put verse 22\. the last sentence of verse 24, and the first clause in verse 25 in quotation marks, since they are taken more directly from Isaiah. But since Peter does not use exact quotations, it is not necessary to use quotation marks. In these verses, Peter applied this description of the Messiah to Christ.

#### 2:22a

**“He committed no sin,**

* He did no bad thing at all,
* Jesus Christ never sinned

**He committed no sin:** The phrase *He committed no sin* means that the Messiah did nothing wrong or evil at all. Peter applied this reference to Christ. During his whole life, Jesus never broke God’s law or did anything that displeased God. This is a reference to Isaiah 53:9\. Some other ways this phrase has been translated include:

> He never sinned (NLT)

> Christ did not sin (CEV)

#### 2:22b

**and no deceit was found in His mouth.”**

* and he told no lies.
* and never lied to anyone.

**no deceit was found in His mouth:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *no deceit was found in His mouth* is an idiom that means “he never deceived anyone” or “he never told a lie.” It continues the reference to Isaiah 53:9 describing the Messiah, which Peter applied to Christ. Some other ways this phrase has been translated are:

> he was guilty of no falsehood (REB)

> and he had never lied (NCV)

**When they heaped abuse on Him, He did not retaliate;**

* When they insulted him, he did not insult them in return.
* People said evil things to Jesus Christ, but he did not reply with evil words.

**When they heaped abuse on Him:** With the phrase *they heaped abuse on Him*, the BSB is using a figure of speech to indicate that people insulted Jesus. The Jewish leaders and Roman soldiers said that Jesus was evil and had said and done evil things. This is literally a passive verbal phrase in Greek, “who, being reviled.” Some other ways to translate this phrase include:

> When he was insulted (GNT)

> When people spoke against him

**He did not retaliate:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *retaliate* means to strike back against someone either physically or verbally. In this context, it refers to answering in an evil way to someone who has spoken evil about you. An English idiom for this expression is “get even.” Other translation models include:

> he did not answer back (NET)

> he did not insult them in return (NCV)

#### 2:23b

**when He suffered, He made no threats,**

* When they made him suffer, he did not threaten to make them suffer.
* When they abused him, he did not say that he would do evil to them.

**when He suffered:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *when He suffered* is applied by Peter to the time when Jesus suffered and died on the cross. In some languages it may be necessary to indicate who was responsible for Jesus suffering. For example:

> when people caused him to suffer

**He made no threats:** The phrase *He made no threats* means that the Messiah did not say that he would harm to the people who were insulting him. Other ways to translate this include:

> he threatened no retaliation (NET)

> he uttered no threats (REB)

#### 2:23c

**but entrusted Himself to Him who judges justly.**

* But he put his matter/cause into the hands of the one just judge.
* Rather/No, he surrendered himself to the God who judges everyone justly.

**but:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *but* introduces what Christ did instead of reviling and threatening his enemies. The NIV translates this conjunction as:

> Instead (NIV)

**entrusted Himself to:** The Greek verb that the BSB translates as *he entrusted* means to commit or hand over someone or something to someone else. The Greek text does not have a direct object. The BSB has supplied the word *Himself*. It is also possible to supply words meaning “his affair” or “what concerned him.” Some other ways to translate this phrase are:

> left everything to (GW)

> placed his hopes in (GNT)

> left his case in (NLT)

**Him who judges justly:** The one who judges justly is God. In some languages it may be necessary to make this explicit. For example:

> God who judges justly

> God, who always judges fairly (NLT)

## 1 Peter 2:24 (id: 474535)

### Section 2:13–25: God’s people should respect the rulers/chiefs of this world

In this section Peter explained in what way his readers should live good lives among their pagan neighbors. They should respect and obey their rulers, including those who ruled locally in the village or town and those who ruled the country. They should also respect and obey the chief ruler of all, the emperor of Rome. God had given these people authority to punish people who do evil and praise those who do good.

Some other headings for this section are:

> Respect the Authority of Others (GW)

> Submission to Rulers and Masters (NIV)

### Paragraph 2:18–25

Peter now deals with how Christian slaves should behave. The slaves must respect and obey their masters, even if their masters treat them harshly. God will bless the Christian slaves if they undergo suffering that they do not deserve (2:18–20\). Christ has left us an example of how to behave in the face of undeserved suffering (2:21–25\).

#### 2:24a

**He Himself bore our sins in His body on the tree,**

* He/Christ received the penalty of our evil actions in his body when he died on that wooden cross,
* Jesus Christ took the load of our sins on his head/back at the time he died on the cross,

**He Himself bore our sins:** The phrase *He himself* refers to Jesus Christ.

**bore our sins:** The phrase *bore our sins* pictures our sins as a heavy weight that Christ voluntarily took upon himself. The illustration indicates that Christ took the blame/punishment for the evil things that we have done. Another way to translate *bore* is:

> carried (GNT)

**in His body:** This phrase indicates that it was as a human being that Christ bore our sins. If it is more natural, you could say:

> on his head/back

> in his human flesh

**on the tree:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *tree* is literally “wood” and refers to the cross. Some English versions translate tree as:

> cross (NIV, GW)

#### 2:24b–c

**so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness:** In the Greek text this is literally “so that dying to sins, we might live for righteousness.” For reasons of English style, the BSB has translated this as two separate purpose clauses. Translate it in whichever way is natural, but the idea of living for righteousness should be the main idea.

#### 2:24b

**so that we might die to sin**

* so that dying to all that is sinful/evil
* so that we(incl) might be like dead people concerning/towards bad deeds,

**die to sin:** The phrase *die to sin* is a metaphor. It means that as far as sin is concerned, we should be like dead people, that is, not respond to the temptation to sin in any way. Some other ways to translate this phrase are:

> so that we would stop sinning (CEV)

> so we would stop living for sin (NCV)

#### 2:24c

**and live to righteousness.**

* we might live for the sake of what is good.
* and that we(incl) might live to do what is right.

**and live to righteousness:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *live to righteousness* means “live in order to do what is right.” Here are some other ways to translate this:

> and live for what is right (NLT)

> we could live a life that has God’s approval (GW)

#### 2:24d

**“By His stripes you are healed.”**

* It is the wounds of Christ that have healed you.
* It is because people wounded/injured Jesus Christ that you have become well/whole.

**“By His stripes you are healed”:** This is a more direct reference to Isaiah 53:5, and many versions, including the BSB, put it int quotation marks. The verb *are healed* is in the passive. If you need to use an active verb, you could say:

> his wounds have healed you

> because people wounded Christ, you have become well/whole

**stripes:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *stripes* is literally “bruise.” It refers to the marks made on someone’s body by a beating or whipping. Here is another way to translate this:

> cuts and bruises (CEV)

**you are healed:** The phrase *you are healed* means that Peter’s readers had been made well from the harm or damage that sin had done to them. They had been made whole in a spiritual sense. Another way to translate this phrase is:

> made well

* **Associated Passages:** 1PE 2:24

They should respect and obey their rulers, including those who ruled locally in the village or town and those who ruled the country. They should also respect and obey the chief ruler of all, the emperor of Rome. God had given these people authority to punish people who do evil and praise those who do good.

God will bless the Christian slaves if they undergo suffering that they do not deserve (2:18–20\). Christ has left us an example of how to behave in the face of undeserved suffering (2:21–25\).

#### 2:25a

**For “you were like sheep going astray,”**

* For you used to be straying like lost sheep,
* Because you were formerly like sheep who had lost the path.

**For:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *For* introduces a quotation from Isaiah that relates to what Peter has just said. Some English versions do not translate this conjunction. Introduce this Old Testament quotation in a way that is natural for your language. Some versions (BSB, NIV) put the allusion to Isaiah in quotation marks, even though it is not a direct quotation.

**you were like sheep going astray:** This is a metaphor. In this Old Testament quotation, people who do not know God are compared to *sheep*. Those are domestic animals that are raised for meat and for wool. In some languages there may not be a word for *sheep*. If that is true in your language, you may borrow the word for sheep and indicate its meaning with a general word. For example:

> an animal called sheep

**going astray:** The phrase *going astray* means to go in the wrong direction or off the correct path/way. Some other ways to translate this phrase are:

> wandered away (NLT)

> lost (GW)

> gone on the wrong path

#### 2:25b

**but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.**

* but now you have turned towards Christ, your Shepherd and Guardian.
* But at this time, you have come/gone to join/meet the Person who is caring for you and protecting you.

**now:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *now* referred to the situation at the time when Peter was writing.

**you have returned:** The Greek verb that the BSB translates as *you have returned* here means “have turned to.” Peter’s readers had not been Christians at any previous time in the past. They had not gone back to Jesus after having left him. So the REB says:

> you have turned towards

**the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls:** Peter was referring to Jesus Christ. He was the Shepherd of all who believed on him, and he was their Overseer also.

**Shepherd:** A *Shepherd* is someone who takes care of animals such as sheep and goats. This is a metaphor. Jesus is like a shepherd in the sense that he leads and cares for those who belong to him. Since this is a very important metaphor in both the New and Old Testaments, it is recommended that you translate it literally. See Psalm 23:1 and John 10:11 as additional examples.

**Overseer:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Overseer* means one who watches over and protects others. Other ways to translate it include:

> guardian (REB)

> Protector (NCV)

> Keeper (GNT)

**your souls:** Here the term *souls* refers to the entire person (as in 1:9\), since there is no contrast with “body.” *Your souls* could be translated as:

> you

## 1 Peter 3:1 (id: 474537)

### Section 3:1–7: Husbands and wives should honor one another

In this section, Peter gave instructions about family life. The wife should accept her husband’s authority, even if he is not a Christian, and try to influence him to faith in Christ by her good behavior. Husbands also should show honor towards their wives. Peter also said that when both husband and wife are believers, they share equally in the blessings of their new life in Christ.

Some other headings for this section are:

> Wives and Husbands (NIV)

> Instructions for wives and husbands

#### 3:1a

**Wives, in the same way, submit yourselves to your husbands,**

* ¶ Similarly, you wives, you should submit/defer to your husbands,
* ¶ Also, married women should accept their husbands’ authority

**Wives, in the same way, submit yourselves to your husbands:** Peter wanted each married woman to accept the authority of her husband. He expected that each wife would have one husband and that each husband would have one wife. In some languages it may be necessary to make this clear by using the singular forms. For example:

> Let each wife submit to her husband

> Every married woman should be submissive to her husband

**in the same way:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *in the same way* here introduces a new subject on the same general theme. Peter gave another example of how Christians should behave respectfully towards those who are in authority over them. Some other ways to translate this are:

> in a similar way (NLT)

> Likewise (RSV)

**submit yourselves to your husbands:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *submit yourselves* is the same as in 2:18a. Peter wanted women who were believers to choose to respect their husbands, even if their husbands were not believers. Some other ways to translate this phrase include:

> accept the authority of your husbands (NLT)

> place yourselves under your husbands’ authority (GW)

#### 3:1b

**so that even if they refuse to believe the word,**

* so that those who reject the word of God
* in order that those men/husbands who do not believe God’s message

**so that:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *so that* introduces a purpose or goal. This purpose is stated in 3:1c. Here is another way to translate this:

> then (NET)

**even if they refuse to believe the word:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *even if they refuse to believe the word* assumes that some husbands refused to believe the word. Peter had no doubt that there were many such men. In some languages it may be necessary to make this clear. For example, it may be possible to say:

> as many as do not obey the word

> those who do not believe the word

**refuse to believe the word:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *refuse to believe the word* is literally “disobey the word.” Here it means “disobey the message from God by not believing in Jesus.” Peter was referring to men who were not Christians. The verb *refuse to believe* is the same as in 2:8c (note on “disobey the word”).

**the word:** The phrase *the word* refers to the word of God and means “the word that comes from God.” If people in your area would not understand that, you may want to include the implied words.

Some other ways *the word* has been translated include:

> God’s word (GW)

> God’s teaching (NCV)

> the Good News (NLT)

#### 3:1c

**they will be won over without words by the behavior of their wives**

* will be won over to the faith by your(fem/plur) behavior, without any words being spoken.
* may be persuaded to believe in Christ by the excellent way their wives behave. Their wives will not need to preach to them(masc),

**they will be won over…by the behavior of their wives:** The Greek expression that the BSB translates as *they will be won over…by the behavior of their wives* is in the passive. In some languages it may be necessary to use an active verb:

> the behavior of their wives might win them over

> the way their wives behave will win them

**won over:** The Greek verb that the BSB translates as *won over* here is a figure of speech. It means “gained for the Lord,” that is, convinced or persuaded to become a Christian. Some other ways to translate this expression are:

* Keep the figure. For example:

    > win these men for Christ (GW)

    > win them over to believe (GNT)

* Translate the meaning. For example:

    > persuaded to believe (NCV)

    > convinced to believe in Christ

**of their wives:** If you translated 3:1a as a direct command to wives, it may be natural to translate *of their wives* as:

> of you, their wives

> your(fem/plur)

**without words:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *without words* here means “without the wife talking to her husband about Jesus.” It does not mean that the wife refuses to talk to her husband, or that she never even tells him that she is a Christian. It means that the way she acts should be so attractive to her husband that she will not need to keep on speaking to him about Jesus. Some other ways to translate this phrase include:

> without saying anything (GW)

> It will not be necessary for you to say a word (GNT)

### Section 3:1–7: Husbands and wives should honor one another

In this section, Peter gave instructions about family life. The wife should accept her husband’s authority, even if he is not a Christian, and try to influence him to faith in Christ by her good behavior. Husbands also should show honor towards their wives. Peter also said that when both husband and wife are believers, they share equally in the blessings of their new life in Christ.

Some other headings for this section are:

> Wives and Husbands (NIV)

#### 3:2

**when they see your pure and reverent demeanor.**

* For they(masc) will observe that your(fem/plur) behavior/conduct is pure and reverent.
* because they will be watching them(fem) behave in a chaste and pious way.

This verse is the reason of the result of 3:1a–c. You should introduce and connect it to 3:1 in a way that is natural in your language. In some languages it may be more natural to begin a new sentence here. For example:

> Your husbands will see… (NCV)

**when they see:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *when they see* is literally “seeing.” In this context it is equivalent to “because they see” (as in the GNT). The Greek verb is the same as in 2:12c and means to observe closely.

**your pure and reverent demeanor:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *your pure and reverent demeanor* is more literally “your pure way of life in fear.” The phrase “in fear” refers to fearing God. In some languages it may be natural to translate the phrase “in fear” as an adjective, as the BSB has done. Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> in what a pure and reverent way you live

> how pure and reverent are your lives

> how pure and reverent your conduct is (GNT)

**pure:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *pure* refers to holy and chaste behavior. Another way to translate *pure* is:

> sincere

**reverent:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *reverent* is literally “fear.” It is the same as in 2:18a (note on “respect”). There are two ways of understanding this word in this context:

1. It refers to reverence for God. For example:

    > your respect for God (NCV) *(BSB, NIV, RSV, NJB, CEV, NET, NLT, GNT, NCV)*

2. It refers to respect for the husband. For example:

    > respectful behavior (NASB) *(NASB, REB)*

The KJV does not indicate whom the women were to fear. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). This interpretation is implied by the use of the word *reverence* in the majority of English versions.

##### **General Comment on 3:1c–3:2**

In some languages it may be natural to reorder the clauses of 3:1c and 3:2 in this way:

> 1cEven though you do not speak about Christ to them, 2they will see that you behave in a way that is holy and pious/reverential. 1cThen they will turn and believe in him.

Some other headings for this section are:

#### 3:3a

**Your beauty should not come from outward adornment,**

* Do not try to become beautiful by decorating/adorning your bodies
* Do not decorate your body in order to make yourself beautiful.

**Your beauty should not come from outward adornment:** The Greek expression that the BSB translates as *Your beauty should not come from outward adornment* is a command to wives. Peter did not want them to spend an excessive amount of money in order to try to make themselves beautiful by decorating their bodies. Different ways to say this include:

> Let your beauty not be external (NET)

> Do not adorn yourselves outwardly (NRSV)

**outward adornment:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *outward adornment* refers to all of the ways people try to make their bodies beautiful. It includes everything that is physical, not just the outer layer of clothes. Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> outward aids (GNT)

#### 3:3b

**such as braided hair or gold jewelry or fine clothes,**

* with things like braiding your hair, and putting on gold ornaments, and dressing in expensive clothes.
* There is no need to arrange your hair in a fancy way, wear gold ornaments, or dress immodestly.

**such as braided hair or gold jewelry or fine clothes:** This verse part gives three examples of ways in which women in Peter’s time tried to make themselves beautiful.

**braided hair:** Peter was thinking of the elaborate way Greek and Roman ladies used to do their hair. If in your area women normally braid their hair, you will need to choose an expression that refers to elaborate or fancy braiding. Some other ways to translate *braided hair* include:

> fancy hairstyles (NLT)

> the way you fix your hair (GNT)

**gold jewelry:** The word *gold* refers to a very valuable metal that is strong and beautiful. See how you translated this word in 1:7\.

**fine clothes:** The BSB has supplied the word *fine*. Peter was forbidding women from trying to make themselves look beautiful by wearing expensive or immodest clothes. Other ways to translate *fine clothes* are:

> beautiful clothes (NLT)

> expensive clothes (CEV)

##### **General Comment on 3:3**

In some languages it may be natural to combine 3:3a and 3:3b by following one of these models:

> It is not fancy hair, gold jewelry or fine clothes that should make you beautiful. (NCV)

> Don’t depend on things like fancy hairdos or gold jewelry or expensive clothes to make you look beautiful. (CEV)

#### 3:4

A woman who is gentle and humble is the one who is truly beautiful, and this beauty will not disappear as she gets older.

#### 3:4a

**but from the inner disposition of your heart,**

* Instead, your(fem/plur) beauty should come from within you.
* Instead, let your(fem/plur) character make you beautiful.

**but:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *but* introduces the second half of a contrast. In this verse Peter says where true beauty comes from. Introduce this contrast in a way that is natural for your language. Here is another way to translate this transition:

> Rather (GW)

**from the inner disposition of your heart:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *from the inner disposition of your heart* continues the thought from the previous verse. Some translations make this explicit:

> No, your beauty should come from within you (NCV)

**the inner disposition of your heart:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *the inner disposition of your heart* is literally “the hidden person of the heart.” It refers to a woman’s character—what she is like on the inside. This true nature is revealed in a person’s attitudes and behavior.

#### 3:4b

**the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit,**

* A gentle and quiet spirit will give you a beauty that does not fade/diminish
* Kindness and tranquillity will make you beautiful all your life,

**the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit:** The phrase *the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit* means “that unfading beauty which consists in a gentle and quiet spirit.” Peter was saying that to possess a virtuous character is to possess true beauty.

**unfading beauty:** The phrase *unfading beauty* means “a beauty that will not diminish.” As a woman gets older, the beauty of her body may lessen, but the beauty of her spirit and character will not lessen. See the notes on 1:4b, where the Greek word for *unfading* is translated as “can never…fade.” Some other ways to translate *unfading beauty* are:

> This kind of beauty will last… (CEV)

> beauty…that can’t be destroyed (GW)

In some languages it may not be possible to use an abstract noun such as “beauty.” Another possibility is to say:

> a gentle and quiet spirit that will always remain beautiful

**gentle:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *gentle* means humble, not demanding one’s way, not pushy or selfishly assertive. Some other ways to translate this word include:

> kind

> humble

**quiet:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *quiet* means calm, peaceful, patient. This word is also used in 1 Timothy 2:2\. Here is another way to translate this word:

> tranquil (NET)

**spirit:** This Greek word that the BSB translates as *spirit* here refers to the character, nature, or disposition of a person. Peter was talking about a woman’s thoughts and attitude. Here is another way to translate this word:

> attitude (GW)

#### 3:4c

**which is precious in God’s sight.**

* and is very valuable/precious to God.
* and God highly values people who have those qualities.

**which is precious in God’s sight:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *which is precious in God’s sight* means “which God values highly.” God values a woman who is gentle and quiet in her spirit. It is implied that he does not value external beauty in the same way. Another way to translate this is:

> which…is very precious to God (NCV)

Peter now gave an example of a woman in the Old Testament who had this inner beauty, Sarah, Abraham’s wife.

#### 3:5a

**For this is how**

* For in this way
* Because by doing this

**For:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *For* here introduces an example of women who acted as Peter had just recommended. Some English versions do not translate this conjunction. Translate it in a way that is natural to introduce an example in your language. Here is another way to translate this:

> For example (CEV)

**this is how:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *this is how* here refers back to the previous verse and implies “having a gentle and quiet spirit and not wearing excessive clothes and jewelry.” Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> In this same way (NCV)

#### 3:5b

**the holy women of the past adorned themselves.**

* the holy women of ancient times made themselves beautiful.
* the godly women of long ago made their lives attractive,

**the holy women of the past:** Peter was referring to the women whose good lives were recorded in the Old Testament.

**holy women:** The phrase *holy women* means women who belonged to God and who lived pure and pious lives because they belonged to God. Some other ways to translate this phrase include:

> devout women (GNT)

> women of God’s people (REB)

**adorned themselves:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *adorned themselves* is a verb is in the imperfect, implying that this is what the holy women regularly or customarily did. Some other ways to translate this phrase are:

> used to make themselves beautiful (NIV)

> expressed their beauty (GW)

> their beauty was like this…

#### 3:5c

**They put their hope in God**

* They put their trust in God.
* the ones who trusted God.

**They put their hope in God:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *They put their hope in God* means “They trusted God.” See how you translated *hope* in 1:3c and 1:21c.

#### 3:5d

**and were submissive to their husbands,**

* They(fem) were respectful/obedient to their own husbands.
* They(fem) accepted the authority of their husbands.

**and were submissive to their husbands:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *were submissive* is the same as in 3:1a.

### Section 3:1–7: Husbands and wives should honor one another

In this section, Peter gave instructions about family life. The wife should accept her husband’s authority, even if he is not a Christian, and try to influence him to faith in Christ by her good behavior. Husbands also should show honor towards their wives. Peter also said that when both husband and wife are believers, they share equally in the blessings of their new life in Christ.

Some other headings for this section are:

> Wives and Husbands (NIV)

> Instructions for wives and husbands

#### 3:6a

**just as Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him lord.**

* Sarah is one of these women. She obeyed Abraham and called him her master.
* Abraham’s wife Sarah is an example of a woman who obeyed her husband and spoke of him with respect.
* Sarah the wife of Abraham behaved like this. She obeyed Abraham and honoured him by the way she spoke of him.

**just as Sarah obeyed Abraham:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *just as* introduces an example of one of the holy women who adorned herself by submitting to her own husband. Peter is using Sarah as an example, not as a comparison. If using a comparison with “like” or “as” might suggest in your language that Sarah was not one of these holy women, you could say:

> Sarah was an example of one of these

**Sarah obeyed Abraham:** In some languages it may be necessary to make it explicit that Sarah was Abraham’s wife or that Abraham was Sarah’s husband. For example:

> Sarah, who obeyed her husband Abraham

> Sarah, the wife of Abraham, who obeyed him

**called him lord:** This is an allusion to Genesis 18:12\. In the Genesis passage, Sarah was speaking about rather than directly to her husband.

The Greek word that the BSB translates as *lord* was a common title of respect for any person in authority. It did not imply that the speaker was a servant or slave. In your translation, you could:

* Use a word that women in your culture use to speak politely of and to their husbands.
* Use a general expression such as:

    > gave honor to her husband when she spoke to/of him

#### 3:6b

**And you are her children**

* You show yourselves to be like Sarah
* You are like her obedient daughters

**And you are her children:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *you are her children* is literally “you became her children.” The term could refer to descendants, but most of Peter’s readers were probably not physical descendants of Abraham and Sarah (that is, Jews). Peter meant this in a figurative sense: “you became like Sarah in character.” Consider if your readers would understand a literal translation. If not, you may need to say something like:

> you have become like her

#### 3:6c

**if you do what is right and refuse to give way to fear.**

* if you do what is right and do not allow anything/anyone to frighten you.
* when you do good and do not let others make you afraid.

**refuse to give way to fear:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *refuse to give way to fear* is literally “not fearing any terror.” Peter was probably implying that the women should not be afraid of their non\-Christian husbands. But he did not limit it to this, and so it is better to supply a general object:

> do not be terrified of anyone/anything

##### **General Comment on 3:6b–c**

In some languages it may be natural to reverse the order of 3:6b and c. For example:

> 6cBy doing good and showing no fear, 6byou have become her daughters. (REB)

Peter also said that when both husband and wife are believers, they share equally in the blessings of their new life in Christ.

Some other headings for this section are:

> Wives and Husbands (NIV)

> Instructions for wives and husbands

#### 3:7

**Husbands…treat your wives…as a delicate vessel:** There are two ways of understanding the structure of this verse:

1. The phrase “as a delicate vessel” belongs with the command to treat one’s wife with respect/honor. For example:

    > Likewise you husbands, live considerately with your wives, bestowing honor on the woman as the weaker sex, since you are joint heirs of the grace of life…. (RSV) *(RSV, NIV, KJV, REB, CEV, NJB)*

2. The phrase “as a delicate vessel” belongs with the command to be considerate to one’s wife. For example:

    > Husbands, in the same way treat your wives with consideration as the weaker partners and show them honor as fellow heirs of the grace of life…. (NET) *(BSB, NASB, GNT, NET, GW, NCV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).

#### 3:7a

**Husbands, in the same way, treat your wives with consideration**

* ¶ Husbands, likewise, live with your wives in a wise/thoughtful/good way.
* ¶ You men who are married should also behave wisely/thoughtfully towards your wife.

**Husbands:** The term you use to translate *Husbands* should match the term you used in 3:1a. Peter is now starting to address a different group of people, Christian men who are married.

**in the same way:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *in the same way* is the same word as in 3:1a. It introduces a new subject on the same general theme of treating one another appropriately and with respect. THere is another way to translate this phrase:

> Likewise (RSV)

**treat your wives with consideration:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *treat your wives with consideration* is literally “live with \[your wives] according to knowledge/understanding.” Peter wanted Christian husbands to be wise in the way they treated their wives and to try to understand them. Other translation models include:

> you husbands must show understanding in your married life (REB)

> If you are a husband, you should be thoughtful of your wife (CEV)

**your wives:** Each husband was to have only one wife. In some languages it may therefore be natural to use the singular. For example:

> your wife

#### 3:7b

**as a delicate vessel, and with honor**

* You know that your wives are weaker than you, so honour them,
* Give your wife honour/respect, because she is not as strong as you are.

**as a delicate vessel:** There are two ways of understanding how the phrase *as a delicate vessel* connects to the command “treat them with respect”:

1. Husbands were to treat their wives with respect because women are weaker than men. For example:

    > since they are weaker than you (NCV) *(BSB, NIV, CEV, REB, KJV, NCV)*

2. Husbands were to treat their wives with respect in spite of the fact that women are weaker than men. For example:

    > though she may be the weaker partner (NJB) *(NJB)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\) and the majority of English versions.

**delicate vessel:** Peter did not say in what way he thought that women were more *delicate* than men. He was probably thinking of them as being physically weaker and restricted by the social customs of that time.

**vessel:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as “vessel” refers to in this context to being a human being. Some versions do not translate this word, leaving the meaning implied from the context. For example:

> since they are weaker than you (GW)

> she is not as strong a person as you are

**with honor:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *with honor* is literally “give due honor.” Refer to your translation of 2:17a, where a similar phrase is used. Here in 3:7b Peter used the noun meaning “honor” and a different verb, but the meaning is the same. Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> Treat her with honor (CEV)

#### 3:7c

**as fellow heirs of the gracious gift of life,**

* because you, with them, are receiving that life which God freely gives to his people.
* Together you will receive from God the kind/generous gift of eternal life.

**as fellow heirs of the gracious gift of life:** Peter was saying that both husband and wife will receive eternal life. God gives this gift to both men and women.

**heirs:** Peter is using *heirs* in a figurative sense to mean people who are given something by their father. God our Father gives eternal life to all his children, both men and women.

**the gracious gift of life:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *the gracious gift of life* refers to the eternal life that God gives by his grace/kindness.

Other ways to translate this include:

> she is your equal partner in God’s gift of new life (NLT)

> she will share with you the life that God kindly gives

> because they also will receive, together with you, God’s gift of life (GNT)

#### 3:7d

**so that your prayers will not be hindered.**

* Do this in order that nothing will stop you from praying to God.
* If you do not do this, your prayers will not be good in God’s eyes.

**so that your prayers will not be hindered:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *so that your prayers will not be hindered* is in the passive. It may be helpful in your language to put it in the active. Some versions begin a new sentence here. For example:

> In this way nothing will hinder your prayers. (NET)

> This will prevent anything from coming in the way of your prayers. (NJB)

Peter was saying that God will not answer men’s prayers if they do not treat their wives with kindness and respect. In some languages it may be clearer to express the meaning in a positive way:

> so that your prayers will be effective

> so that God may hear your prayers

## 1 Peter 3:8 (id: 474544)

### Section 3:8–22: God’s people may have to suffer for doing what is right

In this section Peter taught that Christians should always do good and act kindly towards others, even if they are mistreated and made to suffer. They should do this because it pleases God, and because that was how Jesus Christ behaved.

Some other headings for this section are:

> Suffering for Doing Right (CEV)

> Dedicate Your Lives to Jesus (GW)

#### 3:8a

**Finally, all of you, be like\-minded and sympathetic,**

* ¶ In conclusion, I say this to you: you all should have the same aims. Have pity for each other.
* ¶ To sum up: all of you, be united in your thinking. Care about one another,

**Finally:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Finally* here introduces a summary of what Peter had just been saying. It does not mean that this is the last sentence or paragraph of the letter. Some other ways to translate *Finally* are:

> To sum up

> Now I want to say this to you before I finish my letter (EASY)

**all of you:** Peter now began to address all his readers, male and female, slaves and masters. Here is another way to translate this:

> everyone (GW)

**be like\-minded:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *be like\-minded* is literally “being of one mind.” Peter wanted his readers to have the same aims and the same outlook. Other ways to translate this include:

> you should be in agreement (NCV)

> you must all have the same attitude and the same feelings (GNT)

**be…sympathetic:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *be…sympathetic* means having or showing kind feelings towards other people. It refers to being concerned about the joys and sorrows of other people. Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> have concern…for each other (CEV)

#### 3:8b

**love as brothers,**

* Love each other as brothers.
* and love one another like a family.

**love as brothers:** The noun form of the Greek word that the BSB translates as *love as brothers* is found in 1:22b.

#### 3:8c

**be tenderhearted and humble.**

* Show compassion and humility.
* Act kindly/compassionately and humbly.
* Be kind to each other, and do not be proud.

**be tenderhearted:** The Greek adjective that the BSB translates as *be tenderhearted* has a similar meaning to “sympathetic” in 3:8a. It means to care about other people and their sorrows and difficulties. Here is another way to translate this:

> being kind (NCV)

A common English idiom for this is:

> have a tender heart

**humble:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *humble* describes people who do not think of themselves as better or more important than others. They are not proud or arrogant. Another way to express being *humble* is:

> not proud

* **Associated Passages:** 1PE 3:8

## 1 Peter 3:9 (id: 474545)

### Section 3:8–22: God’s people may have to suffer for doing what is right

In this section Peter taught that Christians should always do good and act kindly towards others, even if they are mistreated and made to suffer. They should do this because it pleases God, and because that was how Jesus Christ behaved.

Some other headings for this section are:

> Suffering for Doing Right (CEV)

> Dedicate Your Lives to Jesus (GW)

#### 3:9

This is similar to Jesus’ teaching in Luke 6:27–28\. If a Christian is treated badly by someone, he must do good to that person. God expects his people to behave like that, and he will bless them if they do.

#### 3:9a

**Do not repay evil with evil**

* Do not do evil to someone who has done evil to you,
* If anyone does evil to you, do not do evil to him in return.

**Do not repay evil with evil:** The phrase *Do not repay evil with evil* means “Do not do evil to someone in return for the evil they have done to you.” In some languages it may be natural to translate it as a conditional statement:

> If someone does evil to you, do not do evil back to them

> When someone harms you, do not take revenge

#### 3:9b

**or insult with insult,**

* and do not insult someone who insults you.
* If anyone insults you, do not insult him in return.

**or:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *or* here introduces another thing that believers were not to do. In some languages it may be natural to translate it as:

> and

**insult with insult:** There is some implied information here. The words “Do not repay” from 9a are implied at the beginning of this verse part. The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as Do not repay *insult with insult* in this context means “Do not speak evil to someone in return for the evil they have spoken to you.” Some other ways this phrase has been translated are:

> Do not pay back…cursing with cursing (GNT)

> Do not repay…abuse with abuse (REB)

##### **General Comment on 3:9a–b**

In some languages it may be natural to combine verse parts 9a–b after the model of the CEV:

> Don’t be hateful and insult people just because they are hateful and insult you.

#### 3:9c

**but with blessing,**

* Rather, give him a blessing.
* But instead, ask God to do good to him.

**but:** The Greek conjunction *de* that the BSB translates as *but* introduces what believers were to do instead of returning evil for evil. Here is another way to translate this transition:

> Instead (CEV)

**with blessing:** In some languages it may be natural to supply a verb here, probably the same verb that you used in 3:9a and 3:9b. The NCV has:

> repay with a blessing

In other languages it may be natural to translate the noun *blessing* as a verb:

> bless them (GW)

> bless others (NET)

**blessing:** There are two ways of interpreting the word *blessing* here:

1. It means that Christians should ask God to bless their enemies. See Matthew 5:44\.
2. It means that Christians should do good to their enemies. For example, the CEV says:

    > treat everyone with kindness *(BSB, CEV, NASB, NET, NIV, NRSV)*

Most English versions are ambiguous. If you must choose between these two interpretations, it is recommended that you choose interpretation (1\), which has the support of most commentaries.

#### 3:9d

**because to this you were called**

* For this/that is what God has called you to do,
* For God has called you to do this,

**to this you were called:** There are two ways to interpret the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *to this you were called*:

1. It refers backward to 3:9c and means “God called you to bless others.” For example:

    > That is what you were called to do (NJB) *(BSB, RSV, KJV, NLT, NCV, NIV, NJB)*

2. It refers forward to 3:9e and means “God called you in order to bless you.” For example:

    > for a blessing is what God intends you to receive (REB) *(NASB, REB, GNT, CEV, NET, GW)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). This agrees with 2:21, where the context is similar.

The phrase *to this you were called* is passive. God is the one who is doing the calling. In some languages it may be more natural to express this in an active form. For example:

> to this God has called you

**called:** The word *called* in this context means “invited” or “summoned.” The CEV translates this phrase as:

> You are God’s chosen ones (CEV)

#### 3:9e

**so that you may inherit a blessing.**

* so that you yourselves may receive a blessing.
* in order that he may do good things for you.

**so that:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *so that* here introduces the reason/purpose why God called his people to bless others. See how you translated similar expressions in 2:21 (“that”) and 2:24b (“so that”).

**you may inherit a blessing:** The phrase *you may inherit a blessing* means “you will receive a blessing.” It is implied that it is God who will give the blessing. In some languages it may be necessary to make this explicit:

> God will give you a blessing

> God will bless you

* **Associated Passages:** 1PE 3:9

## 1 Peter 3:10 (id: 474546)

### Section 3:8–22: God’s people may have to suffer for doing what is right

In this section Peter taught that Christians should always do good and act kindly towards others, even if they are mistreated and made to suffer. They should do this because it pleases God, and because that was how Jesus Christ behaved.

Some other headings for this section are:

> Suffering for Doing Right (CEV)

> Dedicate Your Lives to Jesus (GW)

#### 3:10–12

In these verses Peter quoted from Psalm 34 to warn his readers not to do evil to anyone who persecuted them. Peter also wanted to assure his readers that God was concerned for them. As this is an exact quotation from Scripture, it will be good to make this clear, either explicitly in the text or in a footnote.

#### 3:10a

**For,**

* Because the Scriptures say:
* In the Book of God it says:

**For:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *For* introduces a quotation that supports what Peter had just written. It is not itself part of the quotation. Translate this conjunction in a way that is natural for your language.

#### 3:10b

**“Whoever would love life and see good days**

* “If a person wants to live in contentment and be happy,
* “People who want to really enjoy their lives

This verse part is a quotation of Psalm 34:12\.

**Whoever would love life and see good days:** The Greek expression that the BSB translates as *Whoever would love life and see good days* is a doublet.

A doublet is the occurrence of two words or phrases together that have the same basic meaning. They are often used for emphasis or poetic effects. The two parts of the expression together mean “Whoever wants to enjoy life” or “Whoever wants to be happy/contented.”

Consider if it is natural in your language to say the same thing in two ways like this. Most English translations do keep the doublet. Examples include:

> A person must do these things to enjoy life and have many happy days (NCV)

> If you want a happy life and good days (NLT)

#### 3:10c

**must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from deceitful speech.**

* he must not speak bad things, he must not make evil plots.
* must not say hurtful things or tell harmful lies.

This verse part is a quotation of Psalm 34:13\.

**must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from deceitful speech:** This verse part is also a doublet. As is common in Hebrew poetry, the second clause restates the first. Together the two clauses mean:

> must not say things that are evil

Again, most English translations keep the doublet. For example:

> He must not say evil things, and he must not tell lies (NCV)

**keep his tongue from evil:** In this context the word *evil* refers to things that are intended to harm others. Other ways to translate this phrase are:

> keep from speaking evil (GNT)

> stop saying cruel things (CEV)

**deceitful speech:** In this context the Greek word that the BSB translates as *deceitful* describes untruthful words that are spoken in order to hurt or take advantage of someone else. Here is another way to translate this:

> telling lies (NLT)

* **Associated Passages:** 1PE 3:10

## 1 Peter 3:11 (id: 474547)

### Section 3:8–22: God’s people may have to suffer for doing what is right

In this section Peter taught that Christians should always do good and act kindly towards others, even if they are mistreated and made to suffer. They should do this because it pleases God, and because that was how Jesus Christ behaved.

Some other headings for this section are:

> Suffering for Doing Right (CEV)

> Dedicate Your Lives to Jesus (GW)

#### 3:11a

**He must turn from evil and do good;**

* He must avoid bad things and do good.
* They must do what is right instead of what is evil.

This verse part is a quotation of Psalm 34:14a.

**He must turn from evil and do good:** The verb phrases in this verse part say the same thing in different ways.

**turn from evil:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *turn from evil* means to avoid evil, that is, to refrain from doing anything that is morally wrong.

Some other ways to translate this are:

> Instead of doing evil, he must do what is right

> Give up your evil ways and do right (CEV)

#### 3:11b

**he must seek peace and pursue it.**

* He must aim for peace and make peace his goal.
* They must try with all their hearts to make peace between other people.

This verse part is a quotation of Psalm 34:14b.

**he must seek peace and pursue it:** This clause is also a poetic doublet. The GNT combines the two verbs into one:

> you must strive for peace with all your heart (GNT)

**he must seek peace:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *he must seek peace* means “he must work to make peace.” It is also possible to translate this as:

> he must try to live peacefully

**peace:** Here, *peace* refers to peace with other people, that is, good relationships.

**pursue it:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *pursue it* here means to make a strong effort to live in peace. Some other ways this phrase can be translated include:

> work to maintain it (NLT)

> strive for it

* **Associated Passages:** 1PE 3:11

## 1 Peter 3:12 (id: 474548)

### Section 3:8–22: God’s people may have to suffer for doing what is right

#### 3:12a

**For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,**

* For the Lord is watching righteous people,
* For the Lord looks after those who obey him,

This verse part is a quotation of Psalm 34:15a.

**For:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *For* introduces a reason why people should do good and seek peace. Some English versions do not translate this conjunction. Translate it a way that is natural to introduce a reason in your language.

**the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous:** The Greek expression that the BSB translates literally as *the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous* means “the Lord is watching the righteous.” It implies that the Lord is watching righteous people in order to take care of them.

**the righteous:** The phrase *the righteous* here refers to people who do what Peter has just talked about: who do not speak evil, who do good to their enemies, and who try to make peace.

Some other ways to translate this expression include:

> The Lord sees the good people (NCV)

> The Lord watches over everyone who obeys him (CEV)

> The Lord watches those who do what is right

#### 3:12b

**and His ears are inclined to their prayer.**

* and he listens to their prayers.
* and he pays attention to what they say when they pray to him.

This verse part is a quotation of Psalm 34:15b.

**His ears are inclined to their prayer:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *His ears are inclined to their prayer* means that the Lord listens to the prayers of righteous people. He not only hears them as he hears everything that everyone says, but he cares about what they say. He is attentive to their needs. Here is another way to translate this clause:

> he listens to their prayers (CEV)

#### 3:12c

**But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”**

* But the Lord opposes people who do wrong.”
* However, the Lord is against evil doers.”

This verse part is a quotation of Psalm 34:16a. Peter did not quote Psalm 34:16b.

**the face of the Lord is against those who do evil:** This is the opposite of the first part of the verse. It means that the Lord does not listen to the prayers of the wicked. Instead, he opposes them. Some translation models are:

> the Lord is against those who do evil (NCV)

> he opposes everyone who does evil (CEV)

> the Lord confronts those who do evil (GW)

### Section 3:8–22: God’s people may have to suffer for doing what is right

In this section Peter taught that Christians should always do good and act kindly towards others, even if they are mistreated and made to suffer. They should do this because it pleases God, and because that was how Jesus Christ behaved.

Some other headings for this section are:

#### 3:13

**Who can harm you if you are zealous for what is good?**

* ¶ If you try with all your heart to do good, no one will hurt you, will they?
* ¶ No one will harm you for working hard at doing what is right.
* ¶ If you are enthusiastic about doing good works, surely no one will attack you.

**Who can harm you if you are zealous for what is good?:** This is a rhetorical question with the implied answer “No one.” It is really a strong negative statement. There are two ways to translate this:

* As a rhetorical question. For example:

    > Who is going to do you harm if you are devoted to what is good? (REB)

    > Can anyone really harm you for being eager to do good deeds? (CEV)

* As an emphatic statement. For example:

    > Surely no one will harm you if you are eager to do good!

    > No one is going to harm you for working hard to do what is right!

Use whichever form is most natural for a strong negative statement in your language.

**zealous for what is good:** The word *eager* describes someone who has a strong interest or desire in something. Some other ways this word can be translated include:

> devoted (NET)

> trying hard (NCV)

#### 3:14a

**But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed.**

* But if you do suffer for doing right, you are blessed by God.
* But even if it happens that you get trouble because you do what is right, God will show you his favour.
* However, consider yourselves happy if you do suffer for doing good.

**But even if:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *But even if* introduces the possibility that what Peter had just said might not always be true. Peter admitted that sometimes people do harm those who are eager to do good. It is not common, but the possibility does exist. Here is another way to translate this:

> Yet if (REB)

**you should suffer:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *you should suffer* means “(if) you do suffer.” For example:

> you have to suffer (CEV)

In some languages it may be necessary to speak of who causes the suffering. For example:

> someone causes you to suffer

**for what is right:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *for what is right* here means “for doing what is right” or “because you are doing what is right.” Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> for doing what God approves (GW)

**you are blessed:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *you are blessed* means that people who suffer for doing right are actually fortunate or to be envied, because God is pleased with them. This is the same word used in Matthew 5:3–11 and Luke 6:20–22\. Refer to your translation there. Some other ways to translate this phrase are:

> How happy is your lot

> Consider yourselves favored by God

> God will do good to you

This phrase is passive. In some languages it may be necessary to use an active form. For example:

> God will bless you (CEV)

#### 3:14b

**“Do not fear what they fear;**

* “Do not fear anyone;
* “Do not be afraid of your enemies.

This verse part is a quotation of Isaiah 8:12\.

**Do not fear what they fear:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *Do not fear what they fear* is literally “do not fear their fear.” There are two ways of understanding this phrase:

1. It means “do not fear them.” For example:

    > Have no fear of them (RSV) *(GNT, NASB, REB, NET, GW, RSV)*

2. It means *Do not fear what they fear*. For example:

    > Do not fear what they fear (NRSV) *(BSB, NIV, NCV, NRSV)*

The KJV is ambiguous, and the NLT and CEV do not translate the object “their fear.” It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\) and the majority of English versions.

#### 3:14c

**do not be shaken.”**

* do not be worried.”
* Do not be upset/troubled about them.”

**do not be shaken:** The meaning of this phrase is very similar to “Do not fear…” in 3:14b. Some other ways this phrase has been translated include:

> don’t…be afraid of their threats (NLT)

> don’t worry about what people might do (CEV)

Some other headings for this section are:

> Suffering for Doing Right (CEV)

> Dedicate Your Lives to Jesus (GW)

#### 3:15a

**But in your hearts sanctify Christ as Lord.**

* But in your inmost being sanctify/revere Christ as your Lord.
* But instead honour Christ as your holy Lord.

**But:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *But* introduces a contrast to the negative commands in 3:14b–c. This is what the believers were to do instead of being frightened and disturbed. Introduce this contrast in a way that is natural in your language.

**in your hearts:** Peter used the Greek word that the BSB translates as *hearts* as a figure of speech. It refers to a person’s inner being, his deepest affections and convictions. See the General Comment on 3:15a below for translation advice on translating the meaning of this figure of speech.

**sanctify Christ as Lord:** In this context, the Greek word that the BSB translates as “sanctify” means to recognize or acknowledge Christ to be holy. In this context Peter was saying that believers are to honor and revere Jesus Christ as their Lord.

Other ways to translate this include:

> revere Christ as Lord (NIV)

> hold Christ…in reverence as Lord (REB)

##### **General Comment on 3:15a**

Peter was not referring to doing something privately and secretly, as the translation “in your hearts” might suggest. To avoid suggesting this meaning, some English versions translate *hearts* with “life” or “lives.” For example:

> dedicate your lives to Christ as Lord (GW)

> Honor Christ and let him be the Lord of your life (CEV)

> you must worship Christ as Lord of your life (NLT)

#### 3:15b

**Always be prepared to give a defense to everyone**

* Always be ready to answer everyone
* Plan carefully how to answer at any time anyone

**Always be prepared to give a defense to everyone:** Peter wanted his readers to be ready and willing to speak about Christ at any time. Some other ways to translate this clause are:

> Be ready at all times to answer anyone who asks you (GNT)

> Always be ready to answer everyone who asks you (NCV)

#### 3:15c

**who asks you the reason for the hope that is in you.**

* who asks you the reason why you have hope/trust in Christ.
* who asks you to tell him why you hope/trust in Christ.

**the reason for the hope that is in you:** In some languages it may be natural to simplify this expression. For example:

> about your hope (CEV)

**the hope that is in you:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *hope* here refers to trusting in Christ for salvation. See how you translated this word in 1:3, 1:13, 1:21 and 3:5\. Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> your Christian hope (NLT)

In many languages it may be natural to translate *hope* as a verb:

> you are hoping/trusting in Christ

##### **General Comment on 3:15b–c**

In some languages it may be natural to reverse the order of 3:15b and 3:15c. For example:

> 15cWhen anyone asks you why you are trusting in Christ, 15bbe ready to tell him the reason.

This is a long and complicated sentence. In some languages it may be natural to translate it using shorter sentences. For example:

> Some people may ask you why you hope in Christ. Be ready to give them an answer.

#### 3:15d

**But respond with gentleness and respect,**

* But answer him pleasantly/mildly and respectfully.
* But answer him with a quiet heart and respectful of God.

**But:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *But* and the RSV as “yet” introduces a command. Peter told the believers not to explain their hope in an aggressive or discourteous manner. Translate this conjunction in a way that is natural for your language.

**respond with gentleness and respect:** The phrase *respond with gentleness and respect* means “answer gently and respectfully.” Other ways to translate this include:

> you must do this in a gentle and respectful way (NLT)

> give a kind and respectful answer (CEV)

**gentleness:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *gentleness* can also be translated as “meekness.” Here it refers to a quiet and humble manner of speaking. See “gentle” in 3:4b. Here is another way to translate this word:

> courtesy (REB)

**respect:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *respect* is literally “fear.” Commentators agree that in this context it refers to fearing God.See for example, Michaels, page 189; “It is virtually certain…that *phobos* in v 16 means fear of God.” See also Achtemeier, page 234; Bigg, page 158; Kelly, page 144; Marshall, page 116, who all agree on this point. There are at least two ways to translate this word:

* Use a word that implies that God is the object. For example:

    > reverence (NASB)

* Supply the object “God.” For example:

    > fear/awe of God

### Section 3:8–22: God’s people may have to suffer for doing what is right

In this section Peter taught that Christians should always do good and act kindly towards others, even if they are mistreated and made to suffer. They should do this because it pleases God, and because that was how Jesus Christ behaved.

Some other headings for this section are:

> Suffering for Doing Right (CEV)

> Dedicate Your Lives to Jesus (GW)

#### 3:16a

**keeping a clear conscience,**

* Keep your conscience clear/unstained,
* Do nothing that will cause your heart to condemn you.

Christians should behave well so that those who insult them might become ashamed of what they have said.

**keeping a clear conscience:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *keeping a clear conscience* is literally “having a good conscience.” A person’s conscience is said to be *clear* or good when they have not done anything to feel ashamed of. They have only done what is right. Translators should think what idiom or expression their language uses for *conscience*.

#### 3:16b–c

**those who slander you may be put to shame by your good behavior in Christ:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *your good behavior in Christ* has been interpreted in two ways:

1. It indicates what other people *slander*. These people *slander* their *good behavior in Christ*. For example:

    > you will make people ashamed for saying bad things about your good conduct as a follower of Christ (CEV) *(CEV, GW, KJV, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, NJB, REB, GNT, RSV, NLT)*

2. It indicates how other people are *put to shame*. They are *put to shame* by *your good behavior in Christ*. For example:

    > if people speak against you, they will be ashamed when they see what a good life you live because you belong to Christ (NLT) *(BSB, NLT)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), as most English versions do.

#### 3:16b

**so that those who slander you**

* so that those people who say bad things
* Then those people who falsely say you have done wrong

**so that:** The phrase *so that* introduces the purpose for keeping a clear conscience, or doing what is right.

**those who slander you:** This is referring to people who were making false accusations about the Christians. Other ways to translate this include:

> they speak evil of you (KJV)

> people speak against you (NLT)

#### 3:16c

**may be put to shame by your good behavior in Christ.**

* about your good behavior as Christians will be ashamed of their bad words.
* when you have only behaved as Christians should will be put to shame because of their lies.

**may be put to shame:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *may be put to shame* here means “will be humiliated.” Peter was saying that these people would be brought into public disgrace and embarrassment. Another way to translate this is:

> they will become ashamed (EASY)

**your good behavior in Christ:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *in Christ* here identifies Peter’s readers as Christians, members of Christ’s body, his church. Other ways to translate this include:

> your good conduct as followers of Christ (GNT)

> what a good life you live because you belong to Christ (NLT)

Some other headings for this section are:

#### 3:17a

**For it is better, if it is God’s will,**

* If it should be that God permits trouble to come to
* Perhaps God may allow you to suffer for doing what is right.

#### 3:17b

**to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.**

* you as a result of doing good, this is better than bringing trouble to yourself as a result of doing evil.
* That is better than suffering for doing wrong.

#### 3:17a–b

Peter was saying that it may sometimes be God’s will that Christians suffer as a result of doing good. However, Christians should never bring suffering upon themselves by doing evil.

**For it is better, if it is God’s will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil:** This is a comparison. Neither of the two things being compared is actually good in the sense of desirable, but one is better than the other. Peter is saying that it is better to suffer from doing good than for doing evil.

**if it is God’s will:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *if it is God’s will* suggests that this is a possibility, but it is not likely.

**for doing good…for doing evil:** The Greek phrases that the BSB translates as *for doing good…for doing evil* here mean “because you have done good…because you have done evil.”

Some other ways this verse has been translated include:

> Remember, it is better to suffer for doing good, if that is what God wants, than to suffer for doing wrong! (NLT)

> You are better off to obey God and suffer for doing right than to suffer for doing wrong (CEV)

> After all, if it is God’s will, it’s better to suffer for doing good than for doing wrong. (NET)

#### 3:18a

**For Christ also suffered for sins once for all,**

* ¶ Consider the example of Christ: he died because of sins once for all time.
* ¶ The reason is that Jesus Christ himself died once for all time because of your sins.

As in 2:21–24, Peter refers to Christ’s sufferings in order to encourage the Christians to bear their suffering patiently.

**For:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *For* introduces a reason why it may be God’s will for Christians to suffer for doing right. The reason is that Christ himself did this. In some languages it may be possible to translate this conjunction as:

> You see

**Christ also:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *also* compares how Christians should suffer to how Christ died. Christ died innocently, as a righteous man, and that is the way Christians should suffer. However, Christians cannot die for sins to bring people to God. Make sure that your translation does not imply this. To avoid this, you may want to:

* Use a phrase that does not imply that the two situations are exactly the same. For example:

    > Christ himself

* Supply an introductory phrase suggesting a general comparison such as:

    > Think of what happened to Christ

**suffered:** There is a textual issue here:

1. Some Greek texts have died. For example:

    > died (GNT) *(RSV, NJB, NASB, CEV, NIV, GNT)*

2. Some Greek texts have suffered. For example:

    > suffered (NRSV) *(BSB, KJV, GW, ESV, NCV, NET, NIV11, NLT, NRSV, REB)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\). This has the strongest support from the ancient Greek manuscripts. The meaning of the two verbs, of course, is very similar. Christ’s suffering led to or resulted in his death.

**for sins:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *for sins* means here means “because of people’s sins” or “on account of other people’s sins.” Jesus himself had not sinned. Peter and his readers had all sinned, so in some languages it may natural to supply the pronoun “your(plur)” or “our”:

> for your(plur) sins

> for our(incl) sinsSome ancient Greek manuscripts do read “for your sins” or “for our sins.” This latter reading is followed by the REB, GW, NLT, and CEV.

**once for all:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *once for all* here means that Christ suffered only one time, and it was sufficient. (It does not mean “once for the sake of all people.”) Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> once for all time (NLT)

#### 3:18b

**the righteous for the unrighteous,**

* He was a good/just man, and he died for wicked/unjust people
* He was a person who did not do any bad thing, and he died on behalf of you people who do bad things

**the righteous for the unrighteous:** There is some implied information here. The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *the righteous for the unrighteous* is a shortened way of saying “Christ, who is righteous, died for the sake of other people, who are unrighteous.”

**righteous:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *righteous* here means “good” or “innocent.” Christ had done nothing for which he deserved to die. See how you translated *righteous* in 3:12\.

**for:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *for* here means “on behalf of” or “for the sake of.” For example:

> on behalf of (GNT)

**the unrighteous:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *the unrighteous* describes all people as sinful and guilty in God’s sight. Some other ways to translate *unrighteous* include:

> guilty people (GW)

> Sinners (NLT)

Peter’s readers were included among *the unrighteous*. It may therefore be natural to say here:

> you who are unrighteous

> you who are guilty

Before deciding which pronoun to supply, read the following note on the textual difficulty in 3:18c. The pronoun you use in 3:18b should agree with that in 3:18c.

#### 3:18c

**to bring you to God.**

* in order to lead you to God.
* so that he could bring you to a right relationship with God.

**to bring you to God:** There is a textual issue here:

1. Some Greek texts have you. For example:

    > so that he could bring you to God (GW) *(BSB, NIV, NRSV, NET, CEV, NCV, GW)*

2. Some Greek texts have us. For example:

    > that he might bring us to God (RSV) *(NJB, KJV, NASB, NLT, RSV)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\), which is favored by commentators. Make sure that your choice agrees with any pronoun you have supplied in 3:18b.

**to bring…to God:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *to bring…to God* means to lead someone into God’s presence, to reconcile someone with God. Some other ways this phrase has been translated are:

> to bring you safely home to God (NLT)

> in order to lead you to God (GNT)

#### 3:18d–e

Most of the modern versions start a new sentence here. These verse parts give the way/means by which Christ brought us to God.

#### 3:18d

**He was put to death in the body**

* This happened through people killing his body
* In the realm/sphere of the flesh men put him to death

**He was put to death in the body:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *body* is literally “flesh.” In this context this word probably refers to the world of physical, material things. People killed Jesus’ physical body made of flesh when they hung him on the cross. Here is another way to translate this:

> He was put to death physically (GNT)

The phrase *He was put to death* is passive. In some languages it may be necessary to use an active verb:

> People killed Christ’s fleshly/ physical body

#### 3:18e

**but made alive in the Spirit,**

* but he was brought to life in the spirit (REB)
* but in the spiritual realm/sphere God made him alive.

**made alive in the Spirit:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *by the Spirit* can be literally translates as “in/by spirit/Spirit.” There are three ways of understanding this word:

1. It refers to the spiritual realm, the sphere of spiritual life. For example:

    > he was made alive spiritually (GNT) *(GNT; probably RSV, NASB, REB, NJB, which all refer to “the spirit”)*

2. It refers to the Holy Spirit. For example:

    > he was raised to life in the Spirit (NLT) *(BSB, NIV, KJV, NLT, which all capitalize Spirit)*

3. It refers to Christ’s own human spirit. For example:

    > his spirit was made alive (CEV) *(GW, CEV, which say “his spirit”)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). Peter was probably referring to the sphere of spiritual things, the realm where the Spirit of God works unseen. This is in contrast to the physical world of flesh and material things mentioned in 3:18d.For a further discussion of this, see Kelly page 151; Michaels page 204; Selwyn pages 196–197\.

Some other headings for this section are:

#### 3:19–22

Verses 19–22 are difficult to understand. For more details of the debates, see the UBS Translator’s Handbook on 1 Peter. There is also a fairly long discussion in KBT on Translators Workplace, in the article on Spirit, sense A1(d). Because the interpretation of these verses is uncertain, it is best to translate them literally. Supply as little implied information as possible.

#### 3:19

**in whom He also went and preached to the spirits in prison**

* and in this way he went to the spirits who were guarded/imprisoned and preached to them.
* In this spiritual realm/sphere Christ went and declared/announced his victory to the spirits whom God was restricting/restraining.

**in whom:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *in whom* can also be translated as “in which.” Here it refers to the sphere of the Spirit and spiritual life mentioned in 3:18e. The GNT makes this explicit:

> in his spiritual existence (GNT)

**He also went and preached to the spirits in prison:** The Greek text does not say exactly where the spirits in prison were. One way to translate this is:

> he went to the spirits in prison and preached to them

**also:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *also* seems to function to introduce more information about the “spiritual realm” in 3:18e. It can also be translated as “even.” It is not translated in some versions such as the RSV. Translate it in a way that is natural in your language.

**preached:** The Greek verb that the BSB translates as *preached* can also be translated as “proclaimed” or “announced.” The text does not say what Christ proclaimed to the spirits in prison. Commentators suggest two possibilities:

1. Christ proclaimed his victory over the spiritual forces of darkness.
2. Christ preached about the need to repent and come to God for salvation.

If you must choose, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), which has the support of most commentaries. This is based on the interpretation of “spirits” as evil spiritual beings. See the following note for more information.

Some other ways *preached* can be translated are:

> proclaim his victory (GW)

> made a proclamation (NRSV)

**the spirits:** There are two ways to understand the Greek word that the BSB translates as *spirits*:

1. It refers to evil spiritual beings such as demons or fallen angels.
2. It refers to the souls of dead people.

It is recommended that you use an expression that could refer to either of these. If you must choose between them, it is recommended that you choose interpretation (1\). This is the normal meaning of *spirits* in the New Testament. It is also the view of the majority of modern commentators.For example, see Selwyn, pages 198–199; Michaels, pages 107–109; Achtemeier pages 260–261; Kelly pages 153–155; Marshall pages 125–127\. For an opposing view (that of Augustine and Aquinas) that Christ preached through Noah to the disobedient people alive in Noah’s time, see Grudem. Bigg (page 162–3\) believes that Christ here gave the spirits of dead people a chance to repent.

**in prison:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *prison* refers to a place where people are guarded and cannot leave. Presumably the spirits were *in prison* because they were waiting for God to judge them. Your translation should not give the idea that the spirits were in an earthly prison, but rather that they were held in some kind of custody so that they could not escape.

Some other ways to translate this phrase are:

> who are being held/restrained

> who are waiting for the judgment of God

#### 3:20a

**who disobeyed long ago**

* These spirits long ago disobeyed God,
* In ancient times these spirits refused to obey God.

**who disobeyed long ago:** In some languages it may be necessary to supply the implied information that these spirits disobeyed God:

> they disobeyed God long ago

**long ago:** In this context the phrase *long ago* refers to ancient times (the time of Noah), a few thousand years before Peter wrote. Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> in the past (REB)

#### 3:20b

**when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built.**

* in Noah’s time, when God waited patiently while Noah’s people were building the big boat.
* This happened while Noah was building the ark, when God was waiting patiently for people to repent.

**when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built:** Peter was referring to the story in Genesis 6–8\. God told Noah to build an ark to escape the flood he was going to send on the earth. While Noah and his family were building the ark, God waited patiently for other people to repent from their sins. But none of them repented.

**God waited patiently:** *God waited patiently* for other people to repent from their sins. But none of them repented.

**ark:** An *ark* is large boat. Some versions such as the NLT have:

> boat (NLT)

#### 3:20c

**In the ark a few people, only eight souls, were saved through water.**

* Only a few people, a total of eight, entered the boat and were brought safely through the water.
* In this ark there were just a few people, a total of eight. God brought them safely through the flood water,

**In the ark:** The phrase that the BSB translates as *In the ark* is literally “in which.” The Greek sentence continues into this verse part. It may be helpful in your language to start a new sentence here, as the BSB does.

**a few people, only eight souls:** In your translation use an expression that indicates that *eight* is a small number of people compared to the number of people who died in the flood. For example:

> not very many people, a total of only eight

**were saved through water:** There are several ways of understanding the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *saved through water*:

1. Noah and his family reached safety by passing through the water. In other words, they experienced the flood and survived. For example:

    > were brought safely through the water (RSV) *(BSB, NIV, NJB, NASB, REB, NET, CEV, RSV)*

2. Noah and his family were saved by means of the water. It was the water that lifted and carried the ark. For example:

    > were saved by the water (GNT) *(KJV, GW, GNT, NCV)*

3. Noah and his family were saved from the water. For example:

    > saved from drowning in that terrible flood (NLT) *(NLT)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). Noah and his family *were saved through water* in the sense that God preserved their lives as they lived through the flood.

**were saved:** This is a passive verb. It was God who saved Noah and his family. If it is more natural in your language to use an active verb here, you could say:

> they escaped

> God saved them

#### 3:21a

**And this water symbolizes the baptism that now saves you also—**

* This/That water represents the water of baptism. It is baptism which saves you now from your sins.
* which is a picture/illustration of baptism. It is baptism which now causes you to escape from punishment for your sins.

**And:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *And* here introduces a new thought on the same topic. In some languages it may be more natural to begin a new sentence here, as the BSB and some other versions do. For example:

> And that water is a picture of baptism… (NLT)

**this water symbolizes the baptism that now saves you also:** Peter was saying that Noah’s flood pointed forward in some way to Christian baptism. There are various ways of expressing this:

> which was a symbol pointing to baptism, which now saves you (GNT)

> baptism, which this prefigured, now saves you (NRSV)

> It is the baptism corresponding to this water which saves you now (NJB)

**this water symbolizes the baptism:** The Greek text that the BSB translates as *this water symbolizes the baptism* is literally “this/which is an antitype/symbol of baptism.” The BSB has supplied the word *water*. “This/which” can also be understood as referring to the whole experience of passing through the flood. This is implied by the NET (context is given), which says:

> 20cIn the ark a few, that is eight souls, were delivered through water. 21aAnd this prefigured baptism… (NET)

**symbolizes:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *symbolizes* in this context refers to representing something that is still future. Consider how you might say that something represents or illustrates something else that has not happened yet. Some other ways *symbolizes* has been translated are:

> is a picture of (NLT)

> is like (NCV)

> which corresponds to (RSV)

**baptism:** The word *baptism* refers to the ceremony of ritual washing to purify someone or something. It is connected to a person being purified from sin.

In translating this word, be sure to choose a term that is acceptable to all the churches in your area. Unless there is a term already in use by all churches, it may be better to borrow the word from Greek or your national language.

Here are some ways to translate *baptism*:

* Use a descriptive phrase:

    > sacred washing

    > purification/initiation for God

    > entering water

* Use a term for a similar ritual that is already part of your culture. You may need to indicate that in this context it has a special connection with God. For example:

    > God’s ceremonial bath

    > initiation washing for God

* Use a term that is already accepted by the local churches. In some areas this term may have been borrowed from the national language or transliterated from Greek or English.

In some languages you may need to use a verb to translate *baptism*. For example:

> ritually wash/clean

> initiate people in/with water

> purify people in God’s ceremonial bath

**that now saves you also:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *saves* means to rescue someone from danger or trouble. In this context, *saves* is being used in a very general way. The act of receiving baptism does not directly save a person. Baptism is an outward symbol of what God does when he cleanses a person, raises him from spiritual death, and gives him new life.

Some other ways to translate *saves* include:

> rescues

> causes you to escape

#### 3:21b

**not the removal of dirt from the body,**

* Baptism is not about getting rid of dirt from the body.
* Being baptised is not a matter of cleaning the body,

**not the removal of dirt from the body:** The phrase *not the removal of dirt from the body* means “baptism is not about removing dirt from your body.” Baptism was a form of ritual washing, but it was not the cleaning of the body that was important. Some other ways this phrase has been translated include:

> not the washing of dirt from the body (NCV)

> more than just washing your body (CEV)

#### 3:21c

**but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God—**

* No, it is about appealing to God to give you a clear/clean conscience.
* but rather it is a matter of asking God to cleanse your hearts.

**but:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *but* introduces a contrast. Peter had just said in 3:21b what aspect of baptism was not important, and now in 3:31c he states what aspect of baptism is important. Translate this contrast in a way that is natural in your language.

**the pledge of a clear conscience:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *pledge* literally means “request” or “appeal.” In this context it can mean “promise,” “appeal,” or “answer.” There are therefore several ways of understanding the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *the pledge of a clear conscience*:

1. It means “asking for a clear conscience.” For example:

    > an appeal to God for a clear conscience (RSV) *(NASB, GW, RSV)*

2. It means “making a promise from a clean conscience.” For example:

    > the promise made to God from a good conscience (GNT) *(NET, NCV, GNT; probably NJB, NIV)*

3. It means “promising to live with a clear conscience.” This interpretation has the strongest support from biblical scholars.This understanding is suggested by Marshall page 131; Best page 148; Achtemeier page 270–272; Kelly page 163\. It is a possible understanding of the NJB:

    > the pledge of a good conscience (NJB) *(possibly BSB, NIV, NJB)*

4. It means “asking for salvation/forgiveness from a clear conscience.” For example:

    > the appeal made to God from a good conscience (REB) *(NLT, REB)*

5. It means “responding from a clear conscience.” For example:

    > the answer of a good conscience (KJV) *(KJV, probably CEV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). However, any of the interpretations are possible, and you may wish to consult the major language version in your area.

**toward God:** There are two ways of understanding the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *toward God*:

1. It means *toward God* and modifies the phrase “good conscience.” For example:

    > the pledge of a good conscience toward God (NIV) *(BSB, NIV, KJV, GNT, NJB, CEV, NCV, REB, NET)*

2. It means to God and modifies the word “pledge/appeal/answer.” For example:

    > an appeal to God for a good conscience (NASB) *(RSV, NLT, GW, NCV, NASB)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), which has more commentary support.

#### 3:21d

**through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,**

* This baptism saves you because Jesus Christ has risen from the dead.
* Jesus Christ has come alive from the dead. That is why you can be saved as you receive baptism.

**through the resurrection of Jesus Christ:** The BSB has associated this verse part with 3:21a by setting off 3:21b and 3:21c with dashes.

In this verse part Peter explained how being baptized could be said to save a person. It is because Jesus Christ has been raised from the dead that people who are baptized are saved.

**the resurrection of Jesus Christ:** The phrase *the resurrection* refers to the event when God caused Jesus to live again. Some other ways *resurrection* can be translated are:

> rise from the dead

> come alive from the dead

> God caused…to live again

**who has gone into heaven:** Jesus Christ went into heaven forty days after he came alive from the dead. This is described in Acts 1:1–10\.

**heaven:** The word *heaven* here refers to the dwelling place of God, outside our universe. Some other ways to translate this word are:

> the place of God

> the place where God lives

**and is at the right hand of God:** Peter did not say whether Jesus was standing or sitting at God’s right hand. If it is necessary for you to make this explicit, it is recommended that you supply the information that he is seated (see Ephesians 1:20 and Colossians 3:1\). For example:

> and is sitting/seated at God’s right hand

**right hand:** This was the most important position in Jewish culture, but in other cultures the left side is the more important. If neither side is more important in your culture, you could translate *right hand* as:

> the place of highest honor

#### 3:22b

**with angels, authorities, and powers subject to Him.**

* There he rules over angels and all beings/spirits that have authority and power.
* All the angelic begins, spirit beings with authority and power are under his authority/power.

**with angels, authorities, and powers subject to Him:** In some languages it may be natural to translate this as a separate clause with its own verb:

> and angels, authorities and powers submit to him

**angels, authorities, and powers:** The phrase *angels, authorities, and powers* includes all supernatural beings, whether good or bad.

**angels:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *angels* means “messengers.” It refers here to spirit beings who serve God. Sometimes God sends an angel to tell a message to human beings. He also sends angels to serve him in other ways. Some ways to translate this term are:

* Use a descriptive word or phrase. For example:

    > messengers from God/heaven

    > good/holy spirit\-beings

* Use a local term that fits the biblical meaning.
* In some areas the churches may already be using a borrowed term or a transliterated word for “angel.” Be sure that this term fits the biblical meaning. If some people do not understand the right meaning from this term, you may need to indicate the meaning in some way. For example:

    > an *angelos* messenger from God

    > a sacred *angelos* spirit

Be sure that your term for “angel” is different from your terms for “prophet” and “apostle.”

**authorities, and powers:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *authorities, and powers* refers to supernatural forces that were believed to affect the lives of people. Some other ways to translate this phrase are:

> spirits in the sky who have authority and power

> supernatural beings who have authority and power

**subject to Him:** The phrase *subject to him* here means “recognizing Christ’s authority”; that is, obeying him. Some other ways to translate this phrase are:

> under his control (CEV)

> ruling over all angels and heavenly authorities and powers (GNT)

* **Associated Passages:** 1PE 3:22

## 1 Peter 4:1 (id: 474559)

### Section 4:1–6: Christians should live to please God

In this section, Peter continued with the theme of suffering as followers of Christ. He urges his readers to follow Christ’s example and be willing to suffer for doing right and so avoid sinning. They must not follow the bad behavior of their pagan neighbors, who will be judged by God, but they should live according to God’s will.

Some other headings for this section are:

> Change your lives (NCV)

> Being Faithful to God (CEV)

#### 4:1a

**Therefore, since Christ suffered in His body,**

* ¶ So then, since Christ suffered in his body/flesh,
* ¶ You know that Christ’s body received suffering. Therefore
* ¶ Christ suffered physically when he died on the cross, and so

**Therefore:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Therefore* introduces something that Peter’s readers should do as a result of what he had earlier said. It is also possible to translate this as:

> So then

**since Christ suffered in His body:** By using this phrase Peter was reminding his readers of what he had said in 3:18\. The fact that Christ *suffered in His body* was the basis for what he was about to command his readers.

**Christ suffered in His body:** The Greek expression that the BSB translates as *Christ suffered in His body* means that Christ suffered physically. It is probably referring specifically to Christ’s death on the cross. Refer back to your translation of 3:18d, where the same word (“flesh”) is used for *body*. Other translation models include:

> Christ endured bodily suffering (REB)

> Christ suffered physically (GNT)

#### 4:1b

**arm yourselves with the same resolve,**

* you should make yourselves strong by thinking in the same way he did.
* you must prepare yourselves to suffer as he was willing to suffer.

**arm yourselves with the same resolve:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *arm yourselves also with the same attitude* means to prepare yourself for suffering by thinking in the right way, just as Christ did.

In some languages it may be natural to make explicit what the same attitude was. For example

> Now you must be ready to suffer as he did (CEV)

In some languages it may be necessary to say something like:

> Think in the same way that Christ thought, and so strengthen/prepare yourselves for suffering

**arm yourselves:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *arm yourselves* is a military term meaning to equip or provide oneself with weapons. Peter wanted his readers to strengthen and prepare themselves for what they might have to suffer.The Greek text includes the word *kai*, which means “too” or “also,” that is, you as well as Christ are to arm yourself with Christ’s attitude. The GNT has translated this explicitly, but in many languages this may not be natural. It is not natural in English to use “too” as well as “the same” (as this implies a comparison to an unmentioned/unknown third person), and so most English versions do not translate it. Some other ways to translate *arm yourselves* are:

> strengthen yourselves (NCV)

> be ready (GNT)

**the same resolve:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *resolve* refers to the way in which Christ thought. He was willing to suffer and die on the cross. It can also be translated as:

> thought (RSV)

> way of thinking (GNT)

In some languages it may be necessary to translate it as a verb phrase. For example:

> Think in the same way that Christ thought

#### 4:1c

**because anyone who has suffered in his body is done with sin.**

* For the person whose body has suffered for resisting sin has rejected/renounced sin.
* For anyone who has suffered persecution has shown that he is determined not to sin.

**because anyone who has suffered in his body is done with sin:** There are two ways of interpreting the Greek word that the BSB translates as *because*:

1. It means for or because and introduces the reason for Christ’s attitude. For example:

    > for whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin (RSV) *(BSB, KJV, NASB, NIV, NET, NLT, CEV, RSV)*

2. It means that and introduces the content of Christ’s attitude. For example:

    > \[the same conviction] that anyone who has undergone bodily suffering has broken with sin (NJB) *(GW, NJB)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), along with the majority of English versions and commentary support.

**anyone who has suffered in his body:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *anyone who has suffered in his body* is literally “the one who has suffered in flesh.” In this context it refers to someone who has suffered physically because of persecution. This could include being beaten or nor receiving food. Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> whoever suffers physically (NLT)

**is done with sin:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *is done with sin* in this context means “has renounced/ rejected sin.” A person who is willing to suffer persecution because of Christ has shown that he has renounced sin. He wants to obey Christ whatever happens. He has decided it is better to suffer than to sin. An English idiom that expresses this is:

> has made a clean break with sin

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> is finished with sin (NCV)

In some languages it may be necessary to translate *sin* as a verb. For example:

> is determined to stop sinning

* **Associated Passages:** 1PE 4:1

## 1 Peter 4:2 (id: 474560)

### Section 4:1–6: Christians should live to please God

In this section, Peter continued with the theme of suffering as followers of Christ. He urges his readers to follow Christ’s example and be willing to suffer for doing right and so avoid sinning. They must not follow the bad behavior of their pagan neighbors, who will be judged by God, but they should live according to God’s will.

Some other headings for this section are:

> Change your lives (NCV)

> Being Faithful to God (CEV)

#### 4:2a

**Consequently, he does not live out his remaining time on earth for human passions,**

* From now on, he should live the rest of his life not controlled by his own desires,
* It means that for the rest of his life he has turned from his own evil desires

#### 4:2b

**but for the will of God.**

* but instead anxious to do the will of God.
* and wants to obey God instead.

#### 4:2a–b

**Consequently:** There are three ways of interpreting the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *Consequently*:

1. It introduces purpose: For example:

    > so that you will live here on earth doing what God wants (NCV) *(RSV, NASB, REB, KJV, NCV)See Achtemeier page 280; Kelly page 169; Best page 152; Michaels page 229\.*

2. It introduces result. For example:

    > From now on, then, you must live the rest of your earthly lives controlled by God’s will and not by human desires. (GNT) *(BSB, NIV, GW, GNT; possibly NLT)*

3. It introduces an explanation of the meaning of “he who has suffered in his body has done with sin.” For example:

    > \[has finished with sin] in that he spends the rest of his time on earth concerned about the will of God and not human desires. (NET) *(CEV, NJB, NET; possibly NLT)See Selwyn, page 210: “This…sentence illustrates what the author means by ceasing from sins.” The boundary between interpretations (1\) and (2\) is not always clear.*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). This is the view of the majority of commentators. A Christian renounces or rejects sin so that he or she may live in a way that pleases God.

**he does not live out his remaining time on earth for human passions, but for the will of God:** In some languages in may be natural to put the positive statement before the negative:

> he lives the rest of his earthly life for the will of God, not for evil human desires

**not…for human passions:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *not…for human passions* here means “not trying to do wrong things any more.” Other ways of translating this include:

> no longer concerned about the evil things people desire

> not guided/controlled by sinful human desires (GW)

**human passions:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *human passions* is simply “desires.” This word generally implies wrong or selfish desires. Some translations such as the NIV make that explicit by saying “evil desires.” See also the note on 1:14b, where the same word is used. In some languages it may be possible to use a word that itself implies that the desires are wrong. For example:

> bad things (EASY)

> lusts

**his remaining time on earth:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *his remaining time on earth* is literally “the remaining time in flesh.” It refers to a person’s life on earth after he renounces sin. Some other ways to translate this phrase are:

> the rest of your lives on earth (GW)

> the rest of your time here in the world

##### **General Comment on 4:1–2**

The BSB, like the Greek, switches from the second person (“you”) to the third person (“he”) in 4:1c–2 and then back to the second person again in 4:3\. In some languages it may be natural to use second person pronouns throughout. For example, the CEV translates 4:1–2 as:

> 1Christ suffered here on earth. Now you must be ready to suffer as he did, because suffering shows that you have stopped sinning. 2It means you have turned from your own desires and want to obey God for the rest of your life. (CEV)

* **Associated Passages:** 1PE 4:2

## 1 Peter 4:3 (id: 474561)

### Section 4:1–6: Christians should live to please God

In this section, Peter continued with the theme of suffering as followers of Christ. He urges his readers to follow Christ’s example and be willing to suffer for doing right and so avoid sinning. They must not follow the bad behavior of their pagan neighbors, who will be judged by God, but they should live according to God’s will.

Some other headings for this section are:

> Change your lives (NCV)

> Being Faithful to God (CEV)

#### 4:3a

**For you have spent enough time in the past carrying out the same desires as the Gentiles:**

* For you used to waste your time behaving in the way that heathen people choose.
* Before you became Christians, you wrongly spent much time joining with other unbelievers/pagans in doing the bad things they like to do.

**For:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *For* here introduces a reason why Peter’s readers should no longer live to fulfill their human desires. Translate this conjunction in a way that is natural to introduce a reason in your language.

**you have spent enough time in the past carrying out the same desires as the Gentiles:** A literal translation may imply that the way Peter’s readers spent their time in the past was fine, and now sufficient. However, that is not what Peter meant. He disapproved of how his readers had lived in the past. You may need to make this clear by translating this as:

> In the past you spent your time wrongly, doing what pagans choose to do

> In the past you wasted too much time doing what nonbelievers enjoy (NCV)

**in the past:** The phrase *in the past* refers to the time before the readers of this letter became Christians. Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> You have already lived long enough (CEV)

**the same desires as the Gentiles:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *the same desires as the Gentiles* is more literally “the will/desire of the nations/pagans.” This uses a different word for “desire” than that in 4:2, but it refers to the same thing. Before they became Christians, Peter’s readers did whatever they wanted to do, not what God wanted them to do.

**Gentiles:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *Gentiles* is literally “the nations.” It refers to non\-Jewish peoples who did not worship the true God. Some other ways to translate this word include:

> people who don’t know God (CEV)

> godless people (NLT)

#### 4:3b–d

In these verse parts Peter mentioned some of the sins that were common among the pagans. Not every one of Peter’s readers had done all of these bad things, but these were the sort of things they often used to do. In your translation, use terms that show that Peter was disgusted with all these ways of behaving.

#### 4:3b

**living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness,**

* You sinned sexually, you desired evil things, you drank too much wine,
* You lived immorally, the desires of your bodies ruled you, and you were often drunk.

**debauchery:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *debauchery* refers to shameful sexual behavior in which the person shows no self control. Other ways to translate this include:

> sexual sins (NCV)

> you were promiscuous (GW)

> you were immoral (CEV)

**lust:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *lust* refers to strong, impure sexual desires. Other translation suggestions include:

> evil desires (NCV)

> giving way to your passions (NJB)

> you…followed your evil desires (CEV)

**drunkenness:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *drunkenness* refers to habitually drinking too much wine or other alcoholic drinks. Another way to translate this is:

> always getting drunk

##### **General Comment on 4:3b**

In some languages it may be natural to reverse the order of the first two items in this list. For example:

> You followed your lusts and committed sexual sins. You lived in drunkenness….

#### 4:3c

**orgies, carousing,**

* you went to wild parties and got drunk,
* You were feasting and drinking wine without controlling yourselves.

**orgies, carousing:** The Greek words that the BSB translates as *orgies* and *carousing* are similar in meaning and refer to feasts where people eat and drink too much and behave without any control. Here is another way to translate these words:

> having wild parties and drunken orgies (NJB)

Some translations combine the two ideas into one noun phrase, For example:

> wild and drunken parties (NCV)

#### 4:3d

**and detestable idolatry.**

* and joined in the forbidden worship of false gods.
* You worshipped detestable/disgusting idols.

**detestable idolatry:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *detestable* is literally “against the law.” Here it describes behavior that God had forbidden and could therefore be considered shocking and disgusting. If your language has a word meaning “outside the boundaries of law,” you might be able to use it here. Try to use a word that implies something is to be rejected as repulsive. Other English translation models include:

> the forbidden worship of idols (REB)

> the disgusting worship of idols (GNT)

> doing shameful things in your worship of idols

##### **General Comment on 4:3b–d**

In the Greek, as in the BSB, the different evil behaviors are all listed as abstract nouns. In some languages it may be necessary to use verb phrases. For example:

> You sinned sexually and followed your evil passions. You got drunk and went to wild drinking parties. You stepped over God’s boundaries by worshiping idols.

## 1 Peter 4:4 (id: 474562)

### Section 4:1–6: Christians should live to please God

In this section, Peter continued with the theme of suffering as followers of Christ. He urges his readers to follow Christ’s example and be willing to suffer for doing right and so avoid sinning. They must not follow the bad behavior of their pagan neighbors, who will be judged by God, but they should live according to God’s will.

Some other headings for this section are:

> Change your lives (NCV)

> Being Faithful to God (CEV)

#### 4:4a

**Because of this, they consider it strange**

* So, the heathen think it very odd/peculiar
* But now those who do not believe in the true God are very surprised to see

**Because of this:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *Because of this* refers back to the fact that “in the past” (4:3a) these believers used to do wrong things. Another way to translate this is:

> Because you used to do these things

**they consider it strange:** The pagans thought the behavior of the Christian believers was unusual in a bad sense. The sins mentioned in 4:3b–d were acceptable in their culture. This was how many people behaved and they wanted everyone to behave like that. Some other ways to translate this are:

> They are astonished (NET)

> they are surprised (GW)

#### 4:4b

**of you not to plunge with them into the same flood of reckless indiscretion,**

* that you no longer join with them when they behave with such total lack of restraint,
* that you reject any involvement in their reckless and sinful lifestyle,

**of you not to plunge with them into the same flood of reckless indiscretion:** This is a figure of speech. It means “you are not associating with them in all these many sins.” In some languages it may be natural to translate this as a positive statement:

> you refuse to get involved in their unrestrained and sinful lifestyle

**to plunge with them:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *plunge with them* is literally “run together with them.” It is a figure of speech meaning “eager to join them.” Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> that you do not now join them (RSV)

**flood of reckless indiscretion:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates literally as *flood of dissipation* is a figure of speech. It summarizes how the pagans lived. There were no limits to the shameful things they did. Some English translations do not use the metaphor of a *flood*. For example:

> the many wild and wasteful things they do (NCV)

Consider if it is natural in your language to keep the flood metaphor.

**reckless indiscretion:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *reckless indiscretion* means “unrestrained riotous behavior.” The word occurs also in Luke 15:13\. Some other ways it is translated include:

> wild and reckless living (GNT)

> the many wild and wasteful things (NCV)

#### 4:4c

**and they heap abuse on you.**

* and they revile you.
* and so they speak evil of you.

**and:** The BSB has supplied the word *and*. The GNT has supplied the phrase “and so.” Both versions do this in order to make the connection between 4:4b and 4:4c clear. The pagans heaped abuse on the believers because the believers refused to get involved in their sinful lifestyle. Translate this connection in your language in a way that is natural.

**they heap abuse on you:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *they heap abuse on you* means “they speak evil of you.” It is a strong word that is often used of sinning by speaking evil of something that is holy. Some other ways to translate this are:

> they insult you (GNT)

> they curse you for it (CEV)

* **Associated Passages:** 1PE 4:4

## 1 Peter 4:5 (id: 474563)

### Section 4:1–6: Christians should live to please God

In this section, Peter continued with the theme of suffering as followers of Christ. He urges his readers to follow Christ’s example and be willing to suffer for doing right and so avoid sinning. They must not follow the bad behavior of their pagan neighbors, who will be judged by God, but they should live according to God’s will.

Some other headings for this section are:

> Change your lives (NCV)

> Being Faithful to God (CEV)

#### 4:5a

**But they will have to give an account**

* But they will have to answer for their behavior
* However one day they will be obliged/forced to explain what they have done

**But:** In the Greek text the sentence that began at 4:4a continues here. The BSB and many other English versions begin a new sentence here and supply the word *But* to connect this sentence to the previous one. It is recommended that you begin a new sentence here in a way that is natural for your language.

**they will have to give an account:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *they will have to give an account* means “they will have to explain/justify their actions.” The pronoun *they* refers to the non\-Christians in 4:4\. People are responsible to God for how they act. At the end of the world he will call upon everyone to examine how they have lived their lives.

Some other ways this phrase has been translated include:

> they will have to explain this (NCV)

> they will have to answer (CEV)

#### 4:5b

**to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.**

* to the one who is prepared to judge those people who are alive and those who are dead.
* to God, who will soon judge people who are alive and those who have died.

**to Him who is ready to judge:** There are two ways of interpreting the pronoun *Him* here:

1. It refers to God, as in 1:17 and 2:23\. For example:

    > God, who is ready to judge (NCV) *(CEV, NLT, GNT, NCV)*

2. It refers to Christ. In several other verses in the New Testament he is spoken of as the judge (see Acts 10:42, 2 Timothy 4:1\). For example:

    > Jesus Christ, who stands ready to judge (NET) *(NET)*

Several English versions are ambiguous (BSB, NIV, RSV, NASB, NJB, GW). Either option is acceptable. If you must choose between the two options, it is recommended that you follow your national translation.

**who is ready to judge:** The phrase *who is ready to judge* implies that the judgment will take place soon. Christ will return before long, and then the final judgment will take place. Another way to translate this phrase is:

> God who will soon judge

**the living and the dead:** The phrase *the living and the dead* refers to those people who would be alive at the time of the judgment and those who would be already dead. Peter used this phrase in order to include all people throughout all of human history. Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> everyone, both the living and the dead (NLT)

* **Associated Passages:** 1PE 4:5

## 1 Peter 4:6 (id: 474564)

### Section 4:1–6: Christians should live to please God

In this section, Peter continued with the theme of suffering as followers of Christ. He urges his readers to follow Christ’s example and be willing to suffer for doing right and so avoid sinning. They must not follow the bad behavior of their pagan neighbors, who will be judged by God, but they should live according to God’s will.

Some other headings for this section are:

> Change your lives (NCV)

> Being Faithful to God (CEV)

#### 4:6

This is a difficult verse to understand, and there are many different interpretations. A clear explanation of these is given in the UBS Translator’s Handbook. Apparently Peter was saying that the gospel was preached to people who are now dead during the time when they were still alive. Although these people died as all people do, God is able to give them true spiritual life, so they might live as he lives.

#### 4:6a

**That is why the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead,**

* For this is why Christ’s followers preached the Good News to those who are now dead,
* This is the reason believers preached the gospel about Jesus to the people who have now died as well,

There is a Greek conjunction meaning “For” at the beginning of this verse that connects it in a general way with 4:1–5\. Some English versions do not translate it explicitly (BSB, CEV, GNT, NCV, REB). Connect 4:6 to 4:1–5 in a way that is natural in your language.

**That is why:** There are two ways of understanding the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *That is why*:

1. It looks forward to the rest of the verse. The reason is given in 4:6c. For example:

    > 6ait was for this very purpose…6bso that…6cthey may live spiritually (NET) *(BSB, CEV, KJV, NASB, RSV, NET; possibly NIV)*

2. It looks backward, to what Peter had just said. For example:

    > That is why (GNT) *(GNT, NCV, REB; possibly NJB)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). The phrase *That is why* is referring to the purpose introduced by “so that” in 4:6b.

**the gospel was preached:** This is a passive verb. Peter did not say who preached the gospel. If you must provide a subject, it is recommended that you provide a general one such as:

> they

> people

If you must be more specific, you could say:

> Christ’s followers/disciples

**even to those who are now dead:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *even* can also be translated as “as well” or “also.” That is, the gospel was preached to the dead as well as to the living. The NJB translates it in this way and says:

> the gospel was brought to the dead as well (NJB)

**who are now dead:** Peter did not say which dead people he was thinking of. Probably he was thinking of people who had heard the gospel while they were alive and had since died. Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> to the dead (GNT)

#### 4:6b

**so that they might be judged as men in the flesh,**

* so that although they were judged like men in their physical bodies,
* so that although God judged them and they died physically as all men do,

**so that:** The phrase *so that* introduces a purpose clause. The purpose is in 4:6c. The GNT therefore puts the purpose marker in 4:6c. You should translate this phrase in a way that naturally introduces a purpose in your language.

**they might be judged as men in the flesh:** Peter was implying that these people died as a result of being judged. It was because they had received punishment *as men in the flesh* that they were now dead.

This clause is not the purpose introduced by “so that.” It is a concessive clauseA concessive clause is a clause that in English begins with “although” or “even though” and expresses an idea that suggests the opposite of the main part of the sentence. and means “although they were judged….” Here is another way to translate this:

> though judged in the flesh like men (RSV)

**they might be judged:** This is also a passive verb. Peter did not say who would judge these people. Probably he was thinking of God, as in 4:5\. Another way to translate this is:

> that God might judge them

**as men:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *as men* in this context probably means “like all men” or “as sinful human beings.” For example:

> as everyone is judged (GNT)

**in the flesh:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *in the flesh* in this context means “physically” or “in their flesh.” This is the same word for “flesh” that is used in 3:18d and 4:2a–b (where it is translated by the BSB as “remaining time on earth”). These people died on earth. There was no longer any life in their bodies. Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> in their physical existence (GNT)

#### 4:6c

**but live according to God in the spirit.**

* their spirits may live in heaven, as God lives.
* they may live spiritually like God.

**but:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *but* introduces the second half of a contrast. The contrast is between being judged in their physical existence in 4:6b and living spiritually in 4:6c.

In accordance with English style, translations such as the RSV that have used “though/although” in 4:6b do not translate this explicitly. Translate this contrast in a way that is natural in your language.

**live according to God in the spirit:** This is a contrast with what happened in 4:6b. God could make these people alive again in the realm of the spirit. Here is another way to translate this:

> in their spiritual existence they may live as God lives (GNT)

**according to God:** This is a contrast with “as men” in 4:6b. Although these people died as all men die, because they had received the gospel, they could live as God lives. Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> like God (RSV)

**in the spirit:** The phrase *in the spirit* is in contrast with “in the flesh” in 4:6b. It is referring to what happens in the spiritual realm, that is, in heaven or in eternity.

See also the notes on 3:18d and 3:18e, where the same contrast occurs between what happened in the body and what happened in the spirit.

**The end of all things is near:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *The end of all things is near* means this whole physical universe will soon come to an end. It will not disappear, but God will transform and renew it. Other ways of translating this include:

> The time is near when all things will end (NCV)

> Everything will soon come to an end (CEV)

> the culmination of all things is near (NET)

**end of all things:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *end* refers to a goal or culmination rather than a complete finish. The *end* Peter is talking of is the goal towards which God is working. This will lead to the transformation of our physical world and our physical life into a new world and a spiritual life. The *end of all things* thus means the coming of better things rather than nothingness. Some other ways to translate this are:

> The culmination of all things (NET)

> The accomplishing of the goal of all things (CJB)

#### 4:7b

**Therefore be clear\-minded and sober, so that you can pray.**

* So think clearly and be alert, so that you pray to God in the right way.

**Therefore:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Therefore* introduces Peter’s words of teaching based on what he had just written in 4:7a. Other ways you might be able to say this include:

> So (CEV)

> Because of this

See how you translated this word in 1:13a and 2:1a.

**be clear\-minded and sober:** The Greek words translated as *clear\-minded* and *sober* are similar in meaning. It may be possible to combine them in some way. Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> keep your minds calm and sober (NJB)

**clear\-minded:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *clear\-minded* means sane, serious, keeping one’s head. Other translations say:

> be serious (NRSV)

> earnest (NLT)

**sober:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *sober* means being well balanced, well disciplined, keeping one’s eyes on the goal. This second word occurs also in 1:13b. Other translations have:

> alert (GNT)

> discipline yourselves (NRSV)

> sensible (CEV)

**so that you can pray:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *so that you can pray* is literally “for prayers,” that is, for the sake of your prayers to God. It means “in order to be able to pray” or “so that you can concentrate on praying to God.” Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> so you will be able to pray (NCV)

##### **General Comment on 4:7b**

In some languages it may be helpful to reverse the order of the phrases. For example:

> to help you pray you must lead self\-controlled and sober lives (REB)

### Section 4:7–11: Good managers of God’s gifts

In this section, Peter said that the end of the world is near, and therefore Christians should be self\-controlled and prayerful. They should love each other, be hospitable, and use their special abilities to help each other. In this way they would bring glory to God.

Some other headings for this section include:

> Use God’s Gifts Wisely (NCV)

> Your attitude in these last days

#### 4:8a

**Above all, love one another deeply,**

* Most important of all, love each other warmly/heartily,
* It is vital that you love one another with all your hearts,

**Above all:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *Above all* here means that what Peter is about to say is very important. He is not necessarily saying that what he is about to say is more important than what he has just said. Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> Most important of all (CEV)

**love one another deeply:** The Greek word translated as *deeply* intensifies the command to love each other. Peter wanted his readers to care a lot about one another. You could also translate this as:

> warmly (GW)

> sincerely (CEV)

> fervently

This word also occurred in 1:22\. See how you translated it there.

#### 4:8b

**because love covers over a multitude of sins.**

* because your love will cancel/remove many sins.
* because if you love people, you will keep on forgiving their sins.

**because:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *because* explains the reason why believers are to “love each other deeply” in 4:8b. This reason is stated here in this verse part. Connect 4:8b to 4:8a in a way that is natural in your language. Other ways that is word is translated include:

> for (NLT)

> Since (RSV)

**love covers over a multitude of sins:** This may be a proverb that was in common use in New \`Testament times. See Proverbs 10:12 and James 5:20\. In this context it can be interpreted in two ways:

1. If a person loves other people, he forgives and forgets the wrong they have done to him. For example:

    > NET footnote: “Christian love is patient and forgiving towards the offences of a fellow Christian.” *(NET)*

2. If you love one another, God will forgive your sins. This is perhaps implied by the NCV:

    > love will cause many sins to be forgiven *(NCV)*

Most English translations do not say explicitly who loves and whose sins are covered. However, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). The person who loves a fellow Christian covers or forgives their sins. This is the view of the majority of modern commentators.See Achtemeier page 296; Grudem page 173; Best page 159; Davids; Michaels page 247 is somewhat different: He says that through Christian love “sin as a social phenomenon can be blotted out.”

**covers over:** In this context, *covers over* means “forgives.” A literal translation may suggest that sins are hidden, that is, concealed or kept secret. That is not what Peter meant here. A person who wishes his sins to be covered may first need to confess them to God and other people. Some other ways *covers over* has been translated are:

> cancels (REB)

> wipes away (CEV)

**a multitude:** The phrase *a multitude* means “many.” However, a literal translation may imply that there will be sins the believer can choose not to forgive. This is not the meaning here. In some languages, it may therefore be necessary to translate this as part of the verb, indicating that the one who loves forgives sins frequently or regularly. For example:

> you will keep on forgiving their sins

### Section 4:7–11: Good managers of God’s gifts

In this section, Peter said that the end of the world is near, and therefore Christians should be self\-controlled and prayerful. They should love each other, be hospitable, and use their special abilities to help each other. In this way they would bring glory to God.

Some other headings for this section include:

> Use God’s Gifts Wisely (NCV)

> Your attitude in these last days

#### 4:9a

**Show hospitality to one another**

* Welcome one another into your houses.
* Invite other believers into your homes.

**Show hospitality to one another:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *Show hospitality to one another* refers to receiving other believers as guests in one’s home. This would involve giving them food and a place to sleep. Other ways to say this include:

> Welcome each other into your houses (NJB)

> Open your homes to each other (NCV)

#### 4:9b

**without complaining.**

* Do not complain about doing this.
* Do this willingly/cheerfully.

**without complaining:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *without complaining* means that Christians should not grumble about having to give meals and lodging to other believers. In some languages it may be natural to translate this positively. For example:

> cheerfully (NLT)

> be happy to have other believers as visitors in your homes (EASY)

#### 4:10a

**As good stewards of the manifold grace of God,**

* Be good stewards/managers of the various gifts that God has given you.
* I want all of you to use God’s different gifts well.

**As good stewards of the manifold grace of God:** A “steward” was a servant or employee who looked after or administered another person’s property. So by calling his readers *good stewards of the manifold grace of God*, Peter was saying that Christians are to use wisely what God has graciously entrusted to them. Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> as a good manager of God’s…gifts (GNT)

**the manifold grace of God:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *the manifold grace of God* is literally “God’s varied grace.” Peter meant that the grace was expressed in different gifts, so it may be necessary to translate this as:

> God’s various gifts of grace (NCV)

**the…grace of God:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *the…grace of God* refers to the gifts that God has graciously given to each of his people. Another way to translate this phrase is:

> special gift (GNT)

#### 4:10b

**each of you should use whatever gift he has received to serve one another.**

* Each of you has received a gift from God. Use that gift to serve other people.
* God has given each of you the power/ability to do certain work. So you should all use this power/ability to help others.

**each of you should use whatever gift he has received to serve one another:** In this verse part Peter assumed that God had given some talent or ability to each believer. In some languages it may be natural to make this explicit. It may also be necessary to break 4:10b into two shorter sentences. For example:

> Each one of you has received a gift from God. You should use it to serve others.

**gift:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *gift* here refers to the ability that God gives to each person to do certain tasks. Another way to translate this word is:

> what God has given to each one

**to serve one another:** The phrase *to serve one another* refers to do things that help or benefit other people in some way. Here’s another way to translate this phrase:

> for the good of others (GNT)

##### **General Comment on 4:10a–b**

In some languages it may be natural to reorder some of the information in these verse parts. The grounds for the command could be put at the end. That is the order in Greek. For example:

> 10bEach of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, 10aas faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms. (NIV)

> 10bJust as each one has received a gift, use it to serve one another, 10aas good stewards of the varied grace of God. (NET)

In this section, Peter said that the end of the world is near, and therefore Christians should be self\-controlled and prayerful. They should love each other, be hospitable, and use their special abilities to help each other. In this way they would bring glory to God.

Some other headings for this section include:

> Use God’s Gifts Wisely (NCV)

#### 4:11a

**If anyone speaks, he should speak as one conveying the words of God.**

* The person who speaks about God, should say what God tells him to say.
* If you teach others, you should give/declare God’s message.

**If anyone speaks:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *If*, in this context, is better understood as “when.” Many English versions do not translate the conjunction. Some other ways to translate this word are:

> When someone speaks…

> anyone who speaks… (NCV)

**speaks:** The word *speaks* in this context refers to preaching or teaching about God. This is another way to translate this verb:

> preach (GNT)

**he should speak as one conveying the words of God:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *the very words of God* is literally “the oracles/utterances of God.” The BSB has supplied the words *he speak as one conveying*. Peter was saying that anyone who spoke about God should realize his responsibility and speak God’s word truthfully. Other ways to translate this include:

> Those who preach must preach God’s messages (GNT)

> Anyone who speaks should speak words from God (NCV)

> Whoever speaks must do so as one speaking the very words of God (NRSV)

**the words of God:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *the words of God* in this context means “messages from God.” Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> God’s message (CEV)

#### 4:11b

**If anyone serves, he should serve with the strength God provides,**

* The person who helps others should do it with the strength that God supplies.
* If you serve others, you should serve/work with the energy/power that God gives you.

**If anyone serves:** Again, Peter was not questioning whether this would happen. He meant “whenever anyone serves,” so it may be more natural to say:

> When someone serves…

**serves:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *serves* refers to any kind of service to other people. Some examples of this are caring for the sick, helping the orphans and widows, and welcoming strangers. See how you translated this word in 4:10a.

**he should serve with the strength God provides:** A person who wants to help others should serve with the strength God gives. This implies that he should work hard and enthusiastically. In some languages it may be necessary to translate the abstract noun *strength* as a verb phrase or an adjective:

> he should serve as God makes him strong/able

> he should work hard as God strengthens him

##### **General Comment on 4:11a–b**

Peter was using the third person to speak about the people he was writing to. In some languages it may be clearer to change the 3rd person “he” to the 2nd person plural “you” as in 4:2:

> If you speak, you should give God’s message. If you serve, you should do it with the strength God provides.

> Are you a speaker? Speak as one who utters God’s oracles. Do you give service? Give it in the strength which God supplies. (REB)

#### 4:11c

**so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ,**

* Do this so that all your behavior/actions will cause people to honour God because of Jesus Christ.
* Act like this in order that everything you do will bring God honour made possible by what Jesus Christ did.

**so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ:** This is a purpose clause. Believers should speak God’s message and serve in God’s strength in order that God might receive praise.

**God may be glorified:** In this context, the Greek word that the BSB translates as *glorified* means “honored.” People would thank and honor God for what his people had been doing to help others. This is a passive. If it is more natural to use an active verb you may say:

> God may receive praise/glory/ honor

> People may praise/glorify God

#### 4:11d

**to whom be the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.**

* To God are glory and power throughout eternity. This is true.
* Indeed, to God belong glory and authority through unending ages.

**to whom be the glory and the power forever and ever:** There are two ways of translating this doxology:

1. It is a statement. For example:

    > To him belong glory and dominion forever and ever. (RSV) *(GNT, CEV, ESV, NJB, NASB, NET, GW, NLT, REB, NCV, RSV)*

2. It is a wish. For example:

    > …to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. (KJV) *(BSB, NIV, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\).

**to whom:** There are two ways of understanding the pronoun *whom*:

1. It refers to God. For example:

    > \[so that in everything God may receive the glory, through Jesus Christ,] since to him alone belong all glory and power… (NJB) *(NJB; implied by REB, NET, NLT, NCV, RSV, NIV)*

2. It refers to Christ. For example:

    > Glory and power belong to Jesus Christ…! (GW) *(BSB, GNT, KJV, NASB, CEV, GW)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), since in the previous verse part Peter had been talking about glorifying God.

**Amen:** The word *Amen* means “let it be so.” Many languages transliterate this word. Some other ways to translate this word in English are:

> Truly!

> Indeed!

> So it shall be.

* **Associated Passages:** 1PE 4:11

## 1 Peter 4:12 (id: 474570)

### Section 4:12–19: Suffering for being a Christian

In this section, Peter reminds his readers that as Christians they should expect to suffer because Christ also suffered. He explained that it is a blessing to be insulted for following Christ. He also reminded them that a time of judgment was coming. Some other headings for this section include:

> Suffering as Christ suffered

> Your attitude when you suffer

#### 4:12a–b

Some of the Christians that Peter wrote this letter to were experiencing persecution from non\-Christians. Peter told believers not to be shocked or alarmed by this persecution, which was a test of their faith.

#### 4:12a

**Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial that has come upon you,**

* ¶ Dear friends, do not be dismayed at the testing fires you are going/living through.
* ¶ My dear ones, the great troubles you are experiencing should not astonish you. They are a crucible to test you.

**Beloved:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Beloved* was a common way for New Testament letter writers to address the Christian people they were writing to. It does not imply that Peter personally knew his readers. See how you translated this expression in 2:11a.

**do not be surprised at the fiery trial that has come upon you:** This is a passive form. In some languages, it may be natural to translate it with an active form. For example:

> do not let the fiery trial that has come upon you surprise you

**do not be surprised:** The word *surprised* here refers to the shock a person feels at unexpected bad news. Peter was saying that believers should expect to suffer. Here is another way to translate this:

> astonished (NET)

In some languages, it may be natural to translate this expression with an idiom. For example:

> taken aback (REB)

**the fiery trial that has come upon you:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *the painful trial* is literally “the burning/firing as a test.” Peter is here using the metaphor of refining precious metals that he had used in 1:6b and 1:7b–c. There are several ways to translate this metaphor:

* Keep the metaphor. For example:

    > the testing fire which is taking place among you (NJB)

    > a trial by fire is occurring among you (NET)

    > the fiery ordeal which is coming upon you to prove you (RSV)

* Translate the metaphor as a simile. For example:

    > you are going through testing that is like walking through fire (CEV)

* Translate the meaning. For example:

    > the painful test you are suffering (GNT)

#### 4:12b

**as though something strange were happening to you.**

* Do not feel/think that you are experiencing something strange/unusual.
* So do not see them as something extraordinary/unexpected.

Some translations start a new sentence here. For example:

> Do not think that something strange is happening to you. (NCV)

**as though something strange were happening to you:** The word *strange* here refers to something that is unusual in a bad way. Peter was saying that Christians should not think it was strange or unusual that they should suffer. Some other ways *strange* has been translated include:

> unusual (GNT)

> extraordinary (REB)

* **Associated Passages:** 1PE 4:12

### Section 4:12–19: Suffering for being a Christian

In this section, Peter reminds his readers that as Christians they should expect to suffer because Christ also suffered. He explained that it is a blessing to be insulted for following Christ. He also reminded them that a time of judgment was coming. Some other headings for this section include:

> Suffering as Christ suffered

> Your attitude when you suffer

#### 4:13a

**But rejoice that you share in the sufferings of Christ,**

* Instead, be happy to the extent that you are suffering as Christ suffered,
* Rather, you should be joyful insofar as you are taking part in the sufferings that Christ experienced.

**But:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *But* introduces a contrast. Peter’s readers were to rejoice instead of being unpleasantly surprised. Here is another way to translate this word:

> Rather (GNT)

**rejoice that you share in the sufferings of Christ:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *rejoice that you share in the sufferings of Christ* is literally “rejoice to the extent that you share in the sufferings of Christ.”

**rejoice:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *rejoice* is a strong word that can be translated as “leap/dance for joy.” See 1:6a, where the same word occurs and is translated as:

> greatly rejoice

**share in the sufferings of Christ:** Believers were to some extent suffering in the same way that Christ suffered. However, believers cannot completely suffer as Christ did. To the extent that believers do suffer as Christ did, they should be glad.

Some other ways this phrase has been translated include:

> rejoice in so far as you share in Christ’s suffering (RSV)

> be very glad—for these trials make you partners with Christ in his suffering (NLT)

> Be glad for the chance to suffer as Christ suffered. (CEV)

#### 4:13b

**so that you may be overjoyed at the revelation of His glory.**

* in order that, on the day when all people will see his glory, you will rejoice very much.
* Then you will be able to know even greater joy when he appears in his glory.

**so that you may be overjoyed:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *you may be overjoyed* is literally “you may rejoice, being glad.” This double verb intensifies the idea that the believers were to have great joy. Some other ways *overjoyed* has been translated are:

> full of joy (GW)

> wonderful joy (NLT)

**at the revelation of His glory:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *at the revelation of His glory* refers to the time when Christ will return to the earth and everyone will see his glory. The same word for “revelation” is used in 1:7e.

**glory:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *glory* refers to a shining brightness. This represented God’s holiness and majesty. Such *glory* often accompanied the appearance of God or his angels to people. Some other ways to translate *glory* are:

> greatness

> majesty

> Suffering as Christ suffered

> Your attitude when you suffer

#### 4:14

Christians are persecuted because their enemies see they are different, and they are different because the glorious Spirit of God is living within them.

#### 4:14a

**If you are insulted for the name of Christ,**

* If people say bad things about you because you are people of Christ,
* If you receive insults because you follow Christ,

**If you are insulted for the name of Christ:** This conditional phrase suggests something that was a real possibility. Peter knew that sometimes the non\-Christians would insult the Christians. It might not happen to everyone, but some Christians would receive insults.

**you are insulted:** This is a passive clause. If it is more natural in your language to use an active verb here, you may say:

> people insult you

**for the name of Christ:** The phrase *for the name of Christ* means “because you belong to Christ” or “because you confess Christ.” Some other ways this phrase has been translated are:

> for being a Christian (CEV)

> because you are Christ’s followers (GNT)

#### 4:14b

**you are blessed,**

* God is really/actually blessing you,
* you should count yourselves happy,
* how favoured/fortunate you are!

**you are blessed:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *blessed* here means “in a good situation” or “to be envied.” See how you translated this word in 3:14a.

##### **General Comment on 4:14a–b**

In some languages it may be natural to reverse the order of these verse parts. For example:

> 14bYou are blessed 14aif people insult you because of the name of Christ.

#### 4:14c

**because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you.**

* for the Spirit of glory, who is the Spirit of God, rests on you.
* You are fortunate because the glorious Spirit of God is with you.

**because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you:** Peter was referring to one Spirit, the Holy Spirit. To make this clear you may translate *the Spirit of glory and of God* as:

> the spirit of glory, which is the Spirit of God (NRSV)

> the glorious Spirit, the Spirit of God (GNT)

> the glorious Spirit of God

**Spirit of glory:** The word *glory* refers to God’s majesty, which in the Bible is often represented by a shining brightness or light. Some other ways to translate this phrase are:

> wonderful Spirit

> Spirit that is great

### Section 4:12–19: Suffering for being a Christian

In this section, Peter reminds his readers that as Christians they should expect to suffer because Christ also suffered. He explained that it is a blessing to be insulted for following Christ. He also reminded them that a time of judgment was coming. Some other headings for this section include:

> Suffering as Christ suffered

> Your attitude when you suffer

#### 4:15–16

What Peter says in these verses is similar to what he said in 2:20\.

#### 4:15a

**Indeed, none of you should suffer**

* Perhaps you will receive pain/punishment,
* If they punish you,

#### 4:15b

**as a murderer or thief or wrongdoer, or even as a meddler.**

* but it should not be because you have committed murder or theft or any other crime, or even been a nuisance.
* saying you have killed someone, or stolen something, or done a bad thing, or entered into other people’s affairs, it must not be true that you did such a thing.

#### 4:15a–b

**meddler:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *meddler* occurs only here in the New Testament.The meaning of *ἀλλοτριεπίσκοπος* is difficult to establish with certainty since it appears nowhere else in biblical or nonbiblical Greek except for three late instances in the fourth and fifth centuries C. E. The majority rendering is “busybody” or “meddler” (KJV, ESV, NIV, GNT; see also Louw \& Nida, 88\.245\), which has several points in its favor (see Michaels page 267–268\). \[Mark Dubis, *1 Peter: A Handbook on the Greek Text, Baylor Handbook on the Greek New Testament* (Waco, TX: Baylor University Press, 2010\), page152]. Therefore commentators do not entirely agree about its meaning. It appears to have the general meaning of “someone who causes trouble” or “someone who causes trouble by interfering in other people’s business.” Other ways to translate this word include:

> mischief\-maker (RSV)

> troublemaker (NET)

> Suffering as Christ suffered

> Your attitude when you suffer

#### 4:16a–b

If a believer suffers because of his faith, he should not be ashamed but make sure that his behavior as a follower of Christ brings honor to God.

#### 4:16a

**But if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed,**

* But if you receive pain/punishment because you are a Christian, do not feel shame.
* But if they punish you because you are a follower/disciple of Christ, you should not be ashamed.

**But:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *But* introduces a contrast between suffering for doing something bad in 4:15 and suffering for being a Christian. Introduce this contrast in a way that is natural for your language.

**if you suffer as a Christian:** The phrase *if you suffer as a Christian* means “if you are punished for being a Christian” or “if you have to endure suffering because you are a Christian.”

**as a Christian:** People started called the believers *Christians* because they were followers of Christ (see Acts 11:26\).

**do not be ashamed:** In some languages it may be natural to say of what the believers should not be *ashamed*. For example:

> do not be ashamed of it/that

> do not feel disgrace that you received such punishment

#### 4:16b

**but glorify God that you bear that name.**

* Instead, praise God that you are called a Christian.
* But rather, give God praise/glory that people call you a follower of Christ.

**but:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *but* introduces what the believers should do instead of feeling ashamed. Another way to translate this is:

> instead

**glorify God that you bear that name:** The Greek clause that the BSB translates as *glorify God that you bear that name* is literally “glorify God by this name.”

**glorify:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *glorify*, that is, “give honor to,” means to bring God glory by the way you live, as in John 21:19 and 1 Corinthians. 6:20\.

**bear that name:** the phrase *bear that name* refers to being called a “Christian” in 4:16a.

Some other ways to translate this clause are:

> Praise God for the privilege of being called by his name! (NLT)

> thank God that you bear Christ’s name. (GNT)

> Praise God that you belong to him. (CEV)

A literal translation may give the wrong meaning that the believers were calling themselves “Christ.” They were called “Christ\-followers” or “Christians” by others. When this term was initially used, it was said as an insult. So you may need to translate this as:

> praise God that they/people call you “Christians”

**For it is time for judgment to begin with the family of God;**

* ¶ For now God is beginning to judge people, starting with his own household.
* ¶ The time that God will judge people has arrived, and he will judge his own people first.

Peter considered the persecution of the Christians to be the beginning of the final judgment. The purpose of the judgment is to purify God’s people. The fact that God judges and disciplines his own people is also taught in the Old Testament. See Malachi chapter 3, Ezekiel chapter 9, and Jeremiah 25:29\.

**For:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *For* introduces a reason why Christians should praise God if they suffer for being a Christian (4:16b). That reason is stated in 4:17a: The time of judgment will soon begin with the family of God. Translate this conjunction in a way that is natural for your language.

**it is time for judgment to begin:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *time* in this context means the “right season.” In Peter’s time, God’s chosen time for judging people had begun.

**for judgment to begin:** In some languages it may be necessary to translate *judgment* as a verb. If you then need to supply a subject, you should supply “God.” For example:

> for God to begin judging people

> God will soon begin to judge people

**with the family of God:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *the family of God* is literally “the house of God.” Peter was saying that God would start by judging Christians. After that he would judge others. In some languages it may be natural to translate it as:

> God’s chosen people

> his own people (CEV)

> those who follow God/him

#### 4:17b

**and if it begins with us,**

* Since he is beginning by judging us,
* If he judges us(incl) his people first,

**and if it begins with us:** The conjunction *if* does not express possibility or doubt in this context. Peter was saying that the judgment was in fact beginning with Christians. So it may be necessary to translate this as:

> and since it is beginning with us…

#### 4:17c

**what will the outcome be for those who disobey the gospel of God?**

* what will it be like when he judges those who disobey the gospel he gave?
* God will judge the people who refuse his Good News much more severely.

**what will the outcome be for those who disobey the gospel of God?:** This is a rhetorical question. Peter was saying that the judgment of nonbelievers will be much more severe than the judgment of believers.

There are at least two ways to translate this rhetorical question:

* As a rhetorical question. For example:

    > …what will be the end of those who do not obey the gospel of God? (RSV)

    > …what will happen to those people who do not obey the Good News of God? (NCV)

* As an emphatic statement. For example:

    > Those people who do not obey the gospel of God will come to a bad end.

    > …imagine how terrible it will be for those who refuse to obey his message. (CEV)

Use whichever form is most natural for a strong statement in your language.

**gospel of God:** The phrase *gospel of God* refers to the “good news” of God, that is, God’s good news about Jesus Christ. See how you translated “Gospel” in 1:12c.

* **Associated Passages:** 1PE 4:17

## 1 Peter 4:18 (id: 474576)

### Section 4:12–19: Suffering for being a Christian

In this section, Peter reminds his readers that as Christians they should expect to suffer because Christ also suffered. He explained that it is a blessing to be insulted for following Christ. He also reminded them that a time of judgment was coming. Some other headings for this section include:

> Suffering as Christ suffered

> Your attitude when you suffer

#### 4:18a

**And,**

* As it is written in the Book of God,
* And as God has said in his holy book,

**And:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *And* introduces another rhetorical question. This second question is a quotation from Proverbs 11:31\. Translate this conjunction in a way that is natural for introducing another rhetorical question in your language.

#### 4:18b

**“If it is hard for the righteous to be saved,**

* “Since it is so difficult for good/just people to receive salvation,
* “Since God’s people will barely/scarcely escape/survive God’s wrath/judgement,

**If it is hard for the righteous to be saved:** Here again the *If* means “since” or “in view of the fact that.”

**it is hard:** Peter meant that even righteous people must experience suffering before they receive their final salvation. It is not easy or without cost and pain. This does not mean that it is difficult for God to save the righteous.

Other translation models are:

> There will be difficulties for the righteous before they are saved. So…

> Good people will meet/experience difficulties/troubles as God is saving them. Therefore…

**the righteous:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *the righteous* is also found in 3:12a. Here it refers to people who do what is right in God’s sight by obeying the gospel. Some other ways *righteous* can be translated include:

> the person who has God’s approval (GW)

> good people (CEV)

**be saved:** This is a passive verb. If you need to translate it as an active verb, you may be able to say:

> receive/attain salvation

> for God to save them

Again, Peter did not mean that it is hard for God to save people. If you supply “God” as the subject, you will need to make sure that you do not imply this.

#### 4:18c

**what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?”**

* will it not be impossible for ungodly and sinful people?”
* it will be terrible for people who reject him and do bad things.”

**what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?:** This is a rhetorical question. Peter was implying that something very bad was going to happen to the ungodly and the sinner. There are two ways to translate this:

* as a rhetorical question. For example:

    > …what will become of the ungodly and sinners? (NET)

    > …what will happen to sinners and to others who don’t respect God? (CEV)

* as a statement. For example:

    > …the wicked person and the sinner will surely be lost! (NCV)

**the ungodly and the sinner:** The phrase *the ungodly and the sinner* describes one group of people, not two individuals, so the GNT translates it as:

> godless sinners

* **Associated Passages:** 1PE 4:18

## 1 Peter 4:19 (id: 474577)

### Section 4:12–19: Suffering for being a Christian

In this section, Peter reminds his readers that as Christians they should expect to suffer because Christ also suffered. He explained that it is a blessing to be insulted for following Christ. He also reminded them that a time of judgment was coming. Some other headings for this section include:

> Suffering as Christ suffered

> Your attitude when you suffer

#### 4:19a

**So then, those who suffer according to God’s will**

* Therefore, people who suffer because God wishes it
* And so, if God is permitting you to suffer,

**So then:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *So then* introduces a conclusion to what Peter had just been saying. In view of 4:12–18, this is what suffering believers should do. Here is another way to translation this transition:

> Therefore (RSV)

**those who suffer according to God’s will:** There are two ways of understanding the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *those who suffer according to God’s will*:

1. It refers to people who suffer because it is God’s will; that is, because God permits it. For example:

    > because that is God’s will for them (GNT) *(GW, NJB, GNT)*

2. It refers to people who suffer in the way God wants; that is, for obeying God. For example:

    > If you suffer for obeying God… (CEV) *(NCV, CEV)*

Many other English versions are ambiguous (BSB, NIV, NASB, RSV, NLT, REB, NET). It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). This interpretation follows Peter’s general theme in this letter of God requiring believers to suffer.

#### 4:19b

**should entrust their souls to their faithful Creator**

* should put themselves into the hands of God who created them and who will keep his word.
* you should entrust yourself to him, for he is your Maker. You can depend on him.

**should entrust their souls to their faithful Creator:** In some languages it may be natural to translate this as two separate clauses:

> should commit themselves to their Creator, for he is faithful

> entrust their souls to him…their Maker will not fail them (REB)

**should entrust their souls:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *entrust their souls* uses the Greek word for “soul” to refer to a person’s whole being or whole life, including both their body and their spirit.

**their…Creator:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *their…Creator* is literally “a Creator.” In this context Peter was thinking particularly of the fact that God had created the people who were suffering. So the BSB has supplied the word *their*, and this may be natural in other languages also. Some other ways to translate this are:

> their Maker (REB)

> the God who created you (NLT)

**faithful:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *faithful* means “reliable, trustworthy.” God keeps his word, and he will not forsake anyone who believes in him. The GNT has:

> who always keeps his promise

#### 4:19c

**and continue to do good.**

* They should also continue to do good.
* You should also keep on acting in a way that is right.

**and continue to do good:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *and continue to do good* is literally “in good action.” The verb related to this is also used in 2:15, 2:20 and 3:6\. For reasons of English style, many English versions translate it here as a command (NIV, REB, CEV, RSV, GW). Other ways to translate it include:

> as they do good (NET)

> as they continue to do what is right (NCV)

##### **General Comment on 4:18–19**

Peter used the third person to speak about those who were suffering (“those who suffer”). But he was referring to those of his readers who were suffering. So in some languages it may be natural to use the second person “you(plur)”:

> So those among you who are suffering in accordance with God’s will should entrust yourselves to your faithful Creator and continue to do good.

* **Associated Passages:** 1PE 4:19

## 1 Peter 5:1 (id: 474578)

### Section 5:1–11: Instructions for God’s people

In this section Peter addressed the church community and gave them words of encouragement. First, he addressed the leaders and commanded them to be faithful in looking after the believers. He then addressed younger men in the church, and finally the whole community. He concluded this section by reminding them of God’s faithfulness.

Some other headings for this section include:

> Leading and Living in God’s Flock (NET)

> Advice for Elders and Young Men (NLT)

#### 5:1a–b

In these verse parts Peter wrote about himself and explained the basis on which he was appealing to the church leaders.

#### 5:1a

**As a fellow elder, a witness of Christ’s sufferings,**

* ¶ I am an elder and a witness of how Christ suffered,
* ¶ I am a leader like some of you. I saw/witnessed the way Christ suffered.

There is a textual problem here. Some Greek texts have an introductory word meaning “therefore,” and some do not:

1. There is an introductory or connecting word. For example:

    > So… (RSV) *(NASB, REB, NET, NLT, NCV, RSV)*

2. There is no introductory or connecting word. *(BSB, KJV, NIV, GW, CEV, GNT, NJB)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\), with the majority of Greek manuscripts. Some other logical connectors in English are:

> So

> Now (NCV)

**As a fellow elder:** Peter based his appeal to the elders on who he was. He was an elder, a church leader, as they were.

**a witness of Christ’s sufferings:** There are several ways of understanding the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *a witness of Christ’s sufferings*:

1. It means that Peter was an eyewitness to how Jesus suffered.See Selwyn page 229\. (This does not necessarily mean that Peter was claiming to have been present at the crucifixion.) For example:

    > I have seen Christ’s suffering (NCV) *(GW, NCV)*

2. It means that Peter was one who gave a verbal testimony to how Christ suffered. He gave witness or told about this.See Achtemeier page 323; Best page 168; Michaels page 281, Davids.
3. It means that Peter shared in the sufferings of Christ.See Achtemeier page 324; Marshall page 161; Kelly page 198–199\.

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), understanding that Peter is speaking of himself in a general sense as a witness of Christ’s suffering throughout his ministry.

#### 5:1b

**and a partaker of the glory to be revealed,**

* and I will also have a part in the glory which is going to be displayed.
* I will also join with him in the glory/brilliance that God will show to us(incl).

**and:** The word *and* here introduces another thing that was true about Peter. Connect 5:1b and 5:1c together in a way that is natural in your language.

**a partaker of the glory to be revealed:** Peter was continuing to describe himself. He looked forward to having a part in the glory that would be seen when Jesus returned to this earth. In some languages it may be natural to make it clear by using the first\-person pronoun “I,” as the CEV has done:

> and I will share in his glory when it is shown to us (CEV)

**the glory:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *glory* refers to the bright light that reflects and symbolizes the greatness of God and Christ. See how you translated *glory* in 4:11 and 4:13\.

**to be revealed:** This is a passive verb. To “reveal” means to make known something that is hidden or secret. If it is more natural in your language to use an active verb, you could say:

> that God will reveal/show/display

If it is necessary for you to say to whom God would reveal this glory, you could supply the phrase “to us”:

> that God will reveal to us(incl)

#### 5:1c

**I appeal to the elders among you:**

* So to you who are also elders, I write this appeal.
* Now I write some challenging/urgent words to those people who are the leaders of your churches.

**I appeal:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *appeal* means to urge or warmly invite/encourage someone to do something. Some other ways to translate *appeal* include:

> exhort (RSV)

> I am writing to encourage you (CEV)

**to the elders among you:** The phrase *to the elders among you* introduces some advice that Peter wanted to give to one group among his readers, the elders.

**elders:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *elders* here refers to the church leaders. These leaders would usually be chosen from among the older church members. Some other ways to translate this include using a general description. For example:

> spiritual leaders

> persons caring for the Christians

##### **General Comment on 5:1**

In Greek, Peter first appeals to the elders and then gives this description of himself as the basis of his appeal. The NIV is one of many translations that reflects the Greek word order here:

To the elders among you, I appeal as a fellow elder and a witness of Christ’s sufferings who also will share in the glory to be revealed

* **Associated Passages:** 1PE 5:1

## 1 Peter 5:2 (id: 474579)

### Section 5:1–11: Instructions for God’s people

In this section Peter addressed the church community and gave them words of encouragement. First, he addressed the leaders and commanded them to be faithful in looking after the believers. He then addressed younger men in the church, and finally the whole community. He concluded this section by reminding them of God’s faithfulness.

Some other headings for this section include:

> Leading and Living in God’s Flock (NET)

> Advice for Elders and Young Men (NLT)

#### 5:2a

**Be shepherds of God’s flock that is among you,**

* Be like good shepherds and watch over God’s people whom he has entrusted to you.
* I appeal to you leaders, take care of the people of God. You are responsible for them as a shepherd is responsible to care for his sheep.

This is the beginning of Peter’s appeal to the elders. In some languages it may be necessary to introduce it with a phrase such as:

> This is my appeal…

**Be shepherds of God’s flock:** This is a metaphor. In the lands of the Bible, *shepherds* cared for and protected sheep. Church leaders were to care for the members of the church as a shepherd took care of his sheep.

In some languages, a literal translation of this metaphor may be difficult to understand. Some other ways to translate it are:

* Change the metaphor to a simile. For example:

    > Just as shepherds watch over their sheep, you must watch over everyone God has placed in your care (CEV)

* Change the metaphor to a simile and make explicit the way that they are similar. For example:

    > Care for God’s people as a shepherd watches over his flock of sheep

* Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:

    > Watch over God’s people who are under your care

**God’s flock:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *God’s flock* means “the flock that belongs to God.” God is the owner of the flock. A *flock* is a group of sheep. This is a metaphor for a church or congregation. In some languages it may be more natural and understandable to make the meaning clear. For example:

> flock of sheep

> God’s people

**that is among you:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *that is among you* in this context means “that is your responsibility.” God had given each spiritual leader the responsibility of taking care of other Christians. Other ways to translate this include:

> entrusted to you (NLT)

> for whom you are responsible (NCV)

> that is under your care (NIV)

Try to translate using an expression that can be used both of a shepherd looking after his sheep and of a spiritual leader looking after Christians.

#### 5:2b

**watching over them not out of compulsion,**

* Do not watch over them because people compel you to work.
* It is not out of duty/obligation that you should care for them,

**watching over them not out of compulsion:** In some languages it may be natural to translate this as one simple command. Be careful, however, to make it clear that Peter was not forbidding people to serve as overseers. He was forbidding them to serve with the wrong motives. For example:

> do not serve as overseers because you are forced/obliged to

**watching over them:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *watching over* is another term describing the work of church leaders and is similar in meaning to “shepherd.”

There is a textual problem here:

1. Some Greek manuscripts contain the word translated as *watching over*. For example:

    > exercising oversight (NASB) *(BSB, KJV, NIV, NRSV, NET, NLT, NCV, NASB)*

2. Some Greek manuscripts do not contain the word translated as *watching over*. For example:

    > do it… (REB) *(RSV, CEV, NJB, GW, REB)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\), since the majority of modern versions include this word.It is present in the UBS Greek text in square brackets with a C rating, indicating considerable uncertainty. Some commentators think that the word was omitted in some ancient manuscripts because it seemed to confuse the later church distinctions between elders and bishops.

**not out of compulsion:** In Peter’s day, church members sometimes chose their own overseers and sometimes the apostles appointed them. People did not just volunteer to be overseers. So Peter was telling the people who were chosen not to serve out of a sense of obligation, as if they had no choice. Some other ways to translate this phrase include, negatively and positively:

> Don’t do this because you have to (GW)

> do it voluntarily (CEB)

#### 5:2c

**but because it is God’s will;**

* Instead, care for them because you freely choose to, as God desires.
* but because you are happy to do it. That is what pleases God.

**but:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *but* introduces a contrast to the words “not because you must” in the previous verse part. Express this contrast in a way that is natural in your language. For example:

> Instead (NIRV)

**because it is God’s will:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *because it is God’s will* is literally “willingly according to God.” Peter is telling the elders to serve willingly because this is what God wants them to do. For example:

> Watch over it willingly…because you are eager to serve God (NLT)

Other ways of translating these words include:

> Do it willingly in order to please God (CEV)

> because you are willing, as God wants you to be (NIV)

**it is God’s will:** There is a textual problem with the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *it is God’s will*, which is literally “willingly according to God”:

1. Some Greek texts have the words “according to God.” For example:

    > willingly, as God would have you (ESV) *(BSB, NIV, NET, GNT, NRSV, NJB, NCV, CEV, REB, NASB)*

2. Some Greek texts do not have the words “according to God.” *(RSV, KJV, GW, NLT)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\), with the majority of English versions.The words *κατ θεόν*, “according to God,” do not occur in some manuscripts. They are included in the UBS Greek NT with a {C} rating, indicating difficulty in deciding whether to place them in the text.

Other ways of translating these words include:

> because you are willing, as God wants you to be (NIV)

> because you want…. That is how God wants it (NCV)

##### **General Comment on 5:2b–c**

In some languages it may be more natural to reverse the order of these verse parts and put the positive command first. For example:

> 2cDo it willingly in order to please God, 2band not simply because you think you must. (CEV)

#### 5:2d

**not out of greed, but out of eagerness;**

* Do not work just because you want to get money, but work with all your heart.
* Serve as an elder eagerly/willingly, and not for the sake of making money.

**out of greed:** The word that the BSB translates with the phrase *out of greed* is an adverb that combines the words for “shame” and “gain.” It describes a motivation that is shameful: wanting to make as much money as possible. Peter was not forbidding church leaders to receive wages. He was saying that they should not become leaders for the sake of the money they could receive. Some other ways to translate this phrase are:

> not for what you will get out of it (NLT)

> not for shameful gain (ESV)

**out of eagerness:** The Greek word that the BSB has translated with the phrase *out of eagerness* is literally “eagerly.” If your language would not naturally use an abstract noun such as *eagerness*, you could translate this as “eagerly,” as several English versions do (ESV, NET, NKJV, NRSV). It may also be helpful in your language to say what Peter wants the elders to do *out of eagerness*. Some other ways to translate this phrase are:

> eager to serve (NIV)

> happy to serve (NCV)

##### **General Comment on 5:2d**

In some languages it may be natural to translate this with the positive idea first:

> be eager to serve, and not greedy for money

> Let it be something you want to do, instead of something you do merely to make money (CEV)

### Section 5:1–11: Instructions for God’s people

In this section Peter addressed the church community and gave them words of encouragement. First, he addressed the leaders and commanded them to be faithful in looking after the believers. He then addressed younger men in the church, and finally the whole community. He concluded this section by reminding them of God’s faithfulness.

Some other headings for this section include:

#### 5:3a

**not lording it over those entrusted to you,**

* Do not rule the people God has put into your hands as if you were chiefs and they were your slaves.
* Do not lead your group/band by acting like a dictator/boss.

**not lording it over:** The Greek verb that the BSB translates as *lording it over* means to rule people in a bossy or dictatorial way. Church leaders should not behave like kings or chiefs who rule their people in a domineering way. The way church leaders behave should show believers how they themselves should behave. See Matthew 20:25 and Mark 10:42, where the same verb is used. Some other ways to translate this verb are:

> Don’t be bossy (CEV)

> Do not be like a ruler (NCV)

> not domineering (ESV)

**those entrusted to you:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *those entrusted to you* refers to the groups of believers who were assigned to the various church leaders. Other ways of translating this include:

> those in your charge (RSV)

> people you are responsible for (NCV)

> those whom God has entrusted to you

#### 5:3b

**but being examples to the flock.**

* Instead let your good behavior show the way that the people should behave.
* Instead behave well so that it will be fitting that the people behave as you do.

**but:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *but* introduces a contrast. The elders were not to lead by giving orders *but* by setting a good example. Translate this contrast in a way that is natural in your language.

**being examples to the flock:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *being examples to the flock* means that the church leaders were to behave in a way that others could imitate. In some languages it may be helpful to supply a word meaning “good.” For example:

> setting good examples for the flock.

**the flock:** The phrase *the flock* refers back to the metaphor in 5:2a. Each elder was like a shepherd and the believers under his care were like his flock of sheep. So *the flock* is referring to the same people as “those entrusted to you” in 5:3a. You may want to translate *flock* the same way you did in 5:2a.

* **Associated Passages:** 1PE 5:3

### Section 5:1–11: Instructions for God’s people

In this section Peter addressed the church community and gave them words of encouragement. First, he addressed the leaders and commanded them to be faithful in looking after the believers. He then addressed younger men in the church, and finally the whole community. He concluded this section by reminding them of God’s faithfulness.

Some other headings for this section include:

#### 5:4a

**And when the Chief Shepherd appears,**

* And then, when the head/leading shepherd comes/returns,
* If you do this, Jesus Christ, the chief over all the leaders/shepherds, at the time he appears

**the Chief Shepherd:** The phrase *the Chief Shepherd* is a metaphor for Jesus Christ. He is above all church leaders. In some languages it may not be clear that this expression refers to Christ. If that is true for your language, you should make this explicit. For example:

> when Christ the Chief Shepherd (CEV)

**appears:** The verb *appears* here refers to the time when Jesus will return to earth for everyone to see. Some other ways to translate this verb are:

> comes (NCV)

> returns (CEV)

#### 5:4b

**you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away.**

* you will receive as a reward a crown/garland of glory that will never spoil/wither.
* will reward you with unfading/undying glory/honour.

**you will receive:** It is implied that the Chief Shepherd is the one who will give this crown. Here is another way to translate this:

> our master, Christ, will give you (EASY)

**crown of glory:** There are two ways of understanding the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *crown of glory*:

1. It means a crown that will consist of glory.See Davids; Best page 171; Marshall page 164; Kelly page 204; Selwyn page 233\. For example:

    > glory, a crown that never fades (REB) *(NLT, REB)*

2. It means a glorious crown. For example:

    > a glorious crown (NCV) *(CEV, NCV, GNT)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). The reward or crown that believers will receive will be glory. This is the natural meaning in the context, since in 5:1 Peter had mentioned sharing Christ’s glory. This is also the view of many commentators.

**crown:** The Greeks used to put a circle or garland of leaves on the head of the winner of a race as a sign that he was the victor. This was called the *crown*. Citizens who served their city well also received such a *crown*. It was a reward for having served well. Here Peter is using *crown* as a metaphor for the reward that God will give to his people.

**glory:** In this context, the Greek word that the BSB translates as *glory* means “honor.” See how you translated *glory* in 4:14c and 5:1c.

**never fade away:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *fade away* describes the way in which flowers and leaves wither and die. Peter was contrasting a crown or garland of leaves to a “crown of glory.” Although a garland of leaves soon withers, the reward given to faithful church leaders will never spoil. It will last forever. See how you translated *fade* in 1:4\. Some other ways to translate this word include:

> never lose its brightness (GNT)

> never lose its beauty (NCV)

> of never\-ending glory (NLT)

* **Associated Passages:** 1PE 5:4

He then addressed younger men in the church, and finally the whole community. He concluded this section by reminding them of God’s faithfulness.

Some other headings for this section include:

### Paragraph 5:5

In this paragraph Peter urged his readers to be humble in their attitude and in their behavior to one another.

#### 5:5a

**Young men, in the same way, submit yourselves to your elders.**

* ¶ Similarly, you young men should submit to the authority of the church leaders.
* ¶ As for you, young people, I tell you, obey your spiritual leaders.

**Young men:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Young men* refers in a general way to men under the age of about forty. It is a masculine form but can refer to people of both sexes. Peter was not excluding young women, so some versions translate this as:

> younger people (NJB)

> you that are younger (RSV)

**in the same way:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *in the same way* appears to be a way of introducing a new subject on the same general theme. This same expression was used in 3:1, addressed to wives. As the elders submit to the Chief Shepherd, so the young men should submit to their elders. As it is a new subject, the most natural way to start the paragraph may be:

> As for you, young men/men and women…

**submit yourselves to:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *submit yourselves to* means to accept the authority of someone. This is the same word that was used in 2:13a. Some other ways this word has been translated include:

> accept the authority of (NLT)

> obey (CEV)

**your elders:** There are two ways of interpreting the Greek word that the BSB translates as *elders* here:

1. It refers to church leaders. For example:

    > the elders (NJB) *(RSV, NJB, NET, GW, NLT)*

2. It refers to older people in general. For example:

    > older people (NCV) *(BSB, KJV, NASB, REB, CEV, NIV, GNT, NCV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). Peter was probably using the word “elder” in the same sense in which he used it in 5:1–4\.

#### 5:5b

**And all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another,**

* You should all put on a humble attitude towards one another.
* I also tell you all, be gentle in all your dealings with each other,

**all of you:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *all of you* here means the whole church, including the elders. Here is another way to translate this:

> everyone (CEV)

**clothe yourselves with humility:** This is a metaphor. Peter was comparing *humility* to an item of clothing that a person wraps around himself. Other ways to translate this include:

> wrap yourselves in humility

> cover/cloak yourself with humility

> wear a humble attitude

Avoid giving the impression that Peter was referring to hiding oneself. He wanted this virtue to be an important part of every believer’s way of thinking.

If it is hard to translate this metaphor in your language, you may need to say something more general:

> always behave in a modest/humble way

> Everyone should be humble toward everybody else. (CEV)

**humility:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *humility* refers to having a modest and appropriate attitude towards oneself. It means not being proud or arrogant. In some languages, *humility* may need to be expressed in a verb form. For example:

> be humble

#### 5:5c

**because,**

* For it is as they wrote in the Book of God,
* since the holy Scripture says,

**because:** The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *because* here introduces a quotation from the Scriptures that supports what Peter had just been saying.

You may wish to make clear that the quotation is from Scripture (Proverbs 3:34\) and say:

> as they wrote in God’s word/book

#### 5:5d

**“God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”**

* “God rejects proud people, but he shows favour to people who are humble.”
* “God resists arrogant people, but he is kind to humble/modest/lowly people.”

**God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble:** This is a proverb or a saying similar in form to a proverb. Other ways to translate it include:

> God opposes the arrogant but favors the humble (GW)

> God opposes proud people, but he helps everyone who is humble (CEV)

**God opposes the proud:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *God opposes the proud* means that God rejects, resists, or refuses to help people who are proud. Some other ways this phrase is translated include:

> God is against the proud (NCV)

> God resists the proud (GNT)

**the proud:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *the proud* refers to people who are arrogant or haughty, who are not humble. These are people who think highly of themselves and despise others. They may think that they do not need God’s grace. Here are some other ways to translate this noun:

> the arrogant (GW)

> proud people

**but gives grace to the humble:** This phrase describes the opposite situation. God does not oppose or refuse to help humble people. On the contrary, he is kind to them. See how you translated the related word “humility” in 5:5b.

**grace:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *grace* here refers to kindness or favor that is undeserved. See how you translated this word in 1:2e and 1:10a.

**the humble:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *the humble* is the opposite of “the proud.” It refers to people who are modest and think of themselves in a humble and appropriate way. They realize that they are undeserving of God’s kindness. See how you translated the related word “humility” in 5:5b. Here is another way to translate this noun:

> proud people

### Section 5:1–11: Instructions for God’s people

In this section Peter addressed the church community and gave them words of encouragement. First, he addressed the leaders and commanded them to be faithful in looking after the believers. He then addressed younger men in the church, and finally the whole community. He concluded this section by reminding them of God’s faithfulness.

Some other headings for this section include:

> Leading and Living in God’s Flock (NET)

> Advice for Elders and Young Men (NLT)

### Paragraph 5:6–7

In this paragraph Peter’s focus changes away from relationships with other believers to the believer’s relationship with God. He began to introduce this theme with the quotation from Proverbs 3:34 in the last part of the previous verse.

#### 5:6a

**Humble yourselves, therefore, under God’s mighty hand,**

* ¶ Humble yourselves before God, who has great power,
* ¶ So then, bow meekly/humbly before our powerful God,

**Humble yourselves:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Humble yourselves* means to make yourself low or bow down. In this context it refers to accepting suffering from God without complaining. Some other ways to translate this expression are:

> submit

> make yourself low

**therefore:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *therefore* connects Peter’s command here to the Scripture he has just quoted. Because of what the Scriptures say, this is what Peter’s readers are to do. Translate this connection in a way that is natural in your language.

**under God’s mighty hand:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates literally as *God’s mighty hand* is a figure of speech that refers to God’s great power. In this context it refers to God permitting his people to suffer persecution. Peter urged his readers to humbly accept such suffering as God’s will for them.

In some languages it may be necessary to remove the *hand* metaphor. The CEV provides a model for this:

> in the presence of God’s mighty power (CEV)

#### 5:6b

**so that in due time He may exalt you.**

* so that he will honour you at the appropriate/proper time.
* so that he may exalt you when the time is right/come.

**so that in due time He may exalt you:** This is a purpose clause. Believers submit themselves to God and suffer patiently because they know that if they do, he will exalt them.

**in due time:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *in due time* means at the right time, the time that God has decided, the time he wishes. Most commentators agree that this refers to the return of Christ at the end of the age. Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> when the right time comes (NCV)

**He may exalt you:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *exalt you* means “set you on high.” God will figuratively raise the believers up. In this context, this means that he will free them from their sufferings and give them honor. Here is another way to translate this:

> he will honor you (CEV)

* **Associated Passages:** 1PE 5:6

## 1 Peter 5:7 (id: 474584)

### Section 5:1–11: Instructions for God’s people

In this section Peter addressed the church community and gave them words of encouragement. First, he addressed the leaders and commanded them to be faithful in looking after the believers. He then addressed younger men in the church, and finally the whole community. He concluded this section by reminding them of God’s faithfulness.

Some other headings for this section include:

> Leading and Living in God’s Flock (NET)

> Advice for Elders and Young Men (NLT)

### Paragraph 5:6–7

In this paragraph Peter’s focus changes away from relationships with other believers to the believer’s relationship with God. He began to introduce this theme with the quotation from Proverbs 3:34 in the last part of the previous verse.

#### 5:7a

**Cast all your anxiety on Him,**

* Throw/put all the things which trouble you into God’s hands,
* Tell God about all your needs and stop worrying about them,

**Cast all your anxiety on Him:** The Greek clause that the BSB translates as *Cast all your anxiety on Him* is literally “casting all your anxiety on him,” continuing the sentence from the previous verse. The BSB has chosen to begin a new sentence here, as do many other English translations.

This Greek clause connects with the previous verse and suggests that one way in which we humble ourselves before God (5:6\) is by casting all our anxiety onto him. The word *anxiety* means “fear, worry.” Peter wanted his readers to tell God about their concerns and trust him to take care of them. He used a figure of speech to express this idea, as if he wanted his readers literally to *Cast* or throw their worries onto God. Other ways of translating this clause include:

> give all your worries to him (NCV)

> Leave all your worries with him (GNT)

> If you have any kind of trouble in your mind, give it to God (EASY)

#### 5:7b

**because He cares for you.**

* because he is concerned about you.
* for he wants to take care of you.

**because He cares for you:** This verse part gives the reason why believers can freely cast their anxiety upon God. The reason is that God loves them and is concerned about their well\-being. Some other ways to translate this clause are:

> he provides what you need

> he is watching over you

##### **General Comment on 5:7a–b**

In some languages it may be natural to reverse the order of these verse parts and to give first the reason for the command:

> 7bGod cares for you, so 7aturn all your worries over to him (CEV)

> 7bHe cares for you, so 7acast all your anxiety on him (REB)

## 1 Peter 5:8 (id: 474585)

### Section 5:1–11: Instructions for God’s people

In this section Peter addressed the church community and gave them words of encouragement. First, he addressed the leaders and commanded them to be faithful in looking after the believers. He then addressed younger men in the church, and finally the whole community. He concluded this section by reminding them of God’s faithfulness.

Some other headings for this section include:

> Leading and Living in God’s Flock (NET)

> Advice for Elders and Young Men (NLT)

### Paragraph 5:8–11

Peter reminded his readers that Satan was their enemy and they needed to remain alert and steadfast. God would remain faithful to them and would bring them through their suffering to heaven.

#### 5:8a

**Be sober\-minded and alert.**

* ¶ Think clearly, and keep awake.
* ¶ Keep your wits about you and your eyes wide open!

**Be sober\-minded and alert:** The Greek expression that the BSB translates as *Be sober\-minded and alert* consists of two separate commands: “Be sober\-minded, be alert.” Consider if it is natural to keep them separate or combine them in some way. Here is another way to translate them separately:

> Be alert and of sober mind (NIV)

**Be sober\-minded:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Be sober\-minded* is a command to keep sober or think clearly. See how you translated this word in 1:13b and 4:7b. It can also be translated as:

> Keep your mind clear (GW)

> Be on your guard (CEV)

**Be…alert:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Be…alert* is a command to keep awake. This is a figure of speech. Peter wanted his readers to be awake spiritually, ready for anything that might happen. He wanted them to remain aware that Satan might attack them. Other English versions say:

> watch out (NLT)

> stay awake (CEV)

#### 5:8b–c

**Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour:** The BSB in these verse parts is a mixture of a metaphor and a simile. In some languages it may be natural to translate it as either a metaphor or a simile (not a mixture). For example:

> Your enemy the devil is a roaring lion that prowls around looking for something to eat.

> Your enemy the devil is like a roaring lion that prowls around looking for something to eat.

#### 5:8b

**Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion,**

* Your enemy, Satan, is walking/going around like a lion who is roaring and
* For you have an enemy, the devil. He is like a roaring lion who roams about
* For Satan is your enemy, and he is as dangerous as a lion that goes around growling loudly

**Your adversary the devil:** The phrases *Your adversary* and *the devil* both refer to Satan, the chief of all the demons.

**Your adversary:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *Your adversary* can be translated as:

> the one who opposes you

> the one who hates you

**the devil:** The phrase *the devil* here refers to the chief of all the devils or demons. In some languages it may be natural to make this clear by using the name:

> Satan

**prowls around:** Someone who *prowls around* goes here and there as an animal does when it is looking for food. Some other ways to translate this phrase include:

> goes around (NCV)

> sneaking around (CEV)

**like a roaring lion:** This is a simile. Peter compared Satan to a *lion*. If there is no word for *lion* in your language, substitute the name of any fierce animal of prey such as:

> leopard

> hyena

**roaring:** This is the very loud noise that a lion makes. Another way to translate this is:

> growling loudly

#### 5:8c

**seeking someone to devour.**

* looking for something to eat/consume.
* as he hunts for his prey.

**seeking someone to devour:** This phrase is part of the metaphor. Just as lions look around for animals to eat, Satan is also looking for opportunities to destroy people. He wants to do this by causing them to stop trusting in Christ.

**someone:** Lions look for animals to eat, but the devil does not want to destroy an animal. He wants to destroy a person. You may need to change this to a general word that could cover both people and animals. For example:

> prey

**devour:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *devour* means “eat up completely.” This is a metaphor referring to destroying someone for one’s own benefit. Satan wants to destroy believers. Some other ways to translate this are:

> consume

> destroy

* **Associated Passages:** 1PE 5:8

## 1 Peter 5:9 (id: 474586)

### Section 5:1–11: Instructions for God’s people

In this section Peter addressed the church community and gave them words of encouragement. First, he addressed the leaders and commanded them to be faithful in looking after the believers. He then addressed younger men in the church, and finally the whole community. He concluded this section by reminding them of God’s faithfulness.

Some other headings for this section include:

> Leading and Living in God’s Flock (NET)

> Advice for Elders and Young Men (NLT)

### Paragraph 5:8–11

Peter reminded his readers that Satan was their enemy and they needed to remain alert and steadfast. God would remain faithful to them and would bring them through their suffering to heaven.

#### 5:9a

**Resist him, standing firm in your faith**

* Do not give way to the devil. Be/Remain strong in your faith.
* Continue to trust completely in God, and resist Satan.

**Resist him:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *Resist him* means to refuse to do what Satan wants. Believers should oppose Satan by not yielding to temptation. Some other ways to translate this phrase are:

> Refuse to give in to him (NCV)

> Stand up to him (REB)

**standing firm in your faith:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates literally as *standing firm in your faith* means “continuing to trust in God strongly.” Some other ways to translate standing firm include:

> stay strong (CEV)

> be strong (NLT)

**your faith:** There are two ways to understand the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *your faith*, which is literally “the faith”:

1. It means your faith and refers to the believer’s personal trust in God. For example:

    > your faith (GNT) *(BSB, REB, GNT, CEV, NASB, RSV, NJB, NET, NLT, NCV)*

2. It means the faith and refers to the Christian religion. For example:

    > the faith (GW) *(KJV, NIV, GW)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), along with the majority of English versions and commentaries.

##### **General Comment on 5:9a**

In some languages it may be natural to reverse the order of these clauses. For example:

> Be firm in your faith and resist him (GNT)

#### 5:9b

**and in the knowledge that**

* You should remember/know that

**and in the knowledge that:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *and in the knowledge that* is literally “knowing.” It introduces a reason for resisting the devil and staying firm in one’s faith. That reason is given in 5:9c. Other ways of translating this word include:

> Remember that (NLT)

> You know that (CEV)

#### 5:9c

**your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kinds of suffering.**

* your Christian brothers and sisters all over the world are suffering in the same way you are.
* you are not the only people who must suffer. Your fellow believers in all the world suffers like you are suffering.

**your brothers:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *your brothers* here is literally “your brotherhood.” It refers to other Christians, to people who believed in Jesus Christ as Peter’s readers did. Some other ways to translate this phrase are:

> your Christian brothers and sisters (NLT)

> other believers (GW)

**are undergoing the same kinds of suffering:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *are undergoing the same kind of sufferings* suggests that it was necessary for the believers to suffer in this way. The suffering was something that had to be endured. It was a necessary part of God’s purpose. The RSV makes this explicit:

> the same experience of suffering is required

Other English versions leave the idea of necessity implicit. For example:

> are enduring the same kinds of suffering (NET)

> are going through the same kinds of suffering (REB)

If it is possible in your language, try to suggest that such suffering was necessary for other Christians also.

### Section 5:1–11: Instructions for God’s people

In this section Peter addressed the church community and gave them words of encouragement. First, he addressed the leaders and commanded them to be faithful in looking after the believers. He then addressed younger men in the church, and finally the whole community. He concluded this section by reminding them of God’s faithfulness.

Some other headings for this section include:

> Advice for Elders and Young Men (NLT)

### Paragraph 5:8–11

Peter reminded his readers that Satan was their enemy and they needed to remain alert and steadfast. God would remain faithful to them and would bring them through their suffering to heaven.

#### 5:10

This is a complicated verse that is one long sentence in the BSB, as it is in the Greek. In some languages it may be natural to break it up into shorter sentences, as in the CEV. For example:

> But God shows undeserved kindness to everyone. That’s why he had Christ Jesus choose you to share in his eternal glory. You will suffer for a while, but God will make you complete, steady, strong, and firm.

It may then be necessary to supply an introductory phrase such as:

> Remember that

#### 5:10a

**And after you have suffered for a little while,**

* You are suffering now, but after a short time
* You will have to go though bad times a little longer.

**And:** There are two ways of interpreting the Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as *And*:

1. It introduces a contrast to the previous thought. For example:

    > But (GNT) *(GNT, CEV, KJV)*

2. It introduces a continuation of the previous thought. For example:

    > And (NET) *(BSB, NIV, ESV, NET, RSV, NCV)*

The NASB, NJB, REB and NLT do not explicitly translate this conjunction. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). You may translate the conjunction explicitly, or you may leave it implicit if that is more natural in your language.

**after you have suffered for a little while:** Peter referred to the way in which his readers were suffering at the time he was writing.

**a little while:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *a little while* also occurs in 1:6b. It is vague as to the length of time, but in relation to eternity it is “short.” The restoration promised may be in this life or later when Jesus Christ is revealed. Another way to translate this expression is:

> a short time

#### 5:10b

**the God of all grace,**

* the God who shows/gives great grace/kindness to his people
* But you should also remember/know that God is very gracious to us

**the God of all grace:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *the God of all grace* means “the God who gives all grace” or “the very gracious/kind God.” A similar phrase is used in 2 Corinthians 1:3, “the God of all comfort.”

In some languages the phrase *the God of all grace* may suggest that there are other gods who are not very gracious. If that is the case in your language, you may need to omit the definite article “the.” For example:

> God, who gives all grace (NCV)

In some languages it may be necessary to make explicit to whom God gives grace. If that is the case in your language, supply a general object such as “us,” “you.” or “all people.” For example:

> God, who shows you his kindness (GW)

> God shows undeserved kindness to everyone (NCV)

**grace:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *grace* here means “undeserved kindness/goodness.” See how you translated this word in 1:2e and 1:10a and 5:5d.

#### 5:10c

**who has called you to His eternal glory in Christ,**

* will enable you to share with Christ in his glory that will never end.
* He has summoned us to be united with Christ in unending glory.

**who has called you to His eternal glory in Christ:** Peter was saying that God had chosen the believers to share in his glory. He implied that his readers would actually reach that glory to which God had called them. In some languages it may be necessary to make this explicit:

> who will bring you to his eternal glory

> who will cause you to share in his eternal glory

**His eternal glory:** The phrase *eternal glory* refers to honor that lasts for ever. See how you translated *glory* in 5:1b and 5:4b. Some other ways to translate *eternal* are:

> unending

> that lasts for ever

**in Christ:** The phrase *in Christ* indicates the means in which we are called to share God’s glory. Some other ways this phrase may be translated are:

> in union with Christ (GNT)

> by means of Christ Jesus (NLT)

In some languages it may be more natural to express *in Christ* as a separate clause. For example:

> this is possible because of our being united with Christ

> this happens because we are one with Christ

#### 5:10d–e

**will Himself restore you, secure you, strengthen you, and establish you:** In the Greek these words are all verbs. They describe four things that God will do to strengthen the Christians when their time of suffering is over. The verbs have similar meanings, and Peter uses four of them together for emphasis.

#### 5:10d

**will Himself restore you,**

* God will make you whole/new
* God himself will bring you back to wholeness

**will Himself restore you:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *restore* means to repair, put into good condition, make whole again. Another way to translate this expression is:

> will make you(plur) whole

#### 5:10e

**secure you, strengthen you, and establish you.**

* and will cause you to be steady, strong, and unwavering in your faith.
* and will give you support, strength, and a good/sure/stable foundation.

**secure you, strengthen you, and establish you:** There is a textual problem here. Some Greek manuscripts have two verbs in this phrase and some have three:

1. There are three things that God will do: For example:

    > support, strengthen, and establish you (NRSV) *(BSB, KJV, NASB, NIV, NRSV, NJB, NET, CEV, NCV)*

2. There are two things that God will do. For example:

    > establish and strengthen you (RSV) *(RSV, REB)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\), with the majority of English versions.

**secure you, strengthen you:** The two Greek words that the BSB translates as *secure* and *strengthen* are a doublet. This means that these two words mean almost the same thing. Because this is a doublet, it is possible to translate these two words as one:

> strengthen you

**secure:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *secure* refers to God making us more capable. Some other ways to translate this word are:

> confirm (ESV)

**strengthen:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *strengthen* refers to God making us strong with regard to our faith. Some other ways to translate this word are:

> support…you (NRSV)

> make you strong in your spirits (EASY)

**establish you:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *establish you* is a metaphor referring to providing a good foundation for a building. In some languages it may be natural to keep this figure of speech. In other languages it may be more natural to express the meaning. Some other ways to translate this word are:

> place you on a firm foundation (NLT)

> establish you(plur) in your faith

##### **General Comment on 5:10**

In some languages it may be natural to reorder this verse and put the reference to suffering at the beginning. For example:

> You will have to suffer only for a little while: the God of all grace who called you to eternal glory in Christ will restore you, he will confirm, strengthen and support you. (NJB)

He then addressed younger men in the church, and finally the whole community. He concluded this section by reminding them of God’s faithfulness.

Some other headings for this section include:

### Paragraph 5:8–11

Peter reminded his readers that Satan was their enemy and they needed to remain alert and steadfast. God would remain faithful to them and would bring them through their suffering to heaven.

#### 5:11

**To Him be the power forever and ever. Amen.**

* His power/authority lasts forever. Amen.
* He is the one who rules for all time. Indeed, this is true!

**To Him be the power forever and ever:** The BSB has supplied the word *be*. In the Greek text there is no verb in this sentence. So there are two ways of understanding this verse:

1. It is a statement of what is already true. For example:

    > To him belongs the power forever. (NET) *(CEV, NLT, NJB, REB, NCV, GW, NET)See Selwyn page 241, Achtemeier page 246, Michaels page 304, Marshall page 173\.*

2. It is a prayer or the expression of a desire that something would happen. For example:

    > To him be the dominion for ever and ever. (RSV) *(BSB, KJV, NASB, NIV, RSV, GNT)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). This is the view of the majority of commentators.

**forever and ever:** There is a textual problem here:

1. It says for ever. For example:

    > forever (NET) *(GW, GNT, NET)*

2. It says *forever and ever*. For example:

    > for ever and ever (REB) *(BSB, KJV, REB, NIV, NASB, RSV, NJB, NCV)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\), which is has the strongest support among scholars.

The expression *forever and ever* means “eternally, for all time.” It is similar in meaning to “eternal” in 5:10b. Another way to translate this expression is:

> for all time

**Amen:** In this context, the word *Amen* means “This is true!” or “Truly, this is so!” See how you translated this word in 4:11d.

* **Associated Passages:** 1PE 5:11

## 1 Peter 5:12 (id: 474589)

### Section 5:12–14: Final greetings

Peter ended his letter with a final word of encouragement and with greetings from local Christians. It may well be that Peter himself, and not Silvanus, wrote this final section with his own hand, in accordance with the common practice of that time.

Some other headings for this section include:

> Peter concluded his letter

> Peter’s final greetings

#### 5:12a

**Through Silvanus,**

* ¶ Silas has helped me to write this letter.
* ¶ In writing this letter I have received help from Silas,

**Through Silvanus:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *Through Silvanus* indicates that Silvanus, who is also called Silas in the New Testament, helped Peter write this letter. Commentators differ as to how he did that:

1. Silvanus helped Peter draft the letter. For example:

    > Silvanus helped me write this short letter (CEV) *(NIV, GNT, CEV, NCV)*

2. Silvanus was the one who would deliver the letter. For example:

    > I’ve written this short letter to you and I’m sending it by Silvanus (GW) *(GW)*

Many versions are ambiguous, but it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), with the majority of commentators.

**Silvanus:** Commentators think that by *Silvanus*, Peter was referring to the same person who accompanied Paul on his journeys (Acts 15:40\). In Acts he is called Silas. Some English versions follow the Greek and others translate this name as “Silas.” It is recommended that you follow the translation of your national or regional translation.

#### 5:12b

**whom I regard as a faithful brother,**

* I consider him as a faithful brother in Christ.
* whom I know to be a faithful Christian.

**whom I regard as a faithful brother:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *whom I regard as a faithful brother* means that Peter viewed Silvanus as a faithful Christian believer. Peter was implying that his readers should also view Silvanus in this way and receive him warmly.

**faithful:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *faithful* in this context means someone who keeps his word and can be trusted. See how you translated this word in 4:19b, where it is used to describe God.

**brother:** The Greek word that the BSB translates literally as *brother* here refers to a fellow believer, a brother in Christ.

#### 5:12c

**I have written to you briefly,**

* I have written this short letter to you
* I am writing this short letter to you

**I have written:** Peter is referring to this letter. As he was still writing it at the time he wrote these words, it may be more natural to say in your language:

> I write

> I am writing

#### 5:12d

**encouraging you**

* to encourage you
* in order to strengthen your hearts.

**encouraging you:** Peter wrote this letter in order to encourage his readers to keep on trusting Jesus even while they were suffering. In some languages it may be natural to translate this as an explicit purpose clause:

> to encourage you to keep on believing/trusting Jesus Christ

#### 5:12e

**and testifying that this is the true grace of God.**

* and witness to you that this letter truly explains God’s kindness to us.
* I want also to say that truly God shows favour to us in the way I have told you.

**testifying:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *testifying* is a strong verb that means to declare that something is true. Peter says here that everything he has written in this letter about God’s grace is true. Here is another way to translate this word:

> declaring (RSV)

**this is the true grace of God:** Peter did not say what *this* refers to. Commentators suggest that *this* refers to the message of his letter. Peter was saying that all that he had written in his letter about God’s grace was true. So you could translate this as:

> what I am writing about God’s grace is true.

**true grace of God:** The phrase *true grace of God* here refers to God’s goodness or kindness. Other ways this phrase has been translated include:

> God’s genuine good will (GW)

> how kind God really is (CEV)

#### 5:12f

**Stand firm in it.**

* Do not ever stop trusting God’s grace.
* So keep on trusting him.

**Stand firm in it:** The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as *Stand fast in it* is a figure of speech. It means that the Christians should continue to trust in God’s grace and never turn away from him. Some other ways this phrase has been translated include:

> keep on having faith in him (CEV)

> Remain firmly established in it! (GW)

### Section 5:12–14: Final greetings

Peter ended his letter with a final word of encouragement and with greetings from local Christians. It may well be that Peter himself, and not Silvanus, wrote this final section with his own hand, in accordance with the common practice of that time.

Some other headings for this section include:

> Peter concluded his letter

> Peter’s final greetings

#### 5:13a

**The church in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings,**

* ¶ The church in Babylon that God has chosen together with you sends you greetings.
* ¶ The believers here in Babylon greet you. God has chosen them to be his people as he has chosen you.

**The church in Babylon:** Here the Greek says literally “She in Babylon.” Most commentators think that this is a figure of speech and that Peter was referring to a church. The BSB makes this explicit, as do some other translations. For example:

> Your sister church in Babylon (GNT)

**Babylon:** *Babylon* is probably a secret name for Rome. So most commentators think that “She in Babylon” refers to the church in Rome, the city from which Peter was writing the letter. This information can be included in a footnote, if you are using footnotes in your translation.

Peter probably used *Babylon* as a symbolic name for Rome because Rome was then the capital of the pagan world, just as Babylon had been the capital of the ancient pagan world. In Old Testament times Babylon was a godless city that was the center of opposition to God’s people. Babylon was also where the Jews lived when they were exiled from their own land, and Peter had described the people he was writing to as exiles (1:1c; 2:11a).

**chosen together with you:** Peter was saying that God had chosen the believers in Babylon/Rome to be his people, just as he had chosen the Christians to whom Peter was writing.

This expression is passive. It may be more natural in your language to make it active and to indicate that God was the one who chose these believers. For example:

> God has chosen them (EASY)

#### 5:13b

**as does my son Mark.**

* My son Mark also greets you.
* Mark, whom I love as a son, also sends his greetings.

**my son Mark:** *Mark* is probably the John Mark mentioned in Acts 12:12 who went with Paul on his first missionary journey. When Peter calls Mark *my son*, that does not mean that Peter was his real father, but that *Mark* was dear to Peter. If in your language “my son” would mean that Peter had fathered Mark, then you may need to make it clear that this is only a figure of speech. For example, you could say:

> who is like a son to me

> who is as dear to me as a son

### Section 5:12–14: Final greetings

Peter ended his letter with a final word of encouragement and with greetings from local Christians. It may well be that Peter himself, and not Silvanus, wrote this final section with his own hand, in accordance with the common practice of that time.

Some other headings for this section include:

> Peter concluded his letter

> Peter’s final greetings

#### 5:14a

**Greet one another with a kiss of love.**

* Greet one another and embrace to show you love one another.
* Show your love for one another with a kiss/hug.

**Greet one another with a kiss of love:** A similar command appears at the end of four of Paul’s letters. See Romans 16:16, 1 Corinthians 16:20, 2 Corinthians 13:12, and 1 Thessalonians 5:6\. In New Testament times, members of a family showed their love for one another by greeting each other with a kiss on the cheek or forehead. It was also the custom in the meetings of the early church for Christians to express their affection for their fellow believers by kissing each other on the cheek or forehead.

Today in cultures where kissing is practiced, it is often strongly associated with sexual love, so a literal translation might convey the wrong meaning. In other cultures the custom of kissing is not known. In either case it may be better to use the word for the usual greeting or a general word such “embrace.” For example:

> Give each other a warm greeting (CEV)

> embrace each other as fellow believers

If you use the word *kiss*, you may need to make clear the kind of kiss that Peter had in mind and the reason for it:

> kiss on the cheek to show your love for your fellow Christians.

#### 5:14b

**Peace to all of you who are in Christ.**

* May all of you who are in Christ live in peace/harmony.
* May God give peace to you all who are joined/belong to Christ.

**Peace to all of you who are in Christ:** This is a blessing. Peter concluded his letter by giving his readers the blessing of peace. In some languages it may be necessary to make it explicit that God is the one who gives peace. For example:

> May God give peace to all of you who are in Christ.

**Peace:** The Greek word that the BSB translates as *Peace* here refers to having a quiet heart and life and a good relationship with God and other people. See how you translated this word in 1:2e. In some languages you may need to translate it as a verb:

> May you be calm/peaceful
