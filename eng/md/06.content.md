## Joshua 1:1 (id: 515837)

### Section 1:1–9 Yahweh spoke to Joshua

In this section Yahweh commanded Joshua to lead the Israelites into the land that he had promised them. He told Joshua that no enemy would be able to oppose him, and that he must obey the law which Yahweh gave to Moses. Joshua told the Israelites to prepare to cross the Jordan River.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Yahweh told Joshua to be strong and courageous

> Yahweh told Joshua to lead the people across the Jordan River

### Paragraph 1:1–5

Moses led the Israelite people through the wilderness for forty years. At the end of the book of Deuteronomy the people were almost ready to enter the land of Canaan, and Moses died. Here at the beginning of the book of Joshua, Yahweh put Joshua in command of the Israelites, and told him to lead them into Canaan. Yahweh promised to be with Joshua and to help him.

#### 1:1a

**Now after the death of His servant Moses,**

* ¶ After Moses the servant of Yahweh died,
* ¶ Moses had recently died. He was a person who served Yahweh.

**after the death of His servant Moses:** The *death of…Moses* is described in Deuteronomy 34\. The book of Joshua follows that story. This sentence is the opening words of a new book. Think about the natural way to begin a new book in your language. In some languages it may be better to begin with a main clause, for example:

> Moses had recently died

**His servant Moses:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *servant* can also be translated as “slave.” It refers to someone who must obey the commands of a master. It is recommended that you use a term that indicates the lowly position of a slave or a servant.

In some languages it may be more natural to place Moses’ title *His servant* after his name, for example:

> Moses, Yahweh’s servant

In some languages it may be more natural to use the verb “serve” instead of the noun servant, for example:

> Moses, a man who served Yahweh

##### **General Comment on 1:1a**

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> After Moses, Yahweh’s servant, died

> Moses had recently died. He was a man who served Yahweh.

#### 1:1b

**the LORD spoke to Joshua son of Nun, Moses’ assistant, saying,**

* Yahweh spoke to Nun’s son, Joshua, who had assisted Moses.
* Then Yahweh spoke to Joshua. Joshua’s father was Nun, and he was the person who helped Moses.

**the LORD spoke to Joshua son of Nun:** This is the first event of the book. If you used a main clause to translate 1:1a you may want to use a temporal phrase here, such as “at that time.”

Here is another way to translate this clause:

> At that time Yahweh said to Joshua the son of Nun

**the LORD:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates *LORD* is “Yahweh,” the personal name of God. See the notes in the Introduction on how to translate this term.

**Joshua son of Nun:** In some languages it may be more natural to say:

> Joshua whose father was called Nun

**Moses’ assistant:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *assistant* comes from a verb that means “to be an attendant on” or “to wait on.” It is different from the Hebrew word translated as “servant” in 1:1a. This word was used when Joshua accompanied Moses up Mount Sinai (Exodus 24:13\) where the BSB translated it as “attendant.” Joshua’s task was not that of a servant but of an assistant.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> the person who helped Moses

> Moses’ aide (NIV)

> Moses’ helper (GNT)

Here are some ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Yahweh said to Joshua, Nun’s son, who had been Moses’ assistant

> Yahweh spoke to Joshua. Joshua was the son of Nun, and he was the person who had helped Moses

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:1

## Joshua 1:2 (id: 515839)

### Section 1:1–9 Yahweh spoke to Joshua

In this section Yahweh commanded Joshua to lead the Israelites into the land that he had promised them. He told Joshua that no enemy would be able to oppose him, and that he must obey the law which Yahweh gave to Moses. Joshua told the Israelites to prepare to cross the Jordan River.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Yahweh told Joshua to be strong and courageous

> Yahweh told Joshua to lead the people across the Jordan River

### Paragraph 1:1–5

Moses led the Israelite people through the wilderness for forty years. At the end of the book of Deuteronomy the people were almost ready to enter the land of Canaan, and Moses died. Here at the beginning of the book of Joshua, Yahweh put Joshua in command of the Israelites, and told him to lead them into Canaan. Yahweh promised to be with Joshua and to help him.

#### 1:2a

**“Moses My servant is dead.**

* Yahweh said: “Moses my servant is dead.
* Yahweh said: “Moses served me, but he has died.

**Moses My servant is dead:** You should translate the word *servant* the same way you did in 1:1a.

**My:** The word *My* refers to Yahweh. It was Yahweh who was speaking.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> My servant Moses is dead

> Moses served me, and now he has died

#### 1:2b

**Now therefore arise, you and all these people, and cross over the Jordan**

* Now, prepare to cross the Jordan River, you(sing) and all these people.
* So now, get ready. You must lead all these Israelites across the Jordan River.

**Now therefore arise:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *arise* is more literally “get up.” It is an idiom that indicates the beginning of an action. For example:

> get ready to cross the Jordan River (NIV)

**you and all these people:** The phrase *you and all these people* refers to Joshua and all the Israelites.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Get ready to cross the Jordan River, you and all the people of Israel

> You and all the Israelites must prepare to cross the Jordan River

> Now get ready to lead all the Israel people across the Jordan River

**cross over the Jordan:** The clause *cross over the Jordan* is a command to cross the Jordan River. The Israelites were on the east side of the Jordan River, and the land of Canaan was on the west side. The river is referred to as *the Jordan* because it was close to the place where Joshua was.

#### 1:2c

**into the land that I am giving to the children of Israel.**

* Enter the land which I am giving to them, the people of Israel.
* Go into the land I am giving to all of you.

**into the land that I am giving to the children of Israel:** In some languages it may be clearer to start a new sentence here. For example:

> Go into the land

**to the children of Israel:** The phrase *to the children of Israel* is used for emphasis. It emphasizes that Yahweh was giving the land of Canaan to the *children of Israel* to live in. Joshua was a part of the people of Israel. In some languages it may be clearer to include Joshua in this phrase.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> to you(plur) the people of Israel

> to you(sing) and the people of Israel

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Enter the land that I am giving to you and to all the Israelites

> Go into the land which I am giving to all of you

> You must go into the land that I am giving to all the Israel people

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:2

## Joshua 1:3 (id: 515841)

### Section 1:1–9 Yahweh spoke to Joshua

In this section Yahweh commanded Joshua to lead the Israelites into the land that he had promised them. He told Joshua that no enemy would be able to oppose him, and that he must obey the law which Yahweh gave to Moses. Joshua told the Israelites to prepare to cross the Jordan River.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Yahweh told Joshua to be strong and courageous

> Yahweh told Joshua to lead the people across the Jordan River

### Paragraph 1:1–5

Moses led the Israelite people through the wilderness for forty years. At the end of the book of Deuteronomy the people were almost ready to enter the land of Canaan, and Moses died. Here at the beginning of the book of Joshua, Yahweh put Joshua in command of the Israelites, and told him to lead them into Canaan. Yahweh promised to be with Joshua and to help him.

#### 1:3a

**I have given you every place where the sole of your foot will tread,**

* I have given you(plur) everywhere that you place your feet,
* Everywhere that you walk/tread I have given to you.

**I have given you:** There are two ways to interpret the Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *I have given you*.

1. Some English versions translate with the past tense. For example:

    > I have given to you (ESV) *(BSB, ESV, RSV, NASB, KJV, REB, GNT, NLT)*

2. Some English versions translate with the future tense. For example:

    > I will give you (NIV) *(NIV, NJB, NCV, GW, CEV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). The Israelites had not yet entered Canaan, but because Yahweh promised it, it was as certain as if they were already there.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> I have given you(plur) everywhere that you(plur) place your feet

> Every place where you walk I have given to you

**every place where the sole of your foot will tread:** The phrase *every place where the sole of your foot will tread* indicates that Yahweh will give the Israelites every part of the land that they walk on.

**your:** The Hebrew pronouns in this verse are plural: “your(plur) feet,” and “given to you(plur).” Yahweh spoke to all the people of Israel.

#### 1:3b

**just as I promised to Moses.**

* as I promised Moses.
* This was the promise I made to Moses.

**I promised to Moses:** Yahweh promised Moses that he would give the land of Canaan to the Israelites in Exodus 3:8\. He repeated this promise in Deuteronomy 11:24

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> just as I promised Moses

> I promise you what I promised to Moses (NLT)

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 1:3

## Joshua 1:4 (id: 515843)

### Section 1:1–9 Yahweh spoke to Joshua

In this section Yahweh commanded Joshua to lead the Israelites into the land that he had promised them. He told Joshua that no enemy would be able to oppose him, and that he must obey the law which Yahweh gave to Moses. Joshua told the Israelites to prepare to cross the Jordan River.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Yahweh told Joshua to be strong and courageous

> Yahweh told Joshua to lead the people across the Jordan River

### Paragraph 1:1–5

Moses led the Israelite people through the wilderness for forty years. At the end of the book of Deuteronomy the people were almost ready to enter the land of Canaan, and Moses died. Here at the beginning of the book of Joshua, Yahweh put Joshua in command of the Israelites, and told him to lead them into Canaan. Yahweh promised to be with Joshua and to help him.

#### 1:4a

**Your territory shall extend from the wilderness and Lebanon**

* Your land will extend from the desert in the south to the Lebanon mountains in the north.
* Your borders will reach from the wilderness in the south to the mountains of Lebanon in the north.

In verse 1:4 Yahweh described the four sides of the land that he was giving to the Israelite people: the south and the north, the east and the west.

**from the wilderness:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *wilderness* refers to the dry area in the south of the land of Canaan. Because it was dry, few people lived there, and it was difficult to grow crops there.

Here are some other ways to translate the word *wilderness*:

> desert

> deserted place

> dry land

**and Lebanon:** The word *Lebanon* refers to a range of mountains at the north end of the land that Yahweh gave to the Israelites. These mountains had snow on them all year long, and the word *Lebanon* means “white” in Semitic languages. The country of Lebanon did not yet exist at this time.

Here are some ways to translate this term:

> Lebanon Mountains (GNT)

> Lebanon mountain range

**Lebanon:** The Hebrew is literally “the Lebanon,” which is difficult to understand. The mountains of Lebanon were a long way from where the Israelites were. Possibly it means “over there”, but no English version translates it that way. Many versions omit it, and you may do the same.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse.

> Your land will extend from the wilderness in the south to the mountains of Lebanon in the north.

> Your borders will reach from the desert in the south to the Lebanon Mountains in the north (GNT)

#### 1:4b

**to the great River Euphrates—all the land of the Hittites—**

* It will extend from the great river Euphrates in the east, and across all the land that belongs to the Heth people.
* Your borders will extend to the great Euphrates River in the east and include all the land of the people of Heth.

**to the great River Euphrates:** The *River Euphrates* was on the east side of the land that God gave to the Israelites. The phrase *the great River* describes the Euphrates River. The Euphrates River was very wide.

**all the land of the Hittites:** The term *Hittites* refers to one of groups of people who lived in the land of Canaan. The phrase *all the land of the Hittites* is another way to refer to the land of Canaan.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> It will extend from the great Euphrates River in the east, across the land that belongs to the Hittites

> Your borders will reach from the great river Euphrates in the east and include all the land of the Hitti people

#### 1:4c

**and west as far as the Great Sea.**

* It will go to the Mediterranean Sea in the west.
* Your borders will extend to the Mediterranean Sea on the west where the sun sets.

**and west:** The phrase *and west* refers to the west. The Mediterranean Sea was the western boundary of the land that Israel received.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Your land will reach to the Mediterranean Sea in the west

> to the Mediterranean Sea where the sun sets

**as far as the Great Sea:** The term *the Great Sea* refers to the Mediterranean Sea.

##### **General Comment on 1:4**

In some languages it may be clearer to reorder the parts of this verse. For example:

> Your land will reach from the Negeb wilderness in the south to the Lebanon mountains in the north. It will reach from the great Euphrates River in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west. It will include all the land of the Hittites.

## Joshua 1:5 (id: 515844)

### Section 1:1–9 Yahweh spoke to Joshua

In this section Yahweh commanded Joshua to lead the Israelites into the land that he had promised them. He told Joshua that no enemy would be able to oppose him, and that he must obey the law which Yahweh gave to Moses. Joshua told the Israelites to prepare to cross the Jordan River.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Yahweh told Joshua to be strong and courageous

> Yahweh told Joshua to lead the people across the Jordan River

### Paragraph 1:1–5

Moses led the Israelite people through the wilderness for forty years. At the end of the book of Deuteronomy the people were almost ready to enter the land of Canaan, and Moses died. Here at the beginning of the book of Joshua, Yahweh put Joshua in command of the Israelites, and told him to lead them into Canaan. Yahweh promised to be with Joshua and to help him.

#### 1:5a

**No one shall stand against you all the days of your life.**

* No enemy will be able to defeat you(sing) as long as you live.
* Nobody will be able to stand against you all your life.

**No one shall stand against you:** The expression *stand against* means “resist” or “oppose.” Yahweh told Joshua that no enemy would be able to defeat him.

**you:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *you* is singular, and refers to Joshua.

**all the days of your life:** The phrase *all the days of your life* indicates for as long as Joshua lived.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> No one will succeed in fighting with you(sing) all your life

> No one will be able to defeat you as long as you live (GNT)

#### 1:5b

**As I was with Moses, so will I be with you;**

* I will be with you(sing) as I was with Moses.
* I helped Moses, and I will help you.

**As I was with Moses, so will I be with you:** Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> I will be with you in the same way that I was with Moses

> I will help you as I helped Moses

#### 1:5c

**I will never leave you nor forsake you.**

* I will not leave you or abandon you.
* I will always be with you. I will never leave you.

**I will never leave you nor forsake you:** The Hebrew verbs that the BSB translates as *leave* and *forsake* are close in meaning. The use of two verbs shows emphasis in Hebrew. In some languages the use of two synonymous verbs may not show emphasis. It might be unnatural or confusing to use two words that mean the same thing. If this is true in your language, you could use only one word but add an intensifier, for example:

> I will never fail you

> I will definitely not abandon you

You could also use two expressions with the same meaning, one positive and one negative. For example:

> I will always be with you; I will never abandon you (GNT)

Here is another way to translate this part of the verse.

> I will not leave you or forget you (NCV)

## Joshua 1:6 (id: 515846)

### Section 1:1–9 Yahweh spoke to Joshua

In this section Yahweh commanded Joshua to lead the Israelites into the land that he had promised them. He told Joshua that no enemy would be able to oppose him, and that he must obey the law which Yahweh gave to Moses. Joshua told the Israelites to prepare to cross the Jordan River.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Yahweh told Joshua to be strong and courageous

> Yahweh told Joshua to lead the people across the Jordan River

### Paragraph 1:6–9

God encouraged Joshua to be brave and to be faithful to the law.

#### 1:6a

**Be strong and courageous,**

* ¶ Be strong and do not be afraid.
* ¶ Be determined and confident.

**Be strong and courageous:** The phrases *Be strong* and *\[be] courageous* have a similar meaning. The use of these two synonyms shows emphasis in Hebrew. In some languages it may be unnatural or confusing to use two words that mean the same thing. If this is true in your language, you could use one word and add an intensifier, for example:

> be very brave

You could also use two words with the same meaning, one positive and one negative. For example:

> be strong and do not be afraid

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Be determined and confident (GNT)

> Be very courageous

#### 1:6b

**for you shall give these people the inheritance of the land**

* You will lead these people so that they inherit the land
* You must lead these people so they can take the land.

**for:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *for* introduces the reason why Joshua must be brave. He must be brave because he was going to lead the Israelites into Canaan.

**you shall give these people the inheritance of the land:** The clause *you shall give these people the inheritance of the land* means that Joshua will lead the Israelites to take the land that Yahweh will give them. Usually, a person does not inherit something until someone has died. In the book of Joshua, Yahweh gave the land of Canaan as an inheritance to the Israelites. The word *inheritance* means that the Israelites took possession of the land. Some languages may not use the word *inheritance* in this way.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> because you will lead them so that they inherit the land

> You must lead these people so they can take the land (NCV)

> because you will help these people take possession of the land (GW)

**you:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *you* is emphatic. In English we might express this as:

> it is you who will cause this people to inherit the land

If you have emphatic pronouns in your language, you may be able to use one here.

#### 1:6c

**that I swore to their fathers I would give them.**

* that I promised their/your fathers that I will give them.
* This is the land which I vowed to give to their/your ancestors.

**that I swore:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *swore* can also be translated as:

> vowed

> promised

**to their fathers I would give them:** The word *fathers* refers to the ancestors of the Israelites, that is, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Yahweh promised Abraham, Isaac and Jacob that he would give them the land of Canaan. See, for example, Genesis 13:14–15\. These people were also the ancestors of Joshua. In some languages it may be more natural to translate the phrase *to their fathers* as “to your fathers.”

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> that I promised their/your fathers that I would give them

> which I vowed to give to their/your ancestors

> I promised their fathers that I would give them this land (ERV)

## Joshua 1:7 (id: 515848)

### Section 1:1–9 Yahweh spoke to Joshua

In this section Yahweh commanded Joshua to lead the Israelites into the land that he had promised them. He told Joshua that no enemy would be able to oppose him, and that he must obey the law which Yahweh gave to Moses. Joshua told the Israelites to prepare to cross the Jordan River.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Yahweh told Joshua to be strong and courageous

> Yahweh told Joshua to lead the people across the Jordan River

### Paragraph 1:6–9

God encouraged Joshua to be brave and to be faithful to the law.

#### 1:7a

**Above all, be strong and very courageous.**

* Be strong and do not be afraid.
* Be determined and very confident.

**Above all, be strong and very courageous:** The Hebrew words that the BSB translates as *be strong* and *\[be] very courageous* are the same as those translated “be strong” and “\[be] courageous” in 1:6a. You should translate them the same way in both places.

**Above all:** The phrase *Above all* makes the command stronger.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> you must be strong and very courageous

**very:** There is a textual issue with this part of the verse.

1. The Hebrew text includes the word *very* *(BSB, RSV, NIV, NET, REB, GW, NJPS, NASB, NLT, KJV)*
2. The Septuagint, the early Greek translation, does not have the word *very* *(GNT, NCV, CEV)*

It is recommended that you follow the Hebrew text and include a word that means *very*.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> You must be strong and very courageous

> Be determined and very brave

#### 1:7b

**Be careful to observe all the law that My servant Moses commanded you.**

* You must carefully keep all the commandments which my servant Moses commanded you.
* Be careful to obey all the instructions that Moses who served me gave you.

**Be careful to observe all the law:** The clause *Be careful to observe* indicates that Joshua must follow all the law.

**all the law:** The phrase *all the law* refers to the laws and commandments that Yahweh gave to Moses to pass on to the Israelites.

**that My servant Moses commanded you:** Yahweh referred to Moses as *My servant* in verse 1:2a, and you should translate it the same way in both places.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> You must carefully keep all the commandments that my servant Moses commanded you

> Be sure to follow all the laws that Moses, my servant, told you to do

#### 1:7c

**Do not turn from it to the right or to the left,**

* Do not stop obeying any of them,
* Follow them exactly.

**Do not turn from it to the right or to the left:** The phrase *Do not turn from it* means that Joshua must not disobey the law.

The phrase *to the right or to the left* is an idiom. It indicates that Joshua must not disobey the law in any way. He must carefully follow every part of the law.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Do not stop obeying any of the law

> follow them exactly (NCV)

> Do not walk away from any of these laws

#### 1:7d

**so that you may prosper wherever you go.**

* in order that you will be successful wherever you go.
* Then it will go well with you in everything you do.

**so that you may prosper wherever you go:** This clause indicates that if Joshua obeyed all the laws, he would prosper wherever he went. However, this means more than “wherever he traveled.” It also means that he would be successful in everything he did.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> so that you will succeed wherever you go

> Then you will be successful in everything you do (NCV)

> then everything will go well with you wherever you go

## Joshua 1:8 (id: 515849)

### Section 1:1–9 Yahweh spoke to Joshua

In this section Yahweh commanded Joshua to lead the Israelites into the land that he had promised them. He told Joshua that no enemy would be able to oppose him, and that he must obey the law which Yahweh gave to Moses. Joshua told the Israelites to prepare to cross the Jordan River.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Yahweh told Joshua to be strong and courageous

> Yahweh told Joshua to lead the people across the Jordan River

### Paragraph 1:6–9

God encouraged Joshua to be brave and to be faithful to the law.

#### 1:8a

**This Book of the Law must not depart from your mouth;**

* Never stop reading this book of the law.
* Always remember what is written in this law book.

**This Book of the Law:** The phrase *This Book of the Law* refers to “all the law” in 1:7b.

**must not depart from your mouth:** The clause *must not depart from your mouth* means that Joshua should always think about the law of Yahweh. He could do this by reading it and speaking it out loud.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Never stop reading this Book of the Law. (NIRV)

> Always remember what is written in this law book

> Do not stop reciting these laws

#### 1:8b

**meditate on it day and night,**

* Think about what it says all day and all night.
* Say it over to yourself in the day and in the night.

**meditate on it:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *meditate* can also be translated as “mutter,” or “read in a low voice.” This was a way to keep thinking about something.

**day and night:** The phrase *day and night* means always or all the time.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Day and night you must think about what it says (NIRV)

> Never stop reciting these teachings (GW)

> Study it day and night (NCV)

#### 1:8c

**so that you may be careful to do everything written in it.**

* Then you will be able to do everything written in it.
* Obey everything that it says.

**so that you may be careful to do everything written in it:** The clause *be careful to do everything written in it* indicates that Joshua must obey all the laws that Moses wrote down.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Make sure you do everything written in it (NIRV)

> Carefully follow every law that Moses wrote

#### 1:8d

**For then you will prosper and succeed in all you do.**

* Then you will be prosperous, and you will have great success.
* If you do that then it will go well with you and you will succeed.

**For then you will prosper and succeed in all you do:** The Hebrew verbs that the BSB translates as *will prosper* and *succeed* are similar in meaning. In some languages there may not be two words with such similar meanings. In that case it may be more natural to translate this as “very successful”, or “very prosperous.”

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Then things will go well with you. And you will have great success. (NIRV)

> Only then will you prosper and succeed (GW)

> If you do that, you will be successful in everything that you do (T4T)

## Joshua 1:9 (id: 515853)

### Section 1:1–9 Yahweh spoke to Joshua

In this section Yahweh commanded Joshua to lead the Israelites into the land that he had promised them. He told Joshua that no enemy would be able to oppose him, and that he must obey the law which Yahweh gave to Moses. Joshua told the Israelites to prepare to cross the Jordan River.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Yahweh told Joshua to be strong and courageous

> Yahweh told Joshua to lead the people across the Jordan River

### Paragraph 1:6–9

God encouraged Joshua to be brave and to be faithful to the law.

#### 1:9a

**Have I not commanded you to be strong and courageous?**

* I have commanded you to be strong and not to be afraid.
* Remember that I told you to be determined and confident.

**Have I not commanded you to be strong and courageous?:** This is a rhetorical question. It functions as a strong statement and emphasizes a fact that is true.

There are two ways to translate this statement:

* Use a question, as the BSB does.
* Use a strong statement. For example:

    > I have commanded you, be strong and courageous (GW)

    > I repeat, be strong and brave (NET)

    > Remember that I have commanded you to be determined and confident (GNT)

Translate this in a way that is natural in your language to express a strong statement.

**be strong and courageous:** The Hebrew words that the BSB translates as *be strong and courageous* are the same as in verse 1:6a. You should translate them the same way in both places. Yahweh commanded Joshua “be strong and courageous” in 1:6a and 1:7a, and he repeated the command here.

#### 1:9b

**Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged,**

* Do not be afraid, but be brave.
* Do not be at all afraid.

**Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged:** These two negative commands have the same meaning as the positive commands in 1:9a. This is a way to emphasize those commands. The command *Do not be afraid* has the same meaning as the command *do not be discouraged*. In some languages it may not be natural to use two verbs that have the same meaning.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Do not be at all frightened

> Do not be frightened, but be brave

#### 1:9c

**for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.”**

* Yahweh your(sing) God, will be with you wherever you go.”
* I, Yahweh the God whom you worship, will go with you in everything you do.”

**for the LORD your God is with you:** The phrase *the LORD your God* is another way to refer to Yahweh. The word for God is added to the personal name of Yahweh. This title for Yahweh indicates that Yahweh is the God whom Joshua worships.

As it is Yahweh who is speaking, another way to translate this isː

> I, Yahweh your God, am with you(sing)

**is with you:** This refers to the time when Yahweh was talking to Joshua. It is also a promise for the future. You could translate this “will be with you” if that would be more natural in your language.

**you:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translate as *you* is singular. It refers to Joshua.

**wherever you go:** The phrase *wherever you go* is the same phrase as is used at the end of verse 7d.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> I, Yahweh your God, am with you in all you do (NET)

> I am Yahweh your God. I will be with you everywhere you go

#### 1:10

**Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people:**

* ¶ Then Joshua ordered the leaders of the people of Israel:
* ¶ So Joshua summoned the leaders of the Israelites and told them

**Then:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *Then* is used to show that the next action in the story will take place. Use a connection that is appropriate in your language for the beginning of a new section.

Here are some other ways to translate this wordː

> And

> So

**Joshua commanded the officers of the people:** In some languages it may be necessary to say that Joshua summoned the officers before he spoke to them.

**officers of the people:** The phrase *officers of the people* refers to the leaders of each Israelite tribe. Choose a word that indicates a position of responsibility and leadership but not of command over all the Israelites.

Here is another way to translate this phraseː

> the leaders of the tribes of Israel

### Paragraph 1:10–11

Joshua told the Israelites that they will soon cross the Jordan River. They must get food ready to take with them.

#### 1:11a

**“Go through the camp and tell the people,**

* “Walk through the camp and give this order to the people.
* to go through the place where the tents were set up. They should order the people

**Go through the camp and tell the people:** This verse gives the content of the command that Joshua gave to the officers. It is in direct speech. In some languages it may be more natural to use indirect speech. For example:

> 10Joshua commanded the officers of the people 11to pass through the camp and command the people

**the camp:** The Israelites lived in tents. The word *camp* refers to the area where they set up their tents.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verseː

> walk all through the camping place and tell the people

> walk by all the tents and order the people

> go through the tent area and command the people

#### 1:11b

**‘Prepare your provisions,**

* Say, ‘Make food ready for a journey.
* to prepare food to take with them.

**Prepare your provisions:** This clause is a speech within a speech. It continues to the end of the verse. Consider whether direct or indirect speech is more appropriate in your language.

**provisions:** The term *provisions* refers to food that the Israelites took with them.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Get your food supplies ready

> Prepare food to take with you

#### 1:11c

**for within three days you will cross the Jordan**

* The day after tomorrow you will cross the Jordan River,
* In three days they were going to cross the Jordan River

**for:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *for* introduces the reason why the Israelites had to get food ready. They were going to cross the Jordan River and conquer the land of Canaan.

**within three days:** The Israelites counted days inclusively. They began with the day from which they were counting.

Here is another way to translate the phrase *within three days*ː

> the day after tomorrow

**you will cross the Jordan:** The clause that the BSB translates as *you will cross the Jordan* indicates that the Israelites will cross the Jordan River. Joshua will cross the river with the people. In some languages it may be more natural to use “we(incl)” instead of *you*.

**the Jordan:** See the note on 1:2b.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Three days from now you will cross the Jordan River (NCV)

> the day after tomorrow we(incl) are going to cross the Jordan River

#### 1:11d

**to go in and take possession of the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess.’”**

* to enter and conquer the land which Yahweh your(plur) God is giving you as your own.’”
* to enter and take over the land which Yahweh their God was giving them.

**to go in and take possession:** The clause *go in and take possession* states the reason why the Israelites were about to cross the Jordan River. The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *take possession* indicates that they would take the land to be their own.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> to occupy the land

> to conquer the land

**the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess:** The clause *the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess* indicates that Yahweh is giving them the land to be their own. It will belong to them.

**your:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *your* is plural. Joshua and the leaders were included in those who worshiped God. In some languages it may be more natural to say “our(incl) God” instead of “your God.”

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> in order to occupy the land that Yahweh your God is giving to you as your own

> and take the land that Yahweh our(incl) God is giving us to live in

##### **General Comment on 1:11b\-d**

In some languages it is more natural to put the reason for an action (1:11c\-d) before the action itself (1:11b). For example:

> 11cThe day after tomorrow you will cross the Jordan River 11dto conquer the land which Yahweh your God is giving you. 11bSo get ready food to take with you.

### Section 1:10–18 Joshua told the Israelites to get ready to cross the Jordan River

In this section Joshua told the Israelites to get ready and prepare food to cross the Jordan River. He reminded the men of Reuben, Gad and the half\-tribe of Manasseh that they would cross the Jordan River with the rest of the Israelites.

Here are some other possible sections headings:

> Preparing to cross the Jordan River

### Paragraph 1:12–15

The tribes of Reuben, Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh already chose land on the east side of the Jordan River. In this paragraph Joshua reminded the men of these tribes about what they promised Moses. They promised to help the other Israelites conquer the land on the west of the Jordan River. When they had done this, they could return to their own territory.

#### 1:12

**But to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half\-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said,**

* ¶ Then Joshua spoke to the people of the clans of Reuben and Gad and half the clan of Manasseh and said:
* ¶ But Joshua said this to the clan of Reuben, the clan of Gad and the half\-clan of Manasseh:

**But to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half\-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said:** In verses 1ː10–11 Joshua spoke to the leaders of the people of Israel. In verses 1:12–15 he spoke to just two and a half of the tribes. The Hebrew text shows this contrast by putting *to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half\-tribe of Manasseh* at the beginning of the sentence. Use the connection and sentence order that is most natural in your language.

**the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half\-tribe of Manasseh:** This refers to the people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh. They already received their territory on the east side of the Jordan. See Numbers 32\.

**tribe:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *tribe* can also be translated “branch” or “clan.” The Israelites were divided into twelve tribes. Each tribe was named after one of the sons of Jacob. The people in the tribe were descendants of that ancestor. Choose a word for a group of people who are descended from a common ancestor. See also the note at Joshua 7:14 where “tribe” and “clan” are used in the same verse.

Here are some other ways to translate the word *tribe*:

> clan

> branch

> division

> descendants

Here are some other ways to translate this verse:

> Then Joshua spoke to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh

#### 1:13a

**“Remember what Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you when he said,**

* “Do not forget(plur) what Moses, Yahweh’s servant, commanded you.
* “You know the command that Moses, the servant of Yahweh, gave you.

**Remember:** The verb *Remember* does not imply that the Israelites had forgotten Moses’ command. Joshua reminded them of something they already knew.

Here are some ways to translate this wordː

> You know

> Do not forget

**what Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you:** The term *what* does not refer to a single word. It refers to all that Moses said to the Reubenites, the Gadites and half of the tribe of Manasseh when they asked for land to settle on the east side of the Jordan.

**Moses the servant of the LORD:** See the note on 1:1a for other ways to translate a similar phrase. Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Remember the command which Moses, Yahweh’s servant, gave you

> Do not forget what Moses, Yahweh’s servant, told you

> Remember how the Lord’s servant Moses told you (GNT)

**when he said:** The phrase *when he said* introduces what Moses said. This is direct speech. In some languages it may be more natural to report what Moses said using indirect speech.

#### 1:13b

**‘The LORD your God will give you rest, and He will give you this land.’**

* He said, ‘Yahweh your(plur) God will make you secure by giving you this land to settle in.’
* He told you that Yahweh your God will give you this land where you may live in safety.

**The LORD your God will give you rest:** The sentence *The LORD your God will give you rest* indicates that Yahweh will give them a permanent place to live. It will be a place where they can live safely.

**and He will give you this land:** The clause *give you this land* further explains the clause “give you rest.” The “rest” that Yahweh will give them is the land they are about to enter. It may be more natural to combine the two expressions, for example:

> Yahweh your God will provide this land for you, where you may live in safety

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Moses said, ‘Yahweh your God is giving you this land. It will be a place where you can make your homes and find rest.’

> Moses said, ‘Yahweh your God will provide this land for you, a place where you may live in safety.’

> Moses told you that the Lord your God would give you this land on the east side of the Jordan as your home. (GNT)

### Paragraph 1:12–15

The tribes of Reuben, Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh already chose land on the east side of the Jordan River. In this paragraph Joshua reminded the men of these tribes about what they promised Moses. They promised to help the other Israelites conquer the land on the west of the Jordan River. When they had done this, they could return to their own territory.

#### 1:14a

**Your wives, your young children, and your livestock may remain in the land that Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan.**

* Your(plur) wives, children and livestock may stay here in the land which Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan River.
* Moses gave you this land east of the Jordan River. Your wives, children and animals may stay here.

**and your livestock:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *livestock* refers to cows and also to sheep and goats. Use a general word for domestic animals.

**may remain in the land that Moses gave you:** Joshua gave permission to the men of the two and a half tribes to let their families stay in the land east of the Jordan River. The men must cross the Jordan River to help the other Israelites.

**on this side of the Jordan:** The phrase *on this side of the Jordan* refers to the east side of the Jordan River. Joshua spoke as if he were already on the west side of the Jordan.

Here are some ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Your wives, your children and your livestock may stay in the land that Moses gave you here on the east side of the Jordan River

> Your wives and children and animals can stay here in the land Moses gave you (CEV)

> Moses gave you this land east of the Jordan River. Your wives, children and animals may stay here

#### 1:14b

**But all your mighty men of valor must be armed for battle to cross over ahead of your brothers**

* But all your(plur) fighting men must lead your brothers across the Jordan, ready for fighting.
* But all the men who are able to fight should cross the Jordan River first, before the other Israelites. You should take your weapons with you.

**But:** This word marks a contrast between the men and their families. The fighting men went with the other tribes across the Jordan River to fight alongside them. Their families remained where they had settled on the east side of the Jordan.

**all your mighty men of valor must be armed for battle to cross over ahead of your brothers:** The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as *all your mighty men of valor must be armed for battle to cross over ahead of your brothers* is more literally “but you shall cross over armed before your brothers, all the mighty men of strength.”

**all your mighty men of valor:** The phrase *all your mighty men of valor* refers to every Israelite man who was able to fight. The Israelites did not have a professional army. Every Israelite man who was over twenty years old and was fit to fight was considered a soldier. Avoid a term which will make your readers think that this refers to paid soldiers.

Here are some other ways to translate this phraseː

> all the men who can fight

> all the soldiers

> all the fighting men

**must be armed for battle to cross over:** The phrase *must be armed for battle to cross over* indicates that the fighting men must cross the Jordan River carrying their weapons. They must be ready to fight.

**ahead of your brothers:** The phrase *ahead of your brothers* indicates that the fighting men of the tribes of Reuben and Gad and of half the tribe of Manasseh must cross the Jordan River in front of the other Israelites. All the Israelites were considered to be brothers, or relatives.

> your fellow Israelites

> your relatives

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> But all your men who are able to fight must carry their weapons and cross the Jordan River in front of their fellow Israelites

> but all your fighting men, ready for battle, must cross over ahead of your fellow Israelites (NIV)

#### 1:14c

**and help them,**

* You(plur) will help them conquer the land.
* You will fight with them,

**and help them:** The clause *help them* indicates that the two and a half tribes must help the other Israelites to fight and conquer the land on the west side of the Jordan River.

* Yahweh will make the peoples of Israel secure, as he made you(plur) secure.
* until Yahweh gives your relatives a place to live as he has given one to you.

**until the LORD gives them rest:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *gives them rest* is the same verb as the BSB translated “give you rest” in 1:13b. You may be able to translate it the same way in both places.

**as He has done for you:** The phrase *as He has done for you* indicates that Yahweh will give a place of safety to the other Israelite tribes as he did for the two and a half tribes.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> until Yahweh gives all the tribes of Israel a secure place to rest just as he did for you

> until Yahweh gives your relatives a place to live as he gave one to you

#### 1:15b

**and your brothers also possess the land that the LORD your God is giving them.**

* When they have settled in the land which Yahweh your(plur) God is giving them,
* After you have conquered the land that Yahweh your God is giving you,

**and your brothers also possess the land:** The clause *and your brothers also possess the land* indicates that the Israelite tribes will own the land. The phrase *your brothers also* is in an emphatic position in the Hebrew sentence. It emphasizes that the other Israelite tribes will receive land just as surely as Gad, Reuben, and the half\-tribe of Manasseh received it.

**that the LORD your God is giving them:** The phrase *the LORD your God* occurred in verse 1:9c. You should translate it the same way in both places.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> When they also have settled in the land that Yahweh your God is giving them

> After they have conquered the land that Yahweh your God is giving them, just as you did

**Then you may return to the land of your inheritance and take possession of**

* then you(plur) may come back to your land here and settle in it.
* you may come back to the land that you have settled in and live here.

**Then you may return to the land of your inheritance:** The phrase *the land of your inheritance* means their own land. It was the land that Moses gave them on the east side of the Jordan River.

**and take possession of:** The noun *possession* and the verb “possess” come from the same root in Hebrew. The Hebrew text uses both the noun and the verb to show emphasis. Some languages may not be able to show emphasis in this way.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> then you shall return to the land which you have settled and occupy it

> then you can come back to your own land and live in it

* This is the land which Moses, Yahweh’s servant, gave you(plur) on the east side of the Jordan River.”
* Moses, the one who served Yahweh, gave you this land on the east bank of the Jordan River.”

**that which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you:** In Hebrew, the phrase used here for *the servant of the LORD* is the same as the phrase used in 1:1a. You should translate it the same way in both places.

**on the east side of the Jordan:** The phrase *on the east side of the Jordan* indicates that the land which Moses gave them was on the east side of the Jordan River.

Some other ways to translate this part of the verse are:

> It is the land here on the east side of the Jordan River, which Moses, Yahweh’s servant, gave to you

> Moses gave you this land on the east bank of the Jordan River

##### **General Comment on 1:12–15**

Verses 12–15 are similar to Deuteronomy 3:18–20\. If you have already translated Deuteronomy, you should compare the similarities and differences so that similar words and phrases are translated in the same way.

> Then

Translate this connector in a way that is natural to introduce a consecutive event.

**they answered Joshua:** The word *they* refers to the people of Reuben and Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh. This list of names was last given in 1:12\. It may be necessary in some languages to specify these names clearly. If you need to do this, you could either repeat the list or use an expression like “those people.” Use whatever is most natural in your language.

> if anyone rebels against your commandment

**rebels against:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *rebels* can also be translated as:

### Section 2:1–24 Joshua sent men to explore Jericho secretly

Joshua sent two men to look at Jericho, a town in the land of Canaan. A woman of Jericho called Rahab hid the two men so that the king’s soldiers could not find them. She did this because she believed that Yahweh would help the Israelites conquer their land. The men promised Rahab that if she did not betray them, they would rescue her and her family when the Israelites conquered the town. Rahab helped the men escape from Jericho and they hid in the hills for three days. When the soldiers of Jericho stopped looking for them, they returned to Joshua.

**Then:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Then* introduces the next event in the narrative. This is the start of a new section, and some English versions start this section with the word “then.” Translate this in a way that is natural to introduce a new section in your language.

**Joshua son of Nun:** You should translate this the same way you did in 1:1b.

**secretly sent two spies from Shittim, saying:** In some languages, a literal translation would suggest that Joshua spoke to the two men after he sent them away. If this is true in your language, you need to make it clear that Joshua gave the orders to the men before they left.

Here is another way to translate this sentence:

> Joshua sent two men secretly from Shittim as spies. Before he sent them, he said

**secretly:** The term *secretly* means that the two men explored the land secretly. They did not want the Canaanites to know where they came from or what they were doing.

**two spies:** These two men were Israelites.

**spies:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *spies* comes from a verb that means “go as an explorer” or “go as a spy.”

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> to explore secretly

> to learn about the land of Canaan

> to see where the land is weak

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Then Joshua, the son of Nun, chose two men from the camp at Shittim to go in secret and explore the land. Before he sent them, he said,

> The Israelites were staying at Shittim Campground. Joshua, the son of Nun, sent two men from there to go secretly and learn about the land. He told them,

**from Shittim:** Shittim was the place where the Israelites set up their tents on the east side of the Jordan River. This place is referred to in Numbers 25:1\. It was northeast of the Dead Sea, opposite Jericho.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> while the Israelites were camping at Shittim

The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Shittim* means “acacia.” It is possible that there were several acacia trees in this area.2:1 Dallaire, p. 864\. Some English versions use the name “Acacia” instead of the name Shittim. If you are familiar with acacia trees, you may choose to use that term instead of Shittim.

Shittim was the name of this area, but it was not a town or a village. If you must identify it you could call it “Shittim campground” or “Shittim region.”

Here are some other ways to translate this Hebrew word:

> Acacia Grove (NLT)

> Shittim campground/region

> Acacia campground/region

#### 2:1b

**“Go, inspect the land, especially Jericho.”**

* “Go(dual) and look at the land and especially the city of Jericho.”
* “Go to the land of Canaan and learn about it. Look particularly at Jericho.”

**Go, inspect the land:** The clause *Go, inspect the land* indicates that the men must go to the land of Canaan and gather information about how to conquer it.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> Go through the land and find out about it

**especially Jericho:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *especially Jericho* is more literally “and Jericho.” Jericho was a town in Canaan that was across the river from the Israelite camp. It was the most important town in that region. There were many towns in Canaan. Joshua told the men to find out especially about this town because they would attack it first.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Go through the land and find out about it, especially the town of Jericho.

> Go and look around the land, particularly Jericho.

#### 2:1c

**So they went and entered the house of a prostitute named Rahab and stayed there.**

* Then they(dual) left the camp at Shittim. When they arrived at the city of Jericho, they entered the house of a prostitute to stay there. Her name was Rahab.
* So, the men went to Jericho. They stayed for the night at the house of a prostitute named Rahab.

**Then:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *Then* introduces the next event in time.

Here is another way to translate this conjunction:

> and

Translate this conjunction in a way that is natural to introduce the next event in the narrative.

**they went and entered the house of a prostitute named Rahab:** Rahab’s house was in Jericho. It may be clearer to make explicit that they arrived in Jericho.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> They went to Jericho and entered the house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab

**a prostitute named Rahab:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates literally as *prostitute* refers to someone who has sex with other people for money.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> a prostitute. Her name was Rahab.

**and stayed there:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *stayed there* means “to lie down (to sleep).” The men intended to spend the night there, but they had to flee, and they left during the night.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> they intended to stay there that night

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Then the men went to the town of Jericho. They entered the house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab. They planned to spend the night there.

> So the men arrived at Jericho, and stayed at the house of a prostitute named Rahab

## Joshua 2:2 (id: 515871)

### Section 2:1–24 Joshua sent men to explore Jericho secretly

Joshua sent two men to look at Jericho, a town in the land of Canaan. A woman of Jericho called Rahab hid the two men so that the king’s soldiers could not find them. She did this because she believed that Yahweh would help the Israelites conquer their land. The men promised Rahab that if she did not betray them, they would rescue her and her family when the Israelites conquered the town. Rahab helped the men escape from Jericho and they hid in the hills for three days. When the soldiers of Jericho stopped looking for them, they returned to Joshua.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The spies went to Jericho

> The spies and Rahab

> Rahab helped the spies

### Paragraph: 2:1–7

Joshua sent two spies to Jericho and they entered the house of Rahab. The king of Jericho sent soldiers to arrest them, but Rahab protected the two men. She hid the spies and told the soldiers that they had already left.

#### 2:2a

**And it was reported to the king of Jericho:**

* The king of Jericho received a report:
* While they were there, someone told the king of Jericho:

**And:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *And* introduces the next event in the story.

Here is another way to translate this conjunction:

> then

Translate this conjunction in a way that is natural to introduce the next event in the narrative.

**it was reported to the king of Jericho:** We do not know who told the king of Jericho.

Here are some other ways to translate this clause:

> somebody told the king of Jericho

> people told the king of Jericho

**the king of Jericho:** There were many towns in the land of Canaan at that time, and each town had its own king.

#### 2:2b

**“Behold, some men of Israel have come here tonight to spy out the land.”**

* “Listen, some Israelite men came here tonight to spy on this land.”
* “Tonight, men from Israel have come into Jericho. They have come to find out things about our land.”

**Behold:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Behold* introduces something that is surprising or unexpected. Some English versions do not translate this word. Some languages may have a grammatical marker which shows this information.

Here are some other ways to translate this word:

> look

> listen

> take note

**some men of Israel have come here tonight:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *some men of Israel* is more literally “men of the sons of Israel.”

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> some Israelite men have come to our town tonight

> men from Israel are in our town tonight

**to spy out the land:** The clause *to spy out the land* means that the men planned to explore the land to find out information about it.

**the land:** As in 2:1b, the men were spying on the land of Canaan. It may be helpful to say “our land” or “this land” to make it clear that Jericho was part of the land they referred to.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> to spy on our land

> They want to find out things about this land.

#### 2:3a

**So the king of Jericho sent to Rahab and said,**

* Then the king of Jericho sent some of his soldiers to Rahab.
* The king of Jericho sent men to Rahab,

**So:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *So* introduces the next event in the story line. Use a connection that is natural in your language.

**the king of Jericho:** In some languages it is not natural to repeat the phrase *the king of Jericho* as it has just been used in 2:2a. If this is true in your language, you could say “the king” or “he.”

**sent to Rahab:** In some languages it is clearer to make it explicit that the king sent some of his people. These are the same people who later searched for the spies along the road to the Jordan river. See 2:7a.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> So the king of Jericho sent soldiers/messengers to Rahab.

> Then the king sent some people to Rahab

**and said:** The words *and said* introduce the direct quotation that follows.

#### 2:3b

**“Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house,**

* They said to her: “Bring out the men who entered your house,
* saying: “Make the people who went into your house come out.

**Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house:** The clause *Bring out the men who came to you* indicates that Rahab must make the men come out of her house.

Here are some other ways to translate this direct quotation:

> Bring out the men who have come to you and gone into your house.

> Make the men who went into your house come out.

In some languages it may be more natural to use an indirect quotation.

> They told her to bring out the men who had entered her house.

#### 2:3c

**for they have come to spy out the whole land.”**

* because they have come to spy on all this land.”
* They have come here and intend to learn about all our land.”

**for:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *for* introduces the reason why Rahab should bring out the two men. She should hand them over because they had come to spy out the country.

**they have come to spy out the whole land:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *spy out* was also used in 2:2b. You should translate it in the same way in both places.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> because they have come to spy on our land

> because they have come to find out things about the land

##### **General Comment on verse 3b\-c**

In some languages it may be more natural to reorder parts 3b and 3c so that the reason for the command comes before the command itself. For example:

> The men in your house have come to spy out the whole country! Bring them out!” (GNT)

#### 2:4a

**But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them.**

* But Rahab already took the two men and hid them.
* Before the soldiers got there, Rahab helped the two men to hide.

**But:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *But* is usually used to indicate the next event in a narrative. However, Rahab hid the two men before the soldiers came to her.2:4 Boling and Wright, p 145–146; Woudstra, p. 70\. The BSB translates this conjunction as *But* to show that something unexpected happened. Choose a connecting word which sounds natural for this situation.

**the woman had taken the two men and hidden them:** The context of the story shows that Rahab hid the men before she spoke to the soldiers. English versions indicate this by using the pluperfect tense *had taken* them. Languages have various ways to indicate events that are not reported in order. Translate this clause in a way that is natural for events that are not reported in order.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> Before the soldiers arrived, the woman hid the two men

> The woman had already hidden the two men before she spoke to the king’s messengers

* Before the city gate was closed this evening, the men went out of the city.

**At dusk:** The phrase *At dusk* refers to the time when the sun had just set and the sky was becoming dark.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> at sundown (GNT)

> at dark (RSV)

**when the gate was about to close:** Jericho was a town surrounded by a wall. The word *gate* refers to the door in the wall through which people entered and left the town. It was closed at night to make the town more secure. The clause *when the gate was about to close* indicates that the gate was not yet closed.

**the men went out:** Rahab said that the men left through the town gate before it was closed for the night.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> The men went out of the town just before it was time to close the town gate.

> In the evening, when it was time to close the city gate, the men left (ERV)

* But I do not know where they went.
* They did not tell me where they were going.

* If you(plur) chase after them quickly, you may catch them.”
* Run after them quickly so that you can overtake them.”

**Pursue them quickly, and you may catch them:** The command *Pursue them quickly* indicates that the soldiers should hurry to follow the two Israelite men.

**and:** the Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *and* shows a result. If the men chase the Israelite spies, the result will be that they may catch up with them. In some languages it may be more natural to leave this conjunction untranslated. For example,

> Go after them quickly. You may catch up with them. (NIV)

**you may catch them:** There is an interpretation issue with the form of the Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *you may catch them*.

1. It is a possible event. For example:

    > you can overtake them (NRSV) *(BSB, NRSV, NIV, NKJV, NJPS, REB, GNT, CEV, NCV, NLT)*

2. It is a future event. For example:

    > you will catch up with them (GW) *(GW, RSV, NJB, NASB, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\) along with many English versions.

* But she had already taken the two Israelites up to the roof.
* However, earlier she took the two men up to the flat roof of her house.

**But:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *But* expresses a contrast between what Rahab said and what she had done. Use whatever word is natural in your language to show this contrast.

**Rahab had taken them up to the roof:** The clause *Rahab had taken them up to the roof* indicates that Rahab had already led the men to the roof before she spoke to the soldiers.

**up to the roof:** The phrase *up to the roof* refers to the roof of Rahab’s house. Houses in this area had flat roofs. It was possible for the men to be on the roof without falling off.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> But she had already led them up to the flat roof of her house

> Rahab said this, but really she had taken the men up to the roof (ERV)

#### 2:6b

**and hidden them among the stalks of flax that she had laid out there.)**

* She hid them under the stalks of flax which she laid out there.
* She hid them under the flax plants that were drying on the roof.

**and hidden them among the stalks of flax:** The clause *hidden them among the stalks of flax* indicates that Rahab hid the men underneath the stalks of flax.

**flax:** The word *flax* refers to a plant that grows in tall stalks. People use the fibers from the stalks to make thread. They weave this thread into linen cloth.

The type of stalks that Rahab used is not the important thing in this verse. In areas where flax is not known, a general word like “stalk” or “plant” may be used in the translation.

**that she had laid out there:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *laid out there* can also be translated “arrange” or “lay out.” Rahab laid out the flax stalks on the roof to dry.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> she had hidden them underneath the stalks of flax which she had laid out on the roof

**So the king’s men set out in pursuit of the spies along the road to the fords of the Jordan,**

* So, the men went after the Israelites along the road to the ford across the Jordan River.
* The soldiers searched for the Israelite men to the place where people could cross the Jordan River, but they did not find them.

**So:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *So* is used to emphasize that the focus is on the soldiers and what they did. It can also be translated “as for the men.” Some English versions leave this conjunction untranslated, for example:

> The king’s men pursued them (GW)

Choose a connection that is natural in your language.

**the king’s men set out in pursuit of the spies:** The Hebrew sentence that the BSB translates as *the king’s men set out in pursuit of the spies* does not follow the normal Hebrew word order. In Hebrew the verb usually comes first. In this sentence the subject comes first. This emphasizes the change of subject, from Rahab to the king’s soldiers.2:7 Williams p. 96 paragraph 573\.

**the king’s men:** The phrase *the king’s men* refers to the same men who came to Rahab’s house. These men were first mentioned in verse 2:3a. How you translate the phrase *the king’s men* will depend on the implied information that you supplied in that verse.

**set out in pursuit of the spies:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *set out in pursuit* can also be translated as “chased” or “looked for.”

**the spies:** The phrase *the spies* refers to the two Israelite men. The king’s men believed Rahab’s report that the Israelite men had already left Jericho.

**along the road to the fords of the Jordan:** The phrase *along the road to the fords of the Jordan* indicates the road that led to the Jordan River.

**the fords of the Jordan:** The *fords* are a place in a river where the water is shallow and people can walk across.

Here are some other ways to translate this word:

> crossing\-place

> the place where people can cross the river

It may be helpful to add the implicit information “but they did not find them.”

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> As for the king’s men, they chased after the Israelites until they reached the fords of the Jordan River

> The soldiers ran after the two Israelite men as far as the place where they could cross the Jordan River but they did not find them

#### 2:7b

**and as soon as they had gone out, the gate was shut.**

* As soon as the men went out of Jericho, the city gate was shut.
* Immediately after the soldiers left the city, the gatekeeper shut the city gate.

**and as soon as:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates *as soon as* is more literally “after when.” Verse 5a said that the men left just at the time when the gate was closed at dusk. The two actions happened quickly one after the other.

**they had gone out:** The pronoun *they* refers to the king’s men who chased the Israelites. The phrase *had gone out* indicates that these soldiers left Jericho.

**the gate was shut:** See the note on 2:5a.

##### **General Comment on 2:7**

The events in this verse are not told in order. In some languages it may be more natural to reorder this verse. For example:

She did this because she believed that Yahweh would help the Israelites conquer their land. The men promised Rahab that if she did not betray them, they would rescue her and her family when the Israelites conquered the town.

### Paragraph 2:8–11

Rahab told the spies that the news about the Israelites had made her people afraid. She believed that the God of Israel would help the Israelites to conquer the land.

#### 2:8

In this verse the storyline changes back to what the two Israelite spies did. This action takes place at approximately the same time as the action in the previous verse. While the soldiers were searching for the Israelite spies along the road to the Jordan River, the spies were getting ready to sleep on the roof of Rahab’s house.

#### 2:8a

**Before the spies lay down for the night,**

* ¶ As for the Israelite men, before they lay down to sleep,
* ¶ Meanwhile, before the two men went to sleep that night

**Before the spies lay down for the night:** The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as *Before the spies lay down* is more literally “and they, before they lay down.” The Hebrew conjunction together with the emphatic pronoun indicates a change of subject, from the king’s men back to the Israelite men. Some languages have a grammatical marker which indicates a change of subject.

**lay down for the night:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *lay down* indicates that the men were lying down to go to sleep.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> As for the Israelite men, before they lay down to sleep

> Meanwhile, before the two men went to sleep that night

#### 2:8b

**Rahab went up on the roof**

* Rahab went to them on the roof.
* Rahab went up on the roof to see them.

**Rahab went up on the roof:** The name *Rahab* refers to Rahab. In some languages it may be necessary to make this explicit.

* “I know that Yahweh has given our(excl) land to you(plur) Israelites.
* “I know that Yahweh is giving this land to you Israelite people.

**I know that the LORD has given you this land:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *has given* is in the perfect aspect. The perfect aspect expresses a completed action. Rahab said that the land already belonged to the Israelites, because Yahweh will give it to them. It is as if the action had already been done. Many English versions translate the Hebrew perfect aspect with a present perfect tense to show this. If this is not natural in your language, you can translate the verb using a future tense.

Here are some other ways to translate this clause:

> I know the Lord is handing this land over to you (NET)

> I know that Yahweh is giving you(plur) this land

> I know that Yahweh will give our land to you Israelites

**you:** The pronoun *you* is plural and refers to all the Israelites.

**this land:** The phrase *this land* refers to the land of Canaan.

#### 2:9c

**and that the fear of you has fallen on us,**

* You Israelites frighten us.
* We are very afraid of you.

**and that the fear of you has fallen on us:** The clause *the fear of you has fallen on us* is an idiom which means “we are afraid of you.”

**you:** The Hebrew pronoun that the BSB translates as *you* is plural. It refers to all the Israelite people, not only to the two spies.

**us:** The pronoun *us* refers to Rahab and the people of Jericho.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> and that we(excl) are very afraid of you(plur)

> Everyone in the country is terrified of you (GNT)

#### 2:9d

**so that all who dwell in the land are melting in fear of you.**

* In fact, all the inhabitants of this land tremble when they see you.
* All of us in the land are terrified of you.

**so that all who dwell in the land are melting in fear of you:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *melting* can also be translated “shake.” This is an idiom which means that the Canaanites were afraid of the Israelites. Many languages have idioms to express the idea of fear. These may be used here and in 2:9c.

**in fear of you:** The Hebrew words that the BSB translates as *in fear of you* indicate that the people of the land were afraid of the Israelites.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Everyone who lives in this country is terrified of you

> All the people of this land shake with fear because of you

##### **General Comment on 2:9c\-d**

In some languages it is not natural to use two parallel expressions as the Hebrew text does. If that is true in your language, you could combine these two phrases into one phrase that expresses strong fear, as the GNT does:

> Everyone in the country is terrified of you. (GNT)

## Joshua 2:10 (id: 515886)

### Section 2:1–24 Joshua sent men to explore Jericho secretly

Joshua sent two men to look at Jericho, a town in the land of Canaan. A woman of Jericho called Rahab hid the two men so that the king’s soldiers could not find them. She did this because she believed that Yahweh would help the Israelites conquer their land. The men promised Rahab that if she did not betray them, they would rescue her and her family when the Israelites conquered the town. Rahab helped the men escape from Jericho and they hid in the hills for three days. When the soldiers of Jericho stopped looking for them, they returned to Joshua.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The spies went to Jericho

> The spies and Rahab

> Rahab helped the spies

### Paragraph 2:8–11

Rahab told the spies that the news about the Israelites had made her people afraid. She believed that the God of Israel would help the Israelites to conquer the land.

#### 2:10a

**For we have heard how the LORD dried up the waters of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt,**

* We(excl) have heard how Yahweh dried up the water of the Red Sea in front of you(plur) and you crossed it to leave Egypt.
* We are frightened because we heard about how you left Egypt. We heard how Yahweh moved the water of the Red Sea to make a dry path for you.

**For:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *For* introduces the reason why the Canaanites were afraid of the Israelites. Use the appropriate connecting word in your language. It may be clearer to supply some implicit information. For example:

> We (excl) are afraid because

**we have heard how the LORD dried up the waters of the Red Sea before you:** The sentence *the LORD dried up the waters of the Red Sea before you* refers to events described in Exodus 14\. In some languages it may be necessary to make explicit why Yahweh dried up the Red Sea, that is, so that the Israelites could cross it. If it is necessary to make this explicit you could say:

> we have heard how Yahweh dried up the water of the Red Sea in front of you so that you could cross it

**Red Sea:** The Hebrew words that the BSB translates as Red Sea are literally “sea of reeds.” The translation *Red Sea* comes from the Septuagint translation into Greek. This body of water is not the same as what is known as the Red Sea today. If you use the term *Red Sea*, you should consider adding a footnote. For example:

> FOOTNOTE: The Hebrew phrase is literally “Sea of Reeds.” It refers to the lake that the Israelites had to cross when they left Egypt. See Exodus 14\.

The term *Red Sea* occurs several times in Exodus. See, for example, Exodus 10:19\.

**you:** The Hebrew inflection that the BSB translates as *you* is plural and refers to the people of Israel.

**when you came out of Egypt:** The whole story of what happened when the Israelites left Egypt is told in Exodus 12–14\.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> For we have heard how the Lord made a dry path for you through the Red Sea when you left Egypt (NLT)

> We are afraid because we heard that Yahweh made the Red Sea dry up in front of you so that you could cross it when you left Egypt

#### 2:10b

**and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amorites across the Jordan, whom you devoted to destruction.**

* And we have heard what you did to King Sihon and King Og, the two kings of the Amorites who lived on the other side of the Jordan River. You completely destroyed them.
* We have heard how you killed King Sihon and King Og, the two Amorite kings. They ruled east of the Jordan River.

**and what you did:** This is the middle of a long sentence. In some languages it may be helpful to start a new sentence here. For example:

> We have also heard what you did

**to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amorites:** The Amorites were nations on the east side of the Jordan River. The story of how the Israelites conquered their kings is told in Numbers 21:21–35\.

**to Sihon and Og:** *Sihon and Og* are the two kings of the Amorites.

**across the Jordan:** The phrase *across the Jordan* refers to the east side of the Jordan River.

**whom you devoted to destruction:** This phrase describes what the Israelites did to King Sihon and King Og.

**devoted to destruction:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *devoted to destruction* means that something was dedicated to Yahweh and could not be used. It must be destroyed or given to Yahweh as an offering. In this context it indicates that they killed the two Amorite kings. This event is described in Numbers 21:21–35 and is retold in Deuteronomy 2:24–3:11\.

Here are some other ways to translate this verb:

> completely destroyed

> killed

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> We heard what you did when you killed King Sihon and King Og, the two Amorite kings who ruled east of the Jordan River

> We know what you did to Sihon and Og, the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River. You destroyed them.

#### 2:11a

**When we heard this,**

* When we(excl) heard it
* We heard about that

**When we heard this:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates *When we heard this* is more literally “and we heard.”

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> When we heard that news

> We heard about that

#### 2:11b

**our hearts melted**

* our hearts shook with fear.
* and we were terribly afraid.

**our hearts melted:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *melted* is a different verb from the one used in verse 2:9d. It can also be translated “dissolve.” This is a Hebrew idiom. It means that they were very afraid.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Our hearts shook with fear

> We were very afraid

#### 2:11c

**and everyone’s courage failed because of you,**

* Everyone lost courage because of you(plur).
* None of us was brave at all, because we were frightened of you.

**and everyone’s courage failed:** The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as *everyone’s courage failed* is more literally “there no longer arose breath in a man.” It is a Hebrew idiom. It means that they were very afraid of the Israelites.

In some languages it is not possible to use two phrases with such similar meanings. If this is true in your language, you could combine 2:11b\-c and say, “we were very afraid.”

**because of you:** The phrase *because of you* indicates the reason for the fear. The people of Canaan were very afraid of the Israelites.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> There was no spirit left in us on account of what we had heard about you.

> Everyone’s courage disappeared because of what you had done.

#### 2:11d

**for the LORD your God is God in the heavens above and on the earth below.**

* Because it is Yahweh your(plur) God who is God in heaven above and on earth below.
* For Yahweh, your God, is the only God. He rules in heaven and on earth.

**for:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *for* introduces the reason why the Canaanites were frightened. They were frightened because of Yahweh.

**the LORD your God:** The Hebrew uses the name of God, Yahweh. The phrase *your God* indicates that he was the God of the Israelites.

**is God in the heavens above and on the earth below:** The Hebrew sentence is more literally “for Yahweh your God, he is God in the heavens above and on the earth beneath.” The pronoun “he” emphasizes that it is Yahweh alone who is God over both heaven and earth. Use a natural way to show this emphasis.

**in the heavens above:** In some languages it will not be natural to say both *in the heavens* and *above*. If this is so in your language, you can say “in heaven.”

**on the earth below:** If it is not natural to translate both *on the earth* and *below*, you can translate this as “on earth.”

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> because it is Yahweh your God who is God and rules over heaven and the earth

> Yahweh your God is the only God. He rules over heaven above and over the earth below

She did this because she believed that Yahweh would help the Israelites conquer their land. The men promised Rahab that if she did not betray them, they would rescue her and her family when the Israelites conquered the town.

### Paragraph 2:12–14

Rahab asked the spies to spare her and her family. The spies promised to do this if she helped them escape.

#### 2:12a

**Now therefore, please swear to me by the LORD**

* ¶ So now swear(dual) an oath to me in the name of Yahweh.
* ¶ Therefore promise me, and ask Yahweh to punish you if you do not keep this promise.

**Now therefore:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Now therefore* can also be translated “so” or “then.” It shows that Rahab’s request was urgent. It is not a time word.2:12 Bratcher p. 30\. Choose an appropriate way to express this in your language.

**please swear to me:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *swear* can also be translated “promise.” It is used here in the sense of taking an oath. This verb is also used in 1:6c where God is the one who swore. In this verse the two Israelite men are the ones who swear.

Here are some other ways to translate this word:

> promise(dual)

> make an oath

> pledge

**by the LORD:** The phrase *by the LORD* indicates that the person makes an oath or promise in the name of Yahweh. He says that he expects Yahweh to punish him if he does not keep his promise.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> So now take an oath in the name of Yahweh

> Therefore, promise me by the name of Yahweh

> So, promise me, and may Yahweh punish you if you do not keep the promise.

#### 2:12b

**that you will indeed show kindness to my family,**

* you will show kindness to the family of my father.
* Now you must be faithful to me and my whole family.

**you will indeed show kindness:** The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as *you will indeed show kindness* is more literally “and you will do, also you, *ḥesed*.” The emphatic pronoun emphasizes that the Israelites should show loyalty to her as she has done to them. Use a term or grammatical marker that is natural to show this emphasis in your language.

The expression *show kindness* uses the same Hebrew word *ḥesed* as in 12c. You should translate it the same way in both places.

**to my family:** The phrase *to my family* refers to Rahab and her family.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> you in turn will show loyalty to my family (NJPS)

> You yourselves will also treat my family kindly

> You will act as faithfully to my family as I have acted faithfully to you

#### 2:12c

**because I showed kindness to you.**

* Swear that because I have shown kindness to you.
* I have been faithful to you.

**because I showed kindness to you:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *I showed kindness to you* is more literally “I have done *ḥesed* with you.” The Hebrew word *ḥesed* is a key biblical term. It means that one is loyal to a covenant relationship. It includes the meanings of faithfulness and loyalty. Consider what is the most appropriate word in your language in this context.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Since I have shown loyalty to you (NJPS)

> Because I have treated you kindly

> Because I have acted faithfully with you

#### 2:12d

**Give me a sure sign**

* Give me a sign that I can trust.
* Do something so that I may be sure that you will do what you have promised.

**Give me a sure sign:** The Hebrew expression that the BSB translates as *a sure sign* is more literally “a sign of faithfulness.”

Here are some ways to translate this expression:

> give me a sign that I can trust

> do something so that I can be certain that you will do what you promised

**that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them,**

* I want to know that you(dual) will allow me to live, with my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and their families.
* Save the lives of my family and my parents, and the families of my brothers and sisters.

**that you will spare the lives:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *spare the lives* can also be translated “let live.” Rahab asked the two Israelites to promise that no one would kill her family when the Israelites conquered Jericho.

**of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them:** The phrase *all who belong to them* indicates the families of Rahab’s brothers and sisters as well as her own immediate family.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Let my father and mother, my brothers and sisters and all their families live

> Save the lives of my whole family

#### 2:13b

**and that you will deliver us from death.”**

* Do not let anyone kill us(excl).”
* Do not kill us.”

**and that you will deliver us from death:** Rahab asked the Israelites not to kill her or her family. Rahab makes the same request two times, using different words, to emphasize the importance of her request.

**“Our lives for your lives!”**

* “We(dual)(excl) offer our own lives as a guarantee for your lives,”
* “We will give up our lives to protect your lives,”

The Hebrew conjunction that some English versions translate as “And” indicates the next event in the story. Use a connecting word that is natural in your language to indicate this. Some English versions, like the BSB, do not translate this connecting word.

**Our lives for your lives:** The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as *Our lives for your lives* is more literally “Our lives instead of you(plur) to die.” The two spies promised to protect Rahab and her family even if it means that they must die themselves.2:14 Dallaire p. 869; Woudstra p. 74\.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> We offer our own lives as a guarantee for your safety (NLT)

* the men said:
* the two men answered her.

**the men agreed:** Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> The men told her

#### 2:14c

**“If you do not report our mission,**

* “But you(plur) must not talk about our plans to anyone.
* “But you must not tell anyone what we have been doing.

**If:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *If* introduces the condition on which the Israelites will keep Rahab’s family safe.

**you do not report:** The Hebrew inflection that the BSB translates as *you* is second person plural. It refers to Rahab and her family.

**our mission:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *mission* can refer to any kind of matter or happening. In this context it refers to the men’s exploring the land so that the Israelites could attack it.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> If you do not tell anyone what we have been doing (GNT)

> If you do not tell anyone about this matter of ours

#### 2:14d

**we will show you kindness and faithfulness when the LORD gives us the land.”**

* If you do that, we will treat you(sing) with kindness and faithfulness when Yahweh gives us this land.”
* Then we will be loyal and true to you when Yahweh helps us take this land.”

This verse part starts with a Hebrew conjunction that the BSB leaves untranslated. This conjunction introduces result. It explains what the men promised to do if Rahab did what they asked her to do. (They asked her not to tell anybody about them). One way to translate this transition would be as the RSV does:

> Then (RSV)

**we will show you kindness and faithfulness:** The Hebrew sentence that the BSB translates as *we will show you kindness and faithfulness* is more literally, “we will do with you loyalty and faithfulness.” This phrase describes acts that are done because people have made a covenant, or agreement, between each other. For example, it is used in Genesis 24:27\.2:14 Woudstra p. 74\.

The term *kindness* translates the Hebrew word *ḥesed* that was used in verse 2:12 (12b and 12c). You should translate it the same way in each place. The term *faithfulness* indicates that the two men would be trustworthy in their relationship with Rahab.

**you:** The pronoun *you* is singular. The men referred only to Rahab.

**when the LORD gives us the land:** The clause *when the LORD gives us the land* refers to the time when Yahweh will help the Israelites to conquer the land of Canaan.

Here are some other ways to translates this part of the verse:

> Then we(excl) will act with kindness and faithfulness towards you(sing) when Yahweh gives us this land.

> We will be loyal and true to you when Yahweh helps us to take over the land.

**Then Rahab let them down by a rope through the window,**

* ¶ Then she lowered them from the window with a rope.
* ¶ Then she put a rope through the window and the two men climbed down the rope to the ground.

**Then:** The Hebrew connector that the BSB translates as *Then* indicates the next event in the story. Choose a connecting word that is appropriate in your language.

**Rahab let them down by a rope through the window:** The sentence *Rahab let them down by a rope through the window* indicates that Rahab tied a rope to the outer window of her house. The two men climbed down the rope to the ground.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> She lowered the two men by a rope through her window

> Then she put a rope through the window and they climbed down the rope

#### 2:15b

**since the house where she lived was built into the wall of the city.**

* This was possible because her house was built into the city wall, so that she lived within its walls.
* She could do this because she lived in a house that was built as part of the wall around the city.

**since:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *since* introduces an explanation of why Rahab was able to help the spies escape. She could help them because her house was built into the town wall. Her window opened onto the area outside the town.

**the house where she lived was built into the wall of the city:** The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as *the house where she lived was built into the wall of the city* is more literally “her house was in the wall of the town wall.” It indicates that one of the walls of Rahab’s house formed a part of the wall that surrounded the town.

**the house…was built into the wall of the city:** Archaeological research shows that at one time Jericho had two town walls. There was a space between the walls and people could build their houses using the two walls.2:15 Boling and Wright, p. 148\. The sentence *the house …was built into the wall of the city* indicates that Rahab’s house was built between the inner and outer town wall.

A literal translation of *the house where she lived was built into the wall of the city* may not make any sense in many languages. It may be necessary to combine the two clauses in this part of the verse.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> she lived in a house that was a part of the town wall

> the house where she lived was built using the town wall

##### **General Comment on 2:15**

In some languages it may be clearer to describe Rahab’s house first, and then say that she lowered the spies down. For example,

> Her house was built as part of the town wall, so she let them down by a rope through the window.

**she said,**

* she said to them before the men went down,
* she told them as they were leaving.

#### 2:16a\-b

The Hebrew conjunction commonly translated as “and” (which the BSB does not translate here) usually indicates the next consecutive action in the story. However, the events portrayed in verses 16–21 are not presented in chronological order.2:16 Hess, p. 102; Coleson, p. 51; Bratcher, p. 33\. It is likely that Rahab spoke to the men before they went through the window.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Rahab told them

> Before they went down she said to the men

**Go to the hill country:** There were not very many people living in these hills, so it would be a good place for the spies to hide.

**hill country:** In English we distinguish between low hills, and high hills which we call “mountains.” Hebrew has only one word that refers to both hills and mountains. The high places west of Jericho that the BSB refers to as *hill country* were up to about 600 meters high. Choose a word in your language that is appropriate for hills of this height.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Go to the mountains

> Go up to the hilly places

#### 2:16c

**“so that your pursuers will not find you.**

* “so that the people who chase you cannot find you.
* “Do not let them catch you.

**your pursuers will not find you:** See the note on “set out in pursuit” in 2:7a.

Here is another way to translate the word *pursuers*:

> the men who are looking for you

**will not find you:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *find* can also be translated “encounter,” or “happen upon.”

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> so that the people looking for you will not find you

> so that the king’s men who chase after you will not catch you

**The men said to her,**

* The men said to her:
* And the men told her:

**The men said to her:** The Hebrew has a word that the BSB does not translate. It indicates that this is the next event in the storyline.

#### 2:17b

**“We will not be bound by this oath you made us swear**

* “We(dual)(excl) will be free from keeping the promise that you(sing) asked us to give if you don’t do these things.
* “If you do not do what we say we will be released from the oath you made us take.

**We will not be bound by this oath:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *not…bound* can also be translated “free,” “innocent,” or “exempt from.” The men told Rahab the conditions on which they would keep the promise they had made. If Rahab did not follow what they said in verses 18–20, they would not have to keep their promise to protect her.

**this oath:** The phrase *this oath* refers to the promise that the two spies made in 2:14 to protect Rahab and her family.

**you made us swear:** The clause *you made us swear* refers to Rahab’s action in verse 2:12\. She asked the men to promise that they would keep her family safe.

There is some implied information. The condition on which the Israelites will be released from their promise is missing.

For example:

> We will be bound by the oath we have taken only if you follow these instructions (NLT)

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> we(excl) will be free from keeping the promise that you asked us to give if you do not do this

> if you do not do what we say we will be released from the oath we have taken

## Joshua 2:18 (id: 515900)

### Section 2:1–24 Joshua sent men to explore Jericho secretly

Joshua sent two men to look at Jericho, a town in the land of Canaan. A woman of Jericho called Rahab hid the two men so that the king’s soldiers could not find them. She did this because she believed that Yahweh would help the Israelites conquer their land. The men promised Rahab that if she did not betray them, they would rescue her and her family when the Israelites conquered the town. Rahab helped the men escape from Jericho and they hid in the hills for three days. When the soldiers of Jericho stopped looking for them, they returned to Joshua.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The spies went to Jericho

> The spies and Rahab

> Rahab helped the spies

### Paragraph 2:15–21

Rahab helped the spies escape. Before they left, they explained what she must do so that they can save her and her family.

#### 2:18a

**unless, when we enter the land,**

* When we(plur)(excl) come back to this land,
* When our people come to invade your land,

The Hebrew word that begins this verse is usually translated as “Behold” and calls attention to the next statement. Languages have a variety of ways to direct the listener’s attention to the next statement. Some languages may have a word that has this function. In other languages it may be better to use a sentence. For example:

> This is what you must do. (GNT)

In some English versions, including the BSB, this Hebrew word is omitted, but the implicit information from verse 17b is included here instead. For example:

> unless you do what we say (NIRV)

**when we enter the land:** The spies spoke about the time when they will return with their army to invade the land. You may need to make this explicit, for example:

> when our(excl) people come to invade the land

**the land:** The phrase *the land* indicates the land of Canaan where Jericho was. If this is not clear you can say:

> this land

> your land

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> when we attack this land

> when we Israelites invade your land

#### 2:18b

**you have tied this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down,**

* tie(sing) this red rope to the window where you are letting us down.
* you must tie this red rope in the window. Tie it so that we can see it in the window you let us down from.

**you have tied this scarlet cord:** The clause *you have tied this scarlet cord* is a command. It indicates that Rahab must tie a length of red cord, or rope, to the window.

It is not clear whether the men gave Rahab the rope, or whether it was a rope that Rahab already had in her house.2:18 Hess, p. 103–104; Bratcher, p. 34\.

**scarlet:** The term *scarlet* is another word for red.

**in the window through which you let us down:** The clause *in the window through which you let us down* indicates that Rahab must tie the red rope so that it can be seen in the window that the men climb through.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> you must tie this red rope so that we can see it in the window where you let us down

> tie this red rope in the window that you let us down from

#### 2:18c

**and unless you have brought your father and mother and brothers and all your family into your house.**

* Then assemble your(sing) father, your mother, your brothers, and all your father’s family into your house.
* You must bring your father, your mother, your brothers, and everyone in your father’s family into the house with you.

**and unless you have brought your father and mother and brothers and all your family into your house:** The BSB has reversed the order of the parts of the Hebrew sentence. The Hebrew is more literally, “and your father and your mother and your brothers and all the house of your father you shall gather to you, to the house.” This is a way of emphasizing the members of Rahab’s family.

In verse 13a, the phrase “my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them” is used. In this verse Rahab’s sisters are not mentioned. However, this does not mean that they are no longer included. If this is likely to be misunderstood, you may wish to include the word “sisters” in this verse.

**all your family:** The phrase *all your family* refers to Rahab’s family, including her brothers and sisters and their families. In verse 13a this group of people was referred to as “all who belong to them.”

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> You must bring your father, your mother, your brothers and all who belong to your father’s household into the house with you

> All your family members must come inside the house with you. Bring your father, your mother, your brothers, and all your relatives.

### Section 2:1–24 Joshua sent men to explore Jericho secretly

Joshua sent two men to look at Jericho, a town in the land of Canaan. A woman of Jericho called Rahab hid the two men so that the king’s soldiers could not find them. She did this because she believed that Yahweh would help the Israelites conquer their land. The men promised Rahab that if she did not betray them, they would rescue her and her family when the Israelites conquered the town.

> The spies went to Jericho

> The spies and Rahab

> Rahab helped the spies

### Paragraph 2:15–21

Rahab helped the spies escape. Before they left, they explained what she must do so that they can save her and her family.

#### 2:19a

**If anyone goes out the door of your house into the street,**

* If anyone goes outside the doors of your(sing) house,
* If anyone leaves your house and goes outside,

**If anyone goes out the door of your house:** The clause *If anyone goes out the door of your house* indicates that Rahab’s family must stay inside the house and not leave it. In some languages it may be more natural to omit the phrase *the door*.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> If any of them go outside your house (NIV)

**into the street:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *into the street* is more literally “outside.” If your translation of “out the door of your house” already contains the meaning “outside” you may not need to repeat it.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> If any of them goes outside the house

> Anyone who leaves your house (NET)

#### 2:19b

**his blood will be on his own head, and we will be innocent.**

* his death will be his own responsibility. We will be innocent of his death.
* it will be his own fault if he gets killed. We will not be responsible for what happens.

**his blood will be on his own head:** This is an idiom. It means “his death will be his fault.” The spies said that if any of Rahab’s family does not obey their instructions, it will be that person’s fault when they die. It will not be the fault of the spies.

**his blood:** The term *blood* is a figure of speech. It refers to death. The pronoun *his* is masculine but in this context it refers to every member of Rahab’s family, the women as well as the men.

**and we will be innocent:** The term *innocent* is the same Hebrew word that was used in verse 17b (translated in the BSB as “not…bound”). If it is possible you should use the same term here as in verse 17b. If it is not natural to use the same term, here are some other ways to translate it:

> we will be innocent of his death

> we will not be responsible for his death

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> he will be responsible for his own death, and we will be innocent

> If he dies it will be his own fault. We will not be guilty

#### 2:19c

**But if a hand is laid on anyone with you in the house,**

* However, if our people harm anyone who is indoors with you,
* But, if anyone who remains with you in the house gets hurt,

**But:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *But* introduces a contrast.2:19 Williams, p, 71 paragraph 433\. Verse 19a\-b explains what will happen to someone who leaves Rahab’s house. Verse 19c\-d explains what will happen to someone who stays in the house. Use a connecting word in your language that indicates this contrast.

**if a hand is laid on anyone with you in the house:** The Hebrew idiom that the BSB translates as *a hand is laid on* indicates that someone gets hurt.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> But if any one inside the house gets hurt

> But if someone harms one of your family inside the house

#### 2:19d

**his blood will be on our heads.**

* his death will be our responsibility.
* we will be responsible.

**his blood will be on our heads:** This indicates that the two spies will be responsible if Rahab’s family dies. See the notes on verse 19b.

### Section 2:1–24 Joshua sent men to explore Jericho secretly

Joshua sent two men to look at Jericho, a town in the land of Canaan. A woman of Jericho called Rahab hid the two men so that the king’s soldiers could not find them. She did this because she believed that Yahweh would help the Israelites conquer their land. The men promised Rahab that if she did not betray them, they would rescue her and her family when the Israelites conquered the town.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The spies went to Jericho

> The spies and Rahab

> Rahab helped the spies

### Paragraph 2:15–21

Rahab helped the spies escape. Before they left, they explained what she must do so that they can save her and her family.

#### 2:20a

**And if you report our mission,**

* But if you(sing) talk about our(dual)(excl) matter to anybody,
* But if you tell anyone what we have been doing,

**And:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *And* introduces a contrast, so many English version translate it as “But.” In verse 14c the Israelite spies gave the condition on which they will save the lives of Rahab and her family. In this verse they give the condition on which they will not save them. Use a word or a grammar marker which expresses this contrast in your language.

**if you report our mission:** The phrase *if you report our mission* uses the same Hebrew words that occurred in 2:14c except that the word “not” is not included. Translate this positive phrase the same way as you did in that verse, without using the negative.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> However, if you tell anyone what we have been doing (GNT)

> but if you tell anyone about this matter of ours

#### 2:20b

**we will be released from the oath you made us swear.”**

* we will be released from the oath you have made us take.”
* then we will be free from the promise which you asked us to make.”

The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB leaves untranslated introduces what will happen if Rahab tells people about them. In some languages it may be more natural to keep this word explicit by using a word like “then.”

**we will be released from the oath you made us swear:** This Hebrew phrase is the same as the phrase in verse 17b, except for one word. In verse 17b there is the emphatic pronoun “we.” In this verse the verb “we will be” occurs instead. The meaning is the same.

In both these verses the men give conditions on which they will not keep their promise. In the previous verse, they will not keep their promise if Rahab does not tie the red rope in the window. In this verse they will not keep their promise if Rahab tells anyone about what they were doing.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> we(dual)(excl) will be free from keeping the promise that you(sing) asked us to give

> we will be released from the oath you made us take

* Then she said goodbye to them and they went down the rope and left.

**and:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *and* indicates the next event in the story line.

**she sent them away:** The clause *she sent them away* indicates that Rahab told the men to go.

Here are some other ways to translate this clause:

> she said goodbye to them

**So the spies went out into the hill country**

* ¶ They left Jericho and they went up into the hills.
* ¶ When the spies left, they went to hide in the hills.

**So the spies went out:** The clause *the spies went out* repeats information from verse 21c. It refers to the same event.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> When the two Israelites departed

> After they left

**into the hill country:** The Israelite men followed the advice that Rahab gave them. They went to the hills that were west of the town of Jericho.

**the hill country:** See note on “hill country” at verse 2:16a.

#### 2:22c

**until their pursuers had returned without finding them,**

* until the men who were looking for them went back to Jericho.
* until the soldiers gave up searching and returned home.

**until their pursuers had returned:** See the note on “set out in pursuit” in 2:7a. In some languages it is awkward to use a long phrase like “the men who were looking for them.” If this is the case in your language you can use some other phrase such as “the soldiers.” Be sure that your readers know that these are the people referred to in verse 16c.

**had returned:** The verb *returned* indicates that the pursuers went back to Jericho. In some languages it will be necessary to make that explicit.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> until the people who were looking for them had returned to Jericho

> They waited until the soldiers had gone back to Jericho

**without finding them:** The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as *without finding them* is more literally “but not they found.” It means that the king’s soldiers did not find them.

#### 2:22d

**having searched all along the road.**

* Those people looked for them all along the road but did not find them.
* The soldiers looked for them on every road. But they did not find them.

**having searched all along the road:** The phrase *searched all along the road* means they searched for the two spies all along the roads that led back to the Jordan River.

The spies stayed in the hills for three days and then they returned to Joshua.

#### 2:23a

**Then the two men started back, came down from the hill country,**

* Then those two men came down from the hills.
* After three days, they came down from the hills where they hid

**Then:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *Then* indicates the next event in the story.

**the two men started back, came down from the hill country:** The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as *the two men started back, came down from the hill country* is more literally “and the two men returned, and they came down from the hills.” The phrase *the two men* refers to the Israelite spies.

**from the hill country:** It may be helpful to include the implicit information “where they were hiding.” For example:

> they came down from the mountains where they hid

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Then the two Israelite men came back down from the hilly country

> Then the two spies went down from the hills where they had been hiding

#### 2:23b

**and crossed the river.**

* They crossed the Jordan River,
* and crossed the river.

**and crossed the river:** That Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *crossed the river* can also be translated “crossed.” On their way back to Joshua, the men had to cross the Jordan River. You may need to make the term Jordan River explicit in your translation.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> and they crossed the Jordan River

> they crossed the river

#### 2:23c

**So they came to Joshua son of Nun**

* and went back to Joshua the son of Nun at the camp.
* They returned to the camp and went to see Joshua the son of Nun.

**So they came to Joshua son of Nun:** See the note about Joshua at verse 1:1b. It may be helpful to supply implicit information about the location.

* Then they told Joshua about all that happened to them.
* They told him everything that they learned.

**and reported all that had happened to them:** The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as *all that had happened to them* is more literally “all the things finding them.” This is a Hebrew idiom. It means “everything that had happened to them.” The word *happened* is an older way to say “happen.”

**“The LORD has surely delivered the entire land into our hands,”**

* “Certainly, Yahweh has given the whole land to us(incl).”
* “It is true, Yahweh will give us the entire land.”

The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB leaves untranslated but many English versions translate as “and” indicates the next event in the story.

In this part of the verse the two Israelite men use similar words to those that Rahab did in verse 2:9\.

**The LORD has surely delivered:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *has…delivered* is in the perfect aspect. The perfect aspect expresses a completed action. They said that the land already belongs to the Israelites because Yahweh will give it to them. It is as if the action has already been done. The BSB translates the Hebrew perfect aspect with an English present perfect tense. If this is not natural in your language, you can translate the verb as a future tense. For example:

> Yahweh will certainly hand over all this land to us

**surely:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *surely* indicates an emphatic assertion.

**the entire land:** The phrase *the entire land* refers to the entire land of Canaan.

**into our hands:** The phrase *into our hands* is a figure of speech. The words *our hands* indicates that the land will be under the control of the Israelites.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Yahweh has indeed given us power over all this land

> Yahweh will certainly give us this land

#### 2:24b

**“Indeed, all who dwell in the land are melting in fear of us.”**

* "All the people of the land tremble when they see us.”
* "Indeed, everyone who lives in that land is terrified of us.”

**Indeed:** The Hebrew adverb that the BSB translates as *Indeed* is used for emphasis.

Here are some other ways to translate this Hebrew adverb:

> and also (ESV)

> for (NLT)

Some English versions leave this adverb untranslated. For example:

> all the people are melting in fear because of us (NIV)

**all who dwell in the land:** The phrase *all who dwell in the land* refers to the people who live in the land of Canaan.

**are melting in fear:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *are melting in fear* is the same Hebrew verb used in 2:9d. If possible, you should use the same expression here as you did there.

**of us:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *of us* is more literally “from before us.” It indicates that the people of Canaan were afraid of the Israelites.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Indeed, everyone who lives in this country is terrified of us.

> All the people of this land even shake with fear because of us.

## Joshua 3:1 (id: 515914)

### Section 3:1–17 The Israelites crossed the Jordan River

The Israelites waited three days beside the Jordan and then crossed the river. The priests carried the ark and led the way. As soon as the priests stepped into the river, the water stopped flowing, and everyone was able to cross the river on dry ground.

### Paragraph 3:1–4

The Israelites left Shittim to go near the Jordan River, and set up camp there. Three days later they received instructions to set out and follow the ark, which was carried by the priests.

#### 3:1a

**Early the next morning Joshua got up and left Shittim with all the Israelites.**

* ¶ The next day, early in the morning, Joshua and all the Israelites got up and left from Shittim where they had set up their tents.
* ¶ Early the next morning Joshua left Shittim. All the Israelites packed up their camp and went with him.

This is the beginning of a new story. It takes place the day after the spies returned from their trip to Jericho.3:1 Woudstra p. 79\. In some languages it may be natural to start this new story with a phrase that sets the time, such as:

> Early the next morning

> The next day

Start this new episode in a way that is natural in your language.

**Early the next morning Joshua got up:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Early the next morning…got up* can also be translated as “make an early start” or “leave early in the morning.”

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> The next morning Joshua got up early to leave

> The next day Joshua left early in the morning

**and:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *and* indicates the next action in the story.

**left Shittim with all the Israelites:** The subject of the verb *left* is plural. It refers to all the Israelites. This is a characteristic of Hebrew narrative style. The first verb “rose” refers to Joshua and highlights his importance. The second verb “set out” indicates that all the Israelites participated in the action.

All the Israelites got up early and left along with Joshua. Some languages may need to make this clear.

Here is another way to translate this sentence:

> Joshua and all the people of Israel got up early in the morning and set out

**Shittim:** The term *Shittim* refers to the camping place that was mentioned in verse 2:1a. Translate it the same way you did there.

**with all the Israelites:** The BSB has moved the phrase *with all the Israelites* to this part of the verse because it makes more sense in English. In the Hebrew text this phrase is in verse 3:1b.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Joshua and all the people of Israel got up early in the morning to leave the camp. They set out from Shittim

> The next day Joshua and all the Israelites got ready early and left Shittim Campground.

#### 3:1b

**They went as far as the Jordan,**

* They came to the Jordan River,
* After leaving Shittim, they went to the Jordan River,

The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB leaves untranslated but many English versions translate as “and” indicates the next event in the story.

**went as far as the Jordan:** The clause *went as far as the Jordan* indicates that Joshua and all the Israelites traveled to the Jordan River, which was approximately seven miles to the west.3:1 Dallaire p. 877\.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> and arrived at the Jordan River

> They went west to the Jordan River

#### 3:1c

**where they camped**

* and they stayed there
* and they set up their tents there for three days

**where they camped:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *camped* means that they set up their tents and stayed near the Jordan River. In v. 2 it says that they stayed there for three days. In some languages it may be more natural to repeat that as implied information in this verse.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> and they camped there

> and they stayed near the Jordan River for three days

#### 3:1d

**before crossing over.**

* before they crossed the river.
* while they waited to cross the river.

**before crossing over:** Here is another way to translate this part of the verse:

## Joshua 3:2 (id: 515916)

### Section 3:1–17 The Israelites crossed the Jordan River

The Israelites waited three days beside the Jordan and then crossed the river. The priests carried the ark and led the way. As soon as the priests stepped into the river, the water stopped flowing, and everyone was able to cross the river on dry ground.

### Paragraph 3:1–4

The Israelites left Shittim to go near the Jordan River, and set up camp there. Three days later they received instructions to set out and follow the ark, which was carried by the priests.

#### 3:2

**After three days the officers went through the camp**

* After three days the leaders went through the camp
* After they stayed there two nights, the leaders of the clans of Israel went to everybody in the camp.

**After three days:** The Israelites counted days inclusively. The three days included the day that they arrived there.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> After two nights

> After three days had passed

**the officers:** The term *officers* refers to the leaders of each Israelite tribe. See how you translated this term in 1:10\.

Here are some other ways to translate this termː

> the leaders of the tribes of Israel

**went through the camp:** The clause went through the camp indicates that the leaders walked through the camp to communicate with all the people.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse

> After three days, the officers walked around the camp

> After two nights, the leaders of the Israel tribes went to everybody in the camp

### Paragraph 3:1–4

The Israelites left Shittim to go near the Jordan River, and set up camp there. Three days later they received instructions to set out and follow the ark, which was carried by the priests.

#### 3:3a

**and commanded the people:**

* and told the people:
* They gave this order to the people:

**and:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *and* indicates the next event in the story.

**commanded the people:** Here is another way to translate this part of the verse:

> they told the people

#### 3:3b

**“When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God being carried by the Levitical priests,**

* “When you(plur) see the Levitical priests carrying the covenant box of Yahweh your God,
* “You will see the holy chest which shows that Yahweh our God is with us. The priests of the Levi clan will carry it ahead of us.

**When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *ark* refers to a “box” or a “chest.”

The *ark of the covenant* was a box made of acacia wood and covered with gold (see Exodus 25:10–22\). Inside the box were the stone tablets on which the Ten Commandments were written. It also contained a pot of manna and Aaron’s walking stick. On top of it were two gold winged creatures called “cherubim.” The box reminded the Israelites of the covenant that Yahweh made with them. It was a sign that Yahweh promised to be with them. When you translate this term, choose a short phrase that describes the box or explains its purpose.

If you have translated the New Testament, see how you translated *ark of the covenant* in Hebrews 9:4 or Revelation 11:19\.

Here are some ways to translate this term:

> covenant box

> holy chest

> box of God’s covenant

> golden box

**the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God:** Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> the covenant box which shows that Yahweh your God is with you

**covenant:** A *covenant* is a formal agreement between two groups of people. God made a covenant with the people of Israel in which God and the people promised to be faithful to each other. See Genesis 17:1–21\.

Here are some other ways to translate this term:

> agreement

> promise

**of the LORD your God:** The phrase *the LORD your God* was used in Joshua 1:9c. See how you translated the phrase in that verse.

**your God:** Joshua was one of the Israelite people. In some languages it may be more natural to say:

> Yahweh our God

**being carried by the Levitical priests:** Four priests worked together to carry the covenant box on poles that rested on their shoulders. If your language has several verbs for “carry” you should choose an appropriate one.

Here is another way to translate this clause:

> which the Levitical priests carried on poles over their shoulders

**Levitical priests:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *Levitical priests* is literally “the priests, the Levites.” The priests were descendants of Levi and belonged to the tribe of Levi. All the priests were Levites.

Here are some other ways to translate this term:

> the priests, the Levites

> the priests of the Levi tribe

If this implies that there are some priests who are not of the Levi tribe, it is possible to say “the priests” and put a literal translation in a footnote.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> When you see the covenant box of Yahweh your God that the priests of the Levi tribe are carrying

> You will see the Levites, the priests, carrying the golden box of Yahweh your God

**priests:** The *priests* were people who offered sacrifices to God on behalf of the people. You should translate this term in the same way as in the New Testament. See, for example, Mark 1:44\.

#### 3:3c

**you are to set out from your positions and follow it.**

* set out from where you are and follow it.
* Then you should leave the place where you are camping and follow it.

The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB leaves untranslated but many English versions translate as “then” indicates the next thing that the Israelites must do.

**you are to set out from your positions:** The clause *you are to set out from your positions* is a command. The officers told the people to leave the place where they were camping, and to start walking.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> leave the place where you are camped

**and follow it:** The pronoun it refers to the covenant box.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> and go behind the covenant box

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Then you must start to walk from your camp and go behind it

> Then you should leave your camping place and follow the covenant box

##### **General Comment on 3:3b\-c**

The Hebrew sentence gives prominence to the covenant box, not to the priests. The people were told to follow the covenant box. If possible, translate this sentence in a way that gives prominence to the covenant box. For example:

> When you see the covenant box and the priests who are carrying it, then you should follow the covenant box

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:3

## Joshua 3:4 (id: 515919)

### Section 3:1–17 The Israelites crossed the Jordan River

The Israelites waited three days beside the Jordan and then crossed the river. The priests carried the ark and led the way. As soon as the priests stepped into the river, the water stopped flowing, and everyone was able to cross the river on dry ground.

### Paragraph 3:1–4

The Israelites left Shittim to go near the Jordan River, and set up camp there. Three days later they received instructions to set out and follow the ark, which was carried by the priests.

#### 3:4a

**But keep a distance of about two thousand cubits between yourselves and the ark.**

* However, you must keep about half a mile between you and the covenant box.
* But make sure there is a space of about one kilometer between you and the holy chest.

**But:** The Hebrew adverb that the BSB translates as *But* indicates a restriction. It can also be translated as “however” or “but.”3:4 Williams p. 65 para 388\. The Israelites were told to follow behind the covenant box, but they must not get too close to it.

**keep a distance of about two thousand cubits between yourselves and the ark:** The clause *keep a distance…between yourselves and the ark* is a command. The officers told the people to walk a long way behind the covenant box.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> you(plur) must leave a distance between you and the covenant box

**about two thousand cubits:** A “cubit” is the length of the forearm, or about half a meter. Two thousand cubits is about one kilometer, or half a mile. Use the units of measurement most familiar in your language.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> However, there must be about half a mile between you and the covenant box.

> But you must stay about one kilometer away from the holy chest.

#### 3:4b

**Do not go near it,**

* Do not go near it.
* Do not follow it too closely.

**Do not go near it:** Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> Do not follow it too closely

#### 3:4c

**so that you can see the way to go, since you have never traveled this way before.”**

* Follow it so that you(plur) will know where to go, because you have not walked on this path before.”
* You have never gone this way before, so the holy chest will show you which way to go.”

**so that:** The Hebrew preposition that the BSB translates as *so that* indicates purpose. It can also be translated “in order that” or “that.”3:4 Williams p. 61 para 367\.

**you can see the way to go:** The clause *you can see the way to go* explains the purpose of following the covenant box. The box will lead the Israelites on the path they should take.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> so that you will know which path to go on

**since:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *since* indicates a reason. It can also be translated as “because.” The covenant box will show them the way because they have not gone on this path before.

**you have never traveled this way before:** Here is another way to translate this part of the verse:

> you have never traveled along this path before

In some languages it may be more natural to reverse the order of these clauses, as the GNT has done:

> You have never been here before, so they will show you the way to go. (GNT)

##### **General Comment on 3:4a\-b**

In some languages it may be more natural to change the order of these clauses. For example:

> 4bBut do not get near the Covenant Box; 4astay about half a mile behind it. (GNT)

### Paragraph 3:5

Joshua ordered the people to purify themselves.

#### 3:5a

**Then Joshua told the people,**

* ¶ Then Joshua said to the people:
* ¶ Joshua told the Israelites:

**Then:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *Then* indicates the next event in the story. This is the beginning of a new paragraph. Make sure your translation indicates that this is a new paragraph in the most natural way.

**Joshua told the people:** Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Joshua told the people

> Then Joshua said to the Israelites

#### 3:5b

**“Consecrate yourselves,**

* “Make yourselves holy,
* “Clean yourselves so that you may be pure in the eyes of Yahweh.

**Consecrate yourselves:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Consecrate* means that people should do a ritual that makes them pure and sets them apart to be holy for Yahweh. An example of what the people did is found in Exodus 19:10 where Yahweh told Moses that the people must wash their clothes. In Exodus 19:15 Moses told the people not to have sex.

We do not know what ritual the people did in this verse. It is best to translate this word in a general way.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> purify yourselves

> make yourselves holy

> prepare yourselves so that you will be pure

#### 3:5c

**for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you.”**

* because Yahweh is going to do things that make you astonished tomorrow.”
* Tomorrow Yahweh will do some amazing things for us to see.”

**for:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *for* introduces the reason why the Israelites must purify themselves. It can also be translated as “because.” They should purify themselves because Yahweh will do something amazing among them tomorrow.

**tomorrow the LORD will do wonders:** The *wonders* are extraordinary things that amaze people. The wonders that Yahweh will do stop the water of the Jordan River from flowing.

**among you:** The phrase *among you* refers to Joshua as well as the Israelites. In some languages it may be more natural to say:

> among us(incl)

> for us to see

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> because tomorrow Yahweh will do an amazing thing among us

> because tomorrow Yahweh will do something for you to see that makes you astonished

#### 3:6a

**And he said to the priests,**

* ¶ Then Joshua said to the priests:
* ¶ The next day, Joshua told the priests:

**And:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *And* indicates the next event in the story.

**he said to the priests:** In verse 3:5 Joshua told the people that Yahweh will do wonders “tomorrow.” The events of verse 3:6 took place on the next day. It may be helpful to make this explicit. For example:

> The next day, Joshua said to the priests

#### 3:6b

**“Take the ark of the covenant**

* “Lift up the covenant box,
* “Carry the holy chest on poles on your shoulders,

**Take the ark of the covenant:** The clause *Take the ark of the covenant* indicates that the priests were to put the covenant box on the carrying poles and carry it. Some languages have a special verb to indicate this method of carrying.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Pick up the covenant box on poles on your shoulders

> Lift the holy chest to carry it on poles on your shoulders

#### 3:6c

**and go on ahead of the people.”**

* and carry it on poles on your shoulders ahead of the people.”
* and set out with the people following you.”

**and:** the Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *and* indicates the next event in the story.

**go on ahead of the people:** Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> go ahead of the people

> walk in front of the people

#### 3:6d

**So they carried the ark of the covenant**

* Then they lifted up the covenant box
* So the priests carried the holy chest on poles on their shoulders.

**So:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *So* indicates the next event in the story.

This is the beginning of a new paragraph. Make sure your translation indicates this is a new paragraph in a natural way.

**Now the LORD said to Joshua:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *Now* indicates the next event in the story.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Yahweh told Joshua,

#### 3:7b

**“Today I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel,**

* “Today I will begin to make you(sing) great in the eyes of all the Israelites.
* “I will begin today to make all the people of Israel honor you.

**Today:** This can also be translated as *Today*.

**I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *exalt* is more literally “make great.” Yahweh said that he will make the Israelite people honor and respect Joshua. The clause *I will begin to exalt you* indicates that this was the beginning of how Yahweh will make Joshua great. This will happen because Joshua will be the leader who takes them across the Jordan River.

**in the sight of all Israel:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *in the sight of all Israel* is more literally “in the eyes of all Israel.” This indicates that all the Israelites will see that Joshua is great.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Today I will lift you up in the eyes of all the Israelites

> Beginning from today, I will make all the Israel people think that you are great

> What I do today will make all the people of Israel begin to honor you as a great man (GNT)

#### 3:7c

**so they may know that I am with you just as I was with Moses.**

* They will know that I will be with you just as I was with Moses.
* Then they will know that I will be with you to help you in the same way that I was with Moses.

**so:** The Hebrew relative particle that the BSB translates as *so* indicates purpose. It can also be translated “so that.” Yahweh will make Joshua great so that the Israelites will know that Yahweh is with Joshua.

**they may know that I am with you just as I was with Moses:** The clause *I am with you* indicates that Yahweh is with Joshua to guide and help him. Yahweh gave this promise to Joshua in Joshua 1:5b. You should translate this clause the same way as you did in that verse.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> so that they will know that I will be with you in the same way that I was with Moses

> then they will know that I will help you as I helped Moses

### Paragraph 3:7–8

Yahweh promised Joshua that the people will respect him. He also told Joshua what the priests should do.

#### 3:8a

**Command the priests carrying the ark of the covenant:**

* You(sing) must command the priests who are carrying the covenant box:
* Tell the priests who are carrying the holy chest

The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB leaves untranslated but many English versions translate as “And” indicates the next action in the story.

**Command:** The Hebrew is literally “you shall command.” The pronoun “you” refers to Joshua. It is emphatic in Hebrew. Some English versions translate in such a way as to make this clear. For example:

> You are the one who shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant (NRSV)

> For your part, command the priests who carry the Ark of the Covenant as follows (NJPS)

**the priests carrying the ark of the covenant:** Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> the priests who carry the covenant box on poles on their shoulders

#### 3:8b

**‘When you reach the edge of the waters,**

* ‘When you(plur) come to the banks of the Jordan River,

**When you reach the edge of the waters:** The phrase *the edge of the waters* refers to the edge of the Jordan River.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> When you come to the edge of the Jordan River

> When you arrive at the bank of the Jordan River

#### 3:8c

**stand in the Jordan.’”**

* stand still in the water.’”
* they should enter the water and stand near the edge.”

**stand in the Jordan:** The clause *stand in the Jordan* is a command. Joshua told the priests to stand in the water.

Here is another way to translate this part of the verse:

> you must stand in the water by the edge of the river

The priests had to walk into the water before they stood still. In some languages it may be clearer to include this implicit information. For example:

> When you reach the banks of the Jordan River, take a few steps into the river and stop there (NLT)

##### **General Comment on 3:8a\-c**

This is a quotation contained within a quotation. In some languages it may be more natural to use an indirect quotation. For example:

#### 3:10a

**He continued, “This is how you will know that the living God is among you**

* Then Joshua said: “This is how you(plur) will know that the living God is among you.
* When the people had come Joshua said: “This is what is going to happen. When it happens, you will know that the God who is alive is among you.

The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB leaves untranslated and many English versions translate as “And” indicates the next action in the story.

**He continued:** There is some implied information here. In verse 9b Joshua told the people to “come here.” The people came, and then Joshua continued to speak.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> after the people had come Joshua said

> the people came together and then Joshua said

**This is how you will know:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *This is how* is more literally “in this” or “by this.” It refers to what Joshua will say in 3:11–13\.

**that the living God:** Joshua refers to Yahweh as *the living God*. This means that Yahweh is alive, and that he acts to help his people. The Israelites will know he is alive by the things he does.

Here are some other ways to translate this term:

> the God who has life

> the God who always lives

**is among you:** The phrase *among you* means that God was with the Israelites.

Joshua was also an Israelite. In some languages it may be better to say:

> is among us(incl)

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> After the people gathered, Joshua said to them, “By this you will know that the God who is alive is with you

> When the people had come, Joshua told them, “This is how you will know that the God who has life is with us

#### 3:10b

**and that He will surely drive out before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites.**

* You will know that he will surely drive out the people of Canaan, Heth, Hiv, Periz, the Girgash, the Amor, and Jebus in front of you.
* You will know that, as you go forward, he will certainly force out the people of this land: the Canaan people, the Hitti people, the Hiw people, the Periz people, the Girgash people, the Amor people and the Yabus people.

**and that He will surely drive out before you:** The Hebrew words that the BSB translates as *He will surely drive out* are more literally “drive out he will drive out.” This is a Hebrew idiom that indicates emphasis. Yahweh will certainly drive the Canaanites out of the land. He will take away the land from them and give it to the Israelites. Some languages have a grammatical marker or particle to indicate this emphasis.

**before you:** The phrase *before you* can also be translated “in front of you” or “ahead of you.”

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> as you go forward, he will certainly drive out…

Joshua was one of the Israelites. In some languages it may be more natural to say:

> from before us(incl)

**the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites:** These seven groups of people lived in the land of Canaan. This list is the same as the list in Deuteronomy 7:1\.

The suffix “ite” is an English suffix that means “people.” It does not come from Hebrew. The Hebrew name of these seven groups is similar to this:

> Canaan people, Hitti people, Hiw people, Periz people, Girgash people, Amor people, Yabus people

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Yahweh will surely force these groups of people to leave from before you: the Canaan people, the Hitti people, the Hiw people, the Periz people, the Girgash people, the Amor people and the Jebus people

> As you go forward, he will certainly drive out the Canaan group, the Hitti group, the Hiw group, the Periz group, the Girgash group, the Amor group and the Yabus group

The Israelites waited three days beside the Jordan and then crossed the river. The priests carried the ark and led the way. As soon as the priests stepped into the river, the water stopped flowing, and everyone was able to cross the river on dry ground.

### Paragraph 3:9–13

Joshua told the people about the miracle that Yahweh will do.

#### 3:11

**Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth will go ahead of you into the Jordan.**

* See, the covenant box of the Lord of the whole earth will go into the Jordan River before you(plur).
* You will know this when you see the holy chest which shows that the ruler of all the earth is with us. This chest, the priests will carry it into the Jordan River ahead of you.

**Behold:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Behold* calls attention to the next statement. In verse 10 Joshua told the Israelites that they will know that Yahweh is with them. In this verse Joshua tells them how they will know that.

Here are some other ways to translate this word:

> Look

> See

> This is how you will know

**the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth will go ahead of you into the Jordan:** Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> the priests will carry the covenant box, which shows that the Lord of all the earth is with you, ahead of you into the Jordan River

**the ark of the covenant…will go ahead:** In some languages it is not natural to speak of a box doing something. It may be more natural to make the priests be the subject of the sentence.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> the priests will carry the covenant box

However, the Hebrew text puts emphasis on the *ark*, not on the priests. The ark was the symbol of God’s presence with the Israelites. If possible, use the grammar of your language to make the covenant box be the topic or the focus of the sentence. For example:

> as for the covenant box, the priests will carry it into the Jordan River

**the ark of the covenant:** Translate this the same way you did at 3:3b.

**the Lord of all the earth:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Lord* can also be translated “master” or “ruler.” It is not the same as the name Yahweh.

Here are some other ways to translate this term:

> the ruler of the whole earth

> the king of the whole world

**will go ahead of you into the Jordan:** The clause *will go ahead of you into the Jordan* indicates that the covenant box will go ahead of the Israelites into the Jordan River. In verses 12–17 the priests carry the covenant box into the Jordan River and stay there. Then the people walk past it to cross the river. Finally, the priests carry the covenant box, following the people out of the river.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> See, the covenant box that belongs to the Lord of all the earth will go into the Jordan River ahead of you

> This is how you will know that God is among you. The priests will carry the holy chest of the ruler of all the earth into the Jordan River before you

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:11

## Joshua 3:12 (id: 515935)

### Section 3:1–17 The Israelites crossed the Jordan River

The Israelites waited three days beside the Jordan and then crossed the river. The priests carried the ark and led the way. As soon as the priests stepped into the river, the water stopped flowing, and everyone was able to cross the river on dry ground.

### Paragraph 3:9–13

Joshua told the people about the miracle that Yahweh will do.

#### 3:12

**Now choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe.**

* Therefore, take(plur) twelve men, one from each clan of Israel.
* So, choose one man from each of the twelve Israelite clans. I will tell you later what they should do.

**Now:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *Now* is more literally “and now.” Its function is to introduce a new thought.3:12 Holladay p. 287\. This thought is about the twelve men who have an important part in crossing the Jordan River. Their role is explained further in chapter 4\.3:12 Hess p. 113\. This sentence interrupts the instructions about the priests and the covenant box.

Here are some other ways to translate this word:

> So

> Therefore

**choose twelve men:** The reason why they chose these twelve men is not explained until Joshua 4:3\.

**from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe:** Joshua told each of the twelve tribes of Israel to choose one man from their tribe.

Here is another way to translate this part of the verse:

> So, choose twelve men, one man from each tribe of Israel

The instructions about these twelve men are not finished until Joshua 4:3\. It may be helpful to make this explicit. For example:

> So, choose twelve men, one man from each tribe of Israel. Later I will tell you what they should do.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:12

## Joshua 3:13 (id: 515937)

### Section 3:1–17 The Israelites crossed the Jordan River

The Israelites waited three days beside the Jordan and then crossed the river. The priests carried the ark and led the way. As soon as the priests stepped into the river, the water stopped flowing, and everyone was able to cross the river on dry ground.

### Paragraph 3:9–13

Joshua told the people about the miracle that Yahweh will do.

#### 3:13a

**When the feet of the priests who carry the ark of the LORD—the Lord of all the earth—**

* The feet of the priests carrying the covenant box of Yahweh, the king of the whole earth,
* As soon as the priests who carry the holy chest of Yahweh, the master of all the earth, put their feet

The Hebrew word that the BSB leaves untranslated and many English versions translate as “And” is more literally “and it will be.” It indicates what will happen next.

**When:** The Hebrew construction that the BSB translates as *When* can also be translated “as soon as.” This indicates that when the priests stepped in the water, the water stopped flowing immediately.3:13 Dallaire p. 879\.

**the feet of the priests:** The *feet* refers to the bottom part of the foot. Many English translations leave this information implicit. For example:

> the feet of the priests (NET)

**who carry:** Here is another way to translate this term:

> who carry on poles on their shoulders

**the ark of the LORD—the Lord of all the earth:** This expression is like, but not quite the same as, the expression in 3:11\.

**the ark of the LORD:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *LORD* is “Yahweh,” the name of God.

**the Lord of all the earth:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Lord* can also be translated as “master” or “ruler.” It is not the same as the name Yahweh.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Then, when the feet of the priests who carry the covenant box of Yahweh, the master of all the earth,

> The priests will carry the holy chest of Yahweh, the ruler of all the earth. When their feet…

#### 3:13b

**touch down in the waters of the Jordan,**

* will stand in the water of the Jordan River.
* into the water,

**touch down in the waters of the Jordan:** The clause *touch down in the waters of the Jordan* indicates that the priests’ feet will stand in the Jordan River.

**the waters of the Jordan:** the phrase *the waters of the Jordan* refers to the Jordan River. The Hebrew word for water always occurs in the plural. In English it usually occurs in the singular. Use the form that is natural in your language.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> the priests put their feet into the water of the Jordan River

> the priests step into the Jordan River

#### 3:13c

**its flowing waters will be cut off**

* Immediately, the water will stop flowing.
* God will stop it from flowing.

**its flowing waters will be cut off:** This clause is more literally “the waters of the Jordan will be cut off.” This is a passive sentence.

Here are two ways to translate this passive sentence:

* Use a passive verb. For example:

    > its waters flowing downstream will be cut off (NIV)

* Use an active verb. Here are some ways to translate it with an active verb:

    > the waters coming downstream toward you will stop flowing (NET)

    > God will stop the water from flowing down toward you

Use the form that is most natural in your language.

**its flowing waters:** The phrase *its flowing waters* refers to the Jordan River that was flowing down from its source at a higher place to the place where the Israelites were.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> the water that flows down toward you

#### 3:13d

**and will stand up in a heap.”**

* The water coming from upstream will pile up in a heap.”
* He will cause the water coming down to collect in one place.”

**will stand up in a heap:** The clause *will stand up in a heap* indicates that the water of the Jordan River would stand up like a wall in one place. Instead of continuing to flow along the riverbed where the Israelites were about to cross, the water piled up at a distance up the river.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> will stand like a wall

> will pile up in one place (GNT)

##### **General Comment on 3:13c\-d**

In some languages it may be more natural to reverse the order of 3:13c and 3:13d. For example:

> 13dthe water will pile up in a heap upstream 13cand will not flow down toward you

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:13

## Joshua 3:14 (id: 515939)

### Section 3:1–17 The Israelites crossed the Jordan River

The Israelites waited three days beside the Jordan and then crossed the river. The priests carried the ark and led the way. As soon as the priests stepped into the river, the water stopped flowing, and everyone was able to cross the river on dry ground.

### Paragraph 3:14–17

The water of the Jordan River stopped flowing and the Israelites crossed on dry ground.

#### 3:14a

**So when the people broke camp**

* ¶ When the people took down their tents to go
* ¶ Then the people took down their tents and left the place where they had been camping

**So:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *So* is more literally “and it was.” It marks the return to the narrative after Joshua’s speech. The story continues after the Israelites listened to what Joshua said. Translate this return to the narrative in a way that is natural in your language.

**when the people broke camp:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *broke camp* is more literally “pull out.” It refers to pulling out the tent pegs and taking down their tents.3:14 Holladay p 240\.

The clause *when the people broke camp* indicates that the Israelite people took down their tents and left the place where they stayed. They took their tents with them.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> when the people took down their tents and set out

> when the people set out from the place where they had been camping

#### 3:14b

**to cross the Jordan,**

* across the Jordan River,
* to cross the Jordan River.

**to cross the Jordan:** Here is another way to translate this part of the verse:

> to cross the Jordan River

#### 3:14c

**the priests carried the ark of the covenant ahead of them.**

* the priests who were carrying the ark of the covenant went ahead of them.
* The priests carried the holy chest ahead of the people,

**the priests carried the ark of the covenant ahead of them:** Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> with the priests carrying the ark of the covenant in front of the people

> The priests carried the covenant box on poles on their shoulders ahead of the people

##### **General Comment on 3:14a\-c**

Some English versions follow the Hebrew in making this a dependent clause. In some languages it may be more natural to start a new sentence here, and make this be an independent sentence, like the BSB does.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:14

## Joshua 3:15 (id: 515941)

### Section 3:1–17 The Israelites crossed the Jordan River

The Israelites waited three days beside the Jordan and then crossed the river. The priests carried the ark and led the way. As soon as the priests stepped into the river, the water stopped flowing, and everyone was able to cross the river on dry ground.

### Paragraph 3:14–17

The water of the Jordan River stopped flowing and the Israelites crossed on dry ground.

#### 3:15a

**Now the Jordan overflows its banks throughout the harvest season.**

* (The Jordan River had risen over all its banks because it was harvest time.)
* (It was the time when they harvested barley, and the river was flooding.)

**Now the Jordan overflows its banks throughout the harvest season:** This is background information. It explains the miracle that God performed. At that time of year, the river was full and overflowing. The people were able to cross the river even though the river was full of water.

**the harvest season:** The *harvest* refers to the barley harvest which happened in April. At that time snow melted in the mountains and made the river flood.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> it was the spring season when they harvested barley

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> It was harvest time, and the river was in flood (GNT)

> The water of the Jordan River had risen over its banks, as it did during harvest time.

#### 3:15b

**But as soon as the priests carrying the ark reached the Jordan**

* The feet of the priests who were carrying the covenant box
* and arrived at the Jordan River.

**But as soon as the priests carrying the ark reached the Jordan:** The BSB follows the Hebrew in making this a dependent clause. In some languages it may be more natural to make this be an independent sentence. For example:

> Then the priests carried the ark and reached the Jordan River.

**as soon as:** The Hebrew construction that the BSB translates as *as soon as* is the same as in verse 3:13a. It can be translated “when.”

**the priests carrying the ark:** The phrase *the priests carrying the ark* refers to the priests who were carrying the covenant box. In Hebrew, the word *priests* is not made explicit until verse 15c. It may be more natural in some languages to make it explicit here and use a pronoun in the next part of the verse, as the BSB does.

**the ark:** The Hebrew sometimes refers to the ark of the covenant in a shortened form as *the ark*. You should follow natural discourse patterns when you translate this into your language. See how you translated it in verse 3b.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> When the priests who carried the covenant box reached the Jordan River

> As soon as the priests carrying the holy chest came to the Jordan River

#### 3:15c

**and their feet touched the water’s edge,**

* touched the water at the river’s edge.
* The priests carrying the chest stepped into the river.

**and their feet touched the water’s edge:** Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> they stepped into the water at the edge of the river

> and their feet touched the water at the edge of the river

##### **General Comment on 3:15a\-c**

Each language has a different way to express background information like that in verse 3:15a. One way to include background information would be to put the words in parentheses. In some languages it may be clearer to reorder the clauses and begin with the background information. For example:

> 15aNow the Jordan is at flood stage all during harvest. 15bYet as soon as the priests who carried the ark reached the Jordan 15cand their feet touched the water’s edge, (NIV)

#### 3:15a\-c

**(reordered) It was the time of the barley harvest, and the river was flooding. The feet of the priests who were carrying the covenant box touched the water at the edge of the river.**

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:15

## Joshua 3:16 (id: 515942)

### Section 3:1–17 The Israelites crossed the Jordan River

The Israelites waited three days beside the Jordan and then crossed the river. The priests carried the ark and led the way. As soon as the priests stepped into the river, the water stopped flowing, and everyone was able to cross the river on dry ground.

### Paragraph 3:14–17

The water of the Jordan River stopped flowing and the Israelites crossed on dry ground.

#### 3:16a

**the flowing water stood still. It backed up**

* Then the water which came down from upstream stopped flowing and piled up in a heap a long distance away
* As soon as they stepped into the water, the water that was flowing down toward them stopped, and collected in one place, a long way upstream.

**the flowing water:** The phrase *the flowing water* was first used in verse 3:13d. You should translate it the same way in both places.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> the water that was flowing down toward them

**stood still:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *stood still* can also be translated “stopped moving.” It indicates that the river water stopped flowing down from above. This corresponds to the event described in verse 3:13c.

Here is another way to translate this verb:

> stopped flowing

**It backed up:** The clause *It backed up* is similar in meaning to the clause “will stand up in a heap” in verse 3:13d. In this verse the narrator used a different verb, but you may be able to use the same verb in both verses.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> It rose up like a dam (GW)

> it piled up

#### 3:16b

**as far upstream as Adam, a city in the area of Zarethan,**

* at the town of Adam, which is near the town of Zarethan.
* This place was beside the city of Adam, near the city of Zarethan.

**far upstream:** Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> a long distance away

> far off (RSV)

**Adam:** The town of *Adam* was about 18 miles north of Jericho.3:16 Dallaire p 881\.

**a city in the area of Zarethan:** The location of the town of *Zarethan* is uncertain.

**city:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *city* refers to a permanent settlement of houses with a wall around it for protection. These cities were not large places. The largest of the cities mentioned in Joshua may have had a population of two or three thousand people. Most of them were much smaller.

The Hebrew language does not distinguish between “city” and “town.” It does distinguish between a city/town and a village. Because they were small cities, some English versions translate the Hebrew word as “town” rather than *city*. In these Notes we follow those versions and use the word “town.”

Consider the word in your language that is appropriate for a small permanent settlement with a wall around it.

Here is another way to translate this part of the verse:

> at the town of Adam, which was near the town of Zarethan

#### 3:16c

**while the water flowing toward the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea) was completely cut off.**

* The water which flowed down to the sea of the Arabah, which was also called the Salt Sea, stopped completely.
* No more water flowed down to the Salt Sea (also called the sea of the Arabah).

**while the water flowing:** The phrase *while the water flowing* refers to the water that continued to flow downstream from where the people crossed.

**toward the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea):** The names *Sea of the Arabah* and *Salt Sea* both refer to the same lake. This is the lake that the Jordan River flows into. This lake is very salty and no fish can live in it. In Hebrew it is usually called the *Salt Sea*. In English it is called the Dead Sea.

The name *Sea of the Arabah* refers to its location. The Hebrew term *Arabah* refers to the valley of the Jordan River.

In English this lake is called the Dead Sea. If your language has a name other than *Salt Sea* there are two ways you can translate it.

* Translate it literally as *Salt Sea*. For example:

    > Salt Sea (ESV)

* Translate it with its common name in your language. For example:

    > Dead Sea (NLT)

If you translate it literally you may want to have a footnote. For example:

> FOOTNOTE: This refers to the lake that in our language we call the Dead Sea

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> the Dead Sea (the sea of the Jordan River valley)

> the Salt Sea (the sea near the Arabah)

**was completely cut off:** The Hebrew verb phrase that the BSB translates as *completely cut off* is more literally “they were complete, they were cut off.” The water downstream from the Israelites was separated from the heap of water that was upstream. No more water flowed downstream to the Dead Sea.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> no more water flowed down to the Salt Sea (also called the sea of the Arabah)

> the water flowing down to the Dead Sea completely stopped

#### 3:16d

**So the people crossed over opposite Jericho.**

* Then the people crossed the river opposite Jericho.
* The people of Israel crossed the river near the town of Jericho.

**So the people crossed over:** The clause *the people crossed over* indicates that the Israelites crossed the river.

**opposite Jericho:** *Jericho* was a town on the west side of the Jordan River. Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> near the town of Jericho

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> The people crossed the river opposite Jericho

> When the water was all gone , the Israelites crossed the Jordan River near Jericho

The Israelites waited three days beside the Jordan and then crossed the river. The priests carried the ark and led the way. As soon as the priests stepped into the river, the water stopped flowing, and everyone was able to cross the river on dry ground.

### Paragraph 3:14–17

The water of the Jordan River stopped flowing and the Israelites crossed on dry ground.

#### 3:17a

**The priests carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD**

* The priests carrying the covenant box of Yahweh
* The priests carrying the holy chest of Yahweh

**The priests carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD:** In verse 3:13a the priests were called “the priests who carry the ark of the LORD.” In verse 3:14 it said “the priests carried the ark of the covenant.” In this verse the two expressions are combined. Translate this expression in a way that combines the words in those verses well.

#### 3:17b

**stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan,**

* stood on dry ground in the middle of the river,
* stood firmly in the middle of the Jordan River on dry ground.

**stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan:** The priests moved from the edge of the river to the middle of the river and stood there while all the Israelites walked past them.

**stood firm:** The Hebrew words that the BSB translates as *stood firm* are more literally “stood to be firm.”3:17 Woudstra p. 88; Boling and Wright p. 171\. This can be translated in English as “stood firmly.” This emphasizes the miracle that Yahweh did when he stopped the water. Although some English versions do not translate the word “to be firm” it is recommended that you translate it.3:17 Bratcher p. 45 says that it is not necessary to translate it because it may mean “right there.” Most commentaries (Woudstra, Boling and Wright, Butler) agree with the meaning of “firmly” from the *Hiphil* infinitive absolute of the Hebrew verb. The lexicons also agree with this definition for the form found in this verse.

Here are some other ways to translate these Hebrew words:

> stood firmly (ESV, NET, GW)

> stood on dry ground (GNT)

#### 3:17c

**while all Israel crossed over the dry ground,**

* while all the Israelites crossed the river on dry ground.
* All the Israelite people walked across the river on dry ground,

**while all Israel:** The phrase *all Israel* indicates all the Israelite people.

**crossed over the dry ground:** The clause *crossed over the dry ground* indicates that the bed of the Jordan River was dry where the Israelites crossed the Jordan River.

Here is another way to translate this part of the verse:

> All the Israelites crossed the river on dry ground

#### 3:17d

**until the entire nation had crossed the Jordan.**

* They stood there until all the people crossed the river.
* until all the people had crossed.

**until the entire nation:** The phrase *the entire nation* refers to all the Israelite people.

**had crossed the Jordan:** The clause *had crossed the Jordan* can also be translated “had crossed the Jordan River.”

Here is another way to translate this part of the verse:

> until the whole Israelite nation finished crossing the Jordan River

##### **General Comment on 3:17**

The Hebrew text places the action of the priests at the beginning of the sentence to emphasize it. Throughout this story, the focus is on the covenant box of Yahweh and the priests who carried it. This concluding statement keeps this focus. It may be possible to translate in a way that keeps this emphasis. For example:

> The priests carrying the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firmly on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan. All Israel crossed over on dry ground until the entire nation was on the other side. (NET)

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 3:17

## Joshua 4:1 (id: 515946)

Twelve men from among the Israelites each took a stone from the middle of the Jordan River. With these stones Joshua built a monument to remind the Israelite people, and their descendants, about how God helped them cross the river.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Setting up memorial stones

> Twelve memorial stones

> A reminder that God brought them to the promised land

#### 4:1a

**When the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan,**

* ¶ When all the Israelite people crossed the Jordan,
* ¶ All the Israelites finished crossing over the Jordan River.

**When the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan:** In some languages it may be more natural to make this into an independent clause. For example, you could say:

> 1aAll the Israelites finished crossing the Jordan River. 1bThen Yahweh said to Joshua…

**the whole nation:** The phrase *the whole nation* refers to all the Israelite people.

**had finished crossing the Jordan:** The phrase *had finished crossing the Jordan* means that the Israelites crossed over to the west side of the Jordan River.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Setting up memorial stones

> Twelve memorial stones

> A reminder that God brought them to the promised land

#### 4:2

This verse is a repetition of the command that Yahweh gave to Joshua in 3:12\. It is repeated because the emphasis of this story is on how the representatives of the twelve Israelite tribes set up memorial stones.

#### 4:2a

**“Choose twelve men from among the people,**

* “Choose twelve men from among the Israelites
* “Now choose twelve men from the people of Israel

**Choose twelve men:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *Choose* is imperative. It means that Yahweh commanded Joshua to choose *twelve men*.

**from among the people:** The phrase *from among the people* means that Joshua was to choose the men from among the Israelites.

#### 4:2b

**one from each tribe,**

* one man per clan.
* one man from every clan of Israelite people.

**one from each tribe:** The phrase *one from each tribe* means that Joshua must choose one man from each of the twelve Israelite tribes.

**tribe:** See how you translated this term in 1:12\|.

Twelve men from among the Israelites each took a stone from the middle of the Jordan River. With these stones Joshua built a monument to remind the Israelite people, and their descendants, about how God helped them cross the river.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Setting up memorial stones

> Twelve memorial stones

> A reminder that God brought them to the promised land

#### 4:3a\-b

The BSB uses a direct quote. In some languages it may be more natural to use an indirect quote. For example, you could say:

> Command them to take twelve stones

#### 4:3a

**and command them:**

* Tell them,
* You must command them to do this:

**and command them:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *command them* is imperative. It means that God commanded Joshua to give a command (4:3b\-e) to the group of men he chose.

#### 4:3b

**‘Take up for yourselves twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan**

* ‘Each one of you must take a stone from the middle of the Jordan River
* ‘You must each pick up a rock from the middle of the river.

**Take up for yourselves twelve stones:** The phrase *Take up for yourselves twelve stones* means that each of the twelve men must pick up one stone.

**stones:** These would have been large stones, about as large as a single person could carry.

**from the middle of the Jordan:** The phrase *from the middle of the Jordan* indicates that the men must take stones from the place where the priests were standing. The priests were standing in the middle of the Jordan river. The water had stopped flowing when the priests entered the water, which allowed the people to walk across the bottom of the (dry) river bed (see 3:17b\-c). The men were supposed to take the twelve rocks from the bottom of the river from that same area. Here are some other ways to translate these verse part:

> Take twelve stones out of the middle of the Jordan (GNT)

> Tell them to get twelve rocks from the middle of the river (NCV)

#### 4:3c

**where the priests were standing,**

* from the exact place where the priests’ feet are standing.
* You must take the rocks from the same place where the priests are standing.

**where the priests were standing:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *where the priests were standing* is more literally “the firm standing place of the feet of the priests.” The twelve men picked up the stones while the priests were still standing in the middle of the river. Another way to translate this is:

> from right where the priests are standing (NIV)

**where:** The Hebrew word translated as *where* emphasizes that the men must pick up stones from the exact place where the priests are standing. Another way to show this emphasis would be:

> from the very place where the priests’ feet stood (RSV)

#### 4:3d

**carry them with you,**

* Carry them over to the other side,
* Carry the stones to the west bank of the river.

**carry them with you:** The phrase *carry them with you* means that each man must carry the stone he picked up, and take it to the other side of the river.

#### 4:3e

**and set them down in the place where you spend the night.’”**

* and lay them down at the camping place where you will sleep tonight.’”
* Then put them down in the same place that you will stay tonight.’”

**and set them down:** The phrase *set them down* means that each man is to put his rock down on the ground.

**in the place where you spend the night:** The phrase *in the place where you spend the night* indicates the place where they were to put down the stones.

**spend the night:** The phrase *spend the night* means that the Israelites lived in that place for a short time (probably a few days or weeks).

Twelve men from among the Israelites each took a stone from the middle of the Jordan River. With these stones Joshua built a monument to remind the Israelite people, and their descendants, about how God helped them cross the river.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Setting up memorial stones

> Twelve memorial stones

> A reminder that God brought them to the promised land

#### 4:4

There is implied information at the beginning of 4:4\. It does not say explicitly that Joshua chose the men. You may wish to include this implied information.

Here is a way to translate the implied information:

> Joshua chose one man from each tribe, and then he called the twelve men

#### 4:4a

**So Joshua summoned the twelve men he had appointed from the Israelites,**

* ¶ Then Joshua called the twelve Israelite men,
* ¶ Then Joshua called together the twelve men

**So Joshua summoned the twelve men:** The phrase *Joshua summoned the twelve men* indicates that Joshua gathered the twelve men he had chosen in order to give them God’s command.

**from the Israelites:** The phrase *from the Israelites* emphasizes that these men were all Israelite men. It may be redundant to translate this phrase in some languages, because it is clear from previous verses that these were Israelite men. It may be more natural to leave this phrase implicit.

#### 4:4b

**one from each tribe,**

* whom he had chosen, one from each clan of Israel.
* that he had chosen earlier, one man per clan.

**he had appointed:** The phrase *he had appointed* refers to the men that Joshua chose to carry the stones.

**one from each tribe:** A similar phrase is found in 4:2b. The purpose of *one from each tribe* was so that each tribe had a representative.

##### **General Comment on 4:4**

It might be helpful to reorder the phrases and to include the implied information. Some other ways to translate this verse are:

> Joshua chose one man from each of the twelve Israelite tribes. Then he called them together

> Joshua called together the twelve men he had appointed to represent the twelve Israelite tribes

### Section 4:1–5:1 The Israelites commemorated the crossing of the Jordan River

Twelve men from among the Israelites each took a stone from the middle of the Jordan River. With these stones Joshua built a monument to remind the Israelite people, and their descendants, about how God helped them cross the river.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Setting up memorial stones

> Twelve memorial stones

> A reminder that God brought them to the promised land

#### 4:5a

**and said to them,**

* Joshua told them:
* Then he commanded them:

**and:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *and* indicates the next action in the story. Use a word or particle in your language to show that the story line is progressing.

**said to them:** The phrase *said to them* indicates that Joshua told God’s command to the twelve men. In other words, Joshua repeated to the men what God said to him in 4:3\. It may be more natural in some languages to use a word such as:

> Joshua ordered them

> Joshua commanded them

#### 4:5b

**“Cross over before the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of the Jordan.**

* “Go to the middle of the Jordan River in front of the ark of Yahweh your God.
* “Go into the river where the covenant box of Yahweh your God is.

**Cross over before the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of the Jordan:** The phrase *Cross over before the ark* means that the twelve men must go into the middle of the riverbed, where the priests stood holding the ark of Yahweh.

**ark:** See 3:3 for ideas of how to translate the word *ark*.

#### 4:5c

**Each of you is to take a stone upon his shoulder,**

* Each one of you must pick up a stone and carry it on your shoulder.
* And every man must put a stone on his shoulder and carry it across the river.

**Each of you is to take a stone upon his shoulder:** The clause *Each of you is to take a stone upon his shoulder* means that each of the twelve men must pick up one stone and carry it across the river to the other side.

There is implied information here that is not made explicit until 4:8\. The men were told to carry the stones to the camping place and put them down there. You may find it helpful to include this implied information here.

Here is another way to translate this part of the verse:

> each of you should take a stone on his shoulder, and carry them to the camp and put them down there

#### 4:5d

**according to the number of the tribes of Israel,**

* There will be one stone for each of the twelve clans of Israel.
* These twelve stones will represent the twelve clans of the people of Israel.

**according to the number of the tribes of Israel:** The phrase *according to the number of the tribes* means that the twelve stones which the men carried across the river each represented one of the Israelite tribes.

##### **General Comment on 4:5**

There is some uncertainty about how 4:5 (and 4:8\) fits into the sequence of events of chapters 3–4\.

1. The Israelites finished crossing the Jordan River. Then the twelve men went back into the river to get the stones from where the priests were still holding the ark of covenant.
2. The twelve men picked up the stones while they were crossing the river with the other Israelites. Chapter 4 is a flashback that focuses on one aspect of the crossing, namely, the memorial stones.

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). In 4:1–5 it seems that Joshua talked to the twelve men after the Israelites finished crossing the river. It was after everyone was across that the ceremony of gathering the memorial stones was done.

### Section 4:1–5:1 The Israelites commemorated the crossing of the Jordan River

Twelve men from among the Israelites each took a stone from the middle of the Jordan River. With these stones Joshua built a monument to remind the Israelite people, and their descendants, about how God helped them cross the river.

#### 4:6a

**to serve as a sign among you.**

* These stones will be there for you to see.
* These stones will remind you what happened here today.

**to serve as a sign among you:** The clause *to serve as a sign among you* states the reason they gathered the twelve stones.

**sign:** The word *sign* indicates that these stones were a reminder to the Israelites of how God helped them to cross the Jordan River. When the Israelites saw the stones in the future, they would remember that Yahweh made the Jordan River stop flowing so that they could cross it.

**among you:** The phrase *among you* indicates that the stones remained where the men placed them, and were there for people to see whenever they passed by.

#### 4:6b

**In the future, when your children ask,**

* In the future your children will ask you,
* Whenever your children ask you in the future,

**In the future, when your children ask:** The clause *In the future, when your children ask* refers to the children of the Israelites as well as the future generations of Israelites.

Here is another way to translate this part of the verse:

> in the future, when your children and grandchildren ask

#### 4:6c

**‘What do these stones mean to you?’**

* ‘Why are these stones here?’
* ‘What do you remember when you see these stones?’

**What do these stones mean to you?:** The question *What do these stones mean to you?* asks why those stones are important to the Israelites.

#### 4:7a

**you are to tell them,**

* Then you must answer them,
* Answer them like this:

**you are to tell them:** In some languages it may be more natural to express the clause *you are to tell them* with a direct command. For example:

> tell them

> reply to them

#### 4:7b

**‘The waters of the Jordan were cut off**

* ‘The waters of the Jordan River stopped flowing
* ‘Yahweh made the Jordan River stop flowing

**The waters of the Jordan:** The phrase *The waters of the Jordan* refers to the Jordan River.

**were cut off:** The phrase *were cut off* means that Yahweh made the Jordan River stop flowing upstream from where the Israelites were waiting to cross it. It may be more natural for you to express this idea with an active verb, for example:

> The Jordan River stopped flowing

It may be necessary to include the agent, who is God. For example, you could say:

> God caused the Jordan River to stop flowing

#### 4:7c

**before the ark of the covenant of the LORD.**

* when the ark of the covenant of Yahweh
* when the priests carried his covenant box.

**before the ark of the covenant of the LORD:** It may be more natural in some languages to combine the phrase *before the ark of the covenant of the LORD* with the phrase in verse 4:7d. For example:

> when the priests carried the ark of the covenant of Yahweh over the Jordan River

> while the ark of the covenant of Yahweh was crossing the Jordan River

**ark of the covenant:** See 3:3 for ideas about how to translate this phrase.

#### 4:7d

**When it crossed the Jordan,**

* was crossing the Jordan River.
* When the covenant box crossed the river

**When it crossed the Jordan:** The clause *When it crossed the Jordan* means that the priests carried the ark across the Jordan River. You may have already combined this clause with the phrase in verse 4:7c.

#### 4:7e

**the waters were cut off.’**

* At that time the Jordan River stopped flowing.’
* the river stopped flowing.’

**the waters were cut off:** The clause *the waters were cut off* is a repetition of 4:7b. It may be more natural in some languages not to repeat this information. If this repetition is natural in your language, you should translate this clause in the same way that you translated verse 4:7b.

#### 4:7f

**Therefore these stones will be a memorial to the Israelites forever.”**

* These stones will always remind the Israelites of what happened here.”
* Whenever the Israelites see these stones, they will remember what happened here.”

**Therefore these stones will be a memorial to the Israelites forever:** The sentence *these stones will be a memorial to the Israelites forever* repeats the information given in verse 4:6a using different words. It is repeated to show how important these stones were. They reminded the Israelites of the great miracle that Yahweh had done. If this repetition is not natural in your language, it is possible to combine this information with the beginning of verse 6a. You would then need to combine verses 4:6–7 in your numbering of them. For example:

> 6bSomeday your children will ask, 6c“Why are these rocks here?” 7aThen you can tell them 7ehow the water stopped flowing 7dwhen the chest was being carried across the river. 6aThese rocks will always remind our people of what happened here today. (CEV)

**memorial:** A *memorial* is something that helps people to remember. This *memorial* refers to the stones that reminded the people of Israel of what Yahweh had done.

Here are some other ways to translate this word:

> memory\-stone

> something to help you remember

> when you see the stones, you will remember

#### 4:8a

**Thus the Israelites did as Joshua had commanded them.**

* ¶ Then the twelve Israelite men followed Joshua’s command.
* ¶ So the Israelite men did what he told them.

**Thus:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Thus* indicates that the next action in the story is about to take place. Use a word or particle in your language to show that the story line is progressing.

**the Israelites:** The phrase *the Israelites* refers to the twelve men that Joshua chose to carry the stones.

**did as Joshua had commanded them:** Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> The men followed Joshua’s orders (GNT)

> So the Israelites obeyed Joshua (NCV)

#### 4:8b

**They took up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan,**

* They took twelve rocks out of the middle of the river,
* They picked up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan River.

**took up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan:** The phrase *took up twelve stones* means that they picked up twelve stones, The stones were lying in the riverbed. Because the water had stopped flowing, the men could pick up the stones easily.

**the middle of the Jordan:** The phrase *the middle of the Jordan* refers to the middle of the Jordan riverbed that was dry.

#### 4:8c

**one for each tribe of Israel,**

* one stone for every clan of Israel,
* Each rock represented one of the twelve clans of Israel.

**one for each tribe of Israel:** The phrase *one for each tribe of Israel* is a repetition of 4:5d. There were twelve tribes, and there were also twelve stones.

#### 4:8d

**just as the LORD had told Joshua;**

* as Yahweh commanded Joshua.
* They obeyed the command which Yahweh gave to Joshua.

**just as the LORD had told Joshua:** The phrase *as the LORD had told Joshua* emphasizes that the command to pick up the stones came from Yahweh, not from Joshua. It may be more natural in some languages to combine this phrase with 4:8a. For example:

> The men followed the instructions that the Lord had given Joshua (CEV)

#### 4:8e

**and they carried them to the camp,**

* They carried the stones over the river to their camping place,
* They carried the rocks across the river to the place where they stayed temporarily,

**and:** The word *and* indicates that the next action in the story is about to take place. It may be more natural in some languages to begin a new sentence here. Use a word or particle in your language to show that the story line is progressing.

**they carried them:** The phrase *they carried them* means that the twelve men carried the twelve stones across the river.

**to the camp:** The phrase *to the camp* refers to the place where the Israelites set up their camp or temporary dwelling place. If there is no word “camp” in your language, you may translate this phrase as “the place where they stayed for a short time.”

#### 4:8f

**where they set them down.**

* and put them down there.
* and put them on the ground there.

**where they set them down:** The phrase *where they set them down* means that the twelve men put down the stones on the ground at the place where they camped.

### Section 4:1–5:1 The Israelites commemorated the crossing of the Jordan River

Twelve men from among the Israelites each took a stone from the middle of the Jordan River. With these stones Joshua built a monument to remind the Israelite people, and their descendants, about how God helped them cross the river.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Setting up memorial stones

#### 4:9a

**Joshua also set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan,**

* Joshua also set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan River
* Then Joshua had men place another set of twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan River.

**Joshua also set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan:** There is an interpretation issue in this verse.

1. Joshua set up the twelve stones in the middle of the river at the place where the priests stood with the ark. This was a second monument. For example:

    > Joshua also set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan (NET) *(BSB, NET, RSV, ESV, GW, NAB, NASB, NCV, NJB, NJPS, NLT, REB, GNT, CEV, KJV)*

2. Joshua set up the twelve stones at their campsite. These are the stones that the twelve men carried up out of the middle of the Jordan River. They do not refer to a separate monument. For example:

    > Joshua set up the twelve stones that had been in the middle of the Jordan (NIV) *(NIV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). Nearly all English versions and most commentaries understand it this way.

It is most likely that Joshua had some people build the monument for him. You may want to make this explicit. For example:

> Joshua had some other men set up a monument (CEV)

> Joshua also had twelve stones set up (NAB)

> Joshua had the men place another set of twelve stones

**also:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *also* does not indicate that the next action in the story is about to take place. Verse 4:9 is a parenthetical comment. It may be more natural in some languages to use a word such as “and.” For example:

> And Joshua set up twelve stones (RSV)

#### 4:9b

**in the place where the priests who carried the ark of the covenant stood.**

* in the same place where the priests who carried the ark of the covenant stood.
* They marked the place where the priests stood with the covenant box.

**in the place where the priests:** The Hebrew is literally “in the place where the feet of the priests.” It may be more natural in some languages to make the words “the feet of” explicit.

**who carried the ark of the covenant stood:** The phrase *who carried the ark of the covenant* indicates that the priests were holding the ark of the covenant while they stood in the middle of river.

It may be more natural in some languages to rearrange the phrases. For example:

> where the priests had stood while carrying the Ark of the Agreement (NCV)

It is also possible to leave this phrase implicit if that is more natural in your language. For example:

> the place where the priests were standing (CEV)

#### 4:9c

**And the stones are there to this day.**

* They are still standing there today.
* Those stones are still there to this day.

**And the stones are there to this day:** The phrase *the stones are there to this day* means that the stones were still in the river at the time that the author wrote the book of Joshua.

This paragraph is a summary about the crossing of the Jordan River. The priests obeyed God’s command. They stood in the middle of the river while the rest of the Israelites crossed it. Finally, the priests with the ark of the covenant finished crossing the river.

#### 4:10a

**Now the priests who carried the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan**

* ¶ The priests who carried the ark continued standing in the middle of the Jordan River
* ¶ The priests who carried the covenant box remained standing in the river on dry ground

**Now:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Now* is the Hebrew connector between sentences in a narrative. It may be more natural in some languages to leave it out. For example:

> The priests who bore the ark remained standing (NRSV)

**remained standing in the middle of the Jordan:** The phrase *remained standing in the middle of the Jordan* indicates that the priests who were carrying the ark continued to stand in the middle of the Jordan River. The river stopped flowing, and they stood on the dry riverbed. It may be helpful to make this explicit in some languages. For example, you could say:

> The priests who carried the ark stood on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan River

#### 4:10b

**until the people had completed everything the LORD had commanded Joshua to tell them,**

* until the people finished doing everything that Yahweh commanded Joshua.
* until everyone crossed. This is what Yahweh commanded Joshua to tell them to do.

**until the people had completed everything the LORD had commanded Joshua to tell them:** The clause *until the people had completed everything the LORD had commanded Joshua to tell them* indicates that the people did everything that Yahweh commanded them to do. Yahweh gave his command to Joshua. Joshua repeated the command to the Israelites, and the Israelites obeyed the command.

#### 4:10c

**just as Moses had directed Joshua.**

* The Israelites did everything as Moses commanded Joshua.
* The people obeyed all Joshua’s commands, which he received from Moses.

**just as Moses had directed Joshua:** The phrase *just as Moses had directed Joshua* indicates that Yahweh first gave these commands to Moses before Moses died. Moses then told Joshua what Yahweh wanted the Israelites to do when they reached the Jordan.

#### 4:11a

**and after everyone had finished crossing,**

* When all the Israelites finished crossing,
* When everyone crossed the river,

**and:** The word *and* indicates that the next action in the story is about to take place.

**after:** Another time connector might be clearer such as “as soon as.” Use a time connector that is natural in your language.

**everyone had finished crossing:** The word *everyone* refers to all the Israelite people except for the priests carrying the ark.

#### 4:11b

**the priests with the ark of the LORD crossed in the sight of the people.**

* the ark of Yahweh and the priests crossed while the people watched.
* the priests carried the covenant box of Yahweh across the river as the people watched.

**the priests with the ark of the LORD:** The Hebrew language places *the ark of the LORD* first to emphasize its importance. However, the priests were still carrying the ark. It may be more natural in some languages to translate this phrase as “the priests who were carrying the ark of Yahweh.”

**ark:** See 3:3 for ideas of how to translate the word *ark*.

**crossed:** The word *crossed* means that the priests crossed the Jordan River to the other side.

**in the sight of the people:** There are two ways to interpret the phrase *in the sight of the people*:

1. The priests crossed the river while the people watched. For example:

    > …crossed as the people looked on (NET) *(BSB, NET, RSV, NCV, NIV, NLT, NRSV, KJV)*

2. The priests crossed the river and went ahead of the people. For example:

    > …went on ahead of the people (GNT) *(GNT, NAB, NJB, NJPS, REB)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). The clause “crossed in the sight of the people” points to 4:15–18\. The people came out of the river. Then they watched as the priests finished crossing the river.

* ¶ The clans of Reuben, Gad, and half of the clan of Manasseh
* ¶ The men of the clan of Reuben, Gad, and the eastern half of the clan of Manasseh

**The Reubenites:** The word *Reubenites* refers to men of the tribe of Reuben.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> men from the tribe of Reuben

**the Gadites:** The word *Gadites* refers to men of the tribe of Gad.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> men from the tribe of Gad

**and the half\-tribe of Manasseh:** The phrase *the half\-tribe of Manasseh* refers to the families of the tribe of Manasseh who asked Moses for permission to settle on the east side of the Jordan River along with the tribes of Reuben and Gad. This request and Moses’ answer is found in Numbers 32:16–33\.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> men from the east part of the tribe of Manasseh

There is implied information here. These men were also soldiers. This is made clear in 4:12b. For example:

> The armed warriors from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half\-tribe of Manasseh (NLT)

#### 4:12b

**crossed over before the Israelites, armed for battle**

* crossed over the river with their weapons ahead of the other Israelites,
* crossed the river first, carrying their weapons of war.

**crossed over before the Israelites, armed for battle:** The phrase *crossed over…armed for battle* indicates that the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half\-tribe of Manasseh took their weapons with them when they crossed over the Jordan River. They were ready to fight. They did this to show that they would keep the promise they made to Joshua in 1:16–18\. They promised to help the other tribes of Israel conquer the land of Canaan.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> they crossed the river carrying their weapons

**before the Israelites:** The phrase *before the Israelites* indicates that the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half\-tribe of Manasseh crossed the river ahead of the other tribes.

**About 40,000 troops armed for battle**

* About forty thousand Israelite soldiers carried their weapons ready for war
* There were about forty thousand men prepared to enter battle.

**About 40,000 troops armed for battle:** There is an interpretation issue here. There are two ways to understand the number 40,000\.

1. There were a total of 40,000 Israelite soldiers who crossed the Jordan River. This was the total number of soldiers for all twelve tribes combined. For example:

    > About forty thousand battle\-ready troops (NET) *(BSB, NET, RSV, ESV, NIV, NABRE, NJPS, GNT, KJV)*

2. There were 40,000 soldiers from the two and one half eastern tribes. This number does not include the soldiers from the western tribes. For example:

    > Forty thousand soldiers from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh (CEV) *(CEV, NLT)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). A total of 40,000 Israelite soldiers corresponds with the numbers of soldiers referred to in Joshua chapters 7–8 and the two battles at Ai. See especially 8:3–12\. This is the interpretation followed by many English versions, and by several commentaries.

**armed:** The word *armed* means that they carried their weapons with them.

**for battle:** The phrase *for battle* means that they were ready to fight in a war.

Here is another way to translate this part of the verse:

**Then:** The word *Then* indicates that the next action in the story is about to take place.

**the LORD said to Joshua:** It may be more natural in some languages to use a word such as:

> Yahweh ordered Joshua

> Yahweh commanded Joshua

## Joshua 4:16 (id: 515973)

### Section 4:1–5:1 The Israelites commemorated the crossing of the Jordan River

Twelve men from among the Israelites each took a stone from the middle of the Jordan River. With these stones Joshua built a monument to remind the Israelite people, and their descendants, about how God helped them cross the river.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Setting up memorial stones

> Twelve memorial stones

> A reminder that God brought them to the promised land

#### 4:16a

**“Command the priests who carry the ark of the Testimony**

* “Tell the priests who are carrying the covenant box
* “Order the priests to bring the box with the Ten Commandments in it

**Command the priests who carry the ark of the Testimony:** The phrase *the priests who carry the ark* refers to the priests who carried the ark into the middle of the Jordan River.

**the ark of the Testimony:** The *Testimony* refers to the stone tablets on which Moses had written the Ten Commandments. The *ark of the Testimony* and the “ark of the covenant” refer to the same box.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> the ark of the covenantal laws (NET)

> the box with the Ten Commandments in it

Some English versions translate this phrase in the same way that they translate “ark of the covenant.”

#### 4:16b

**to come up from the Jordan.”**

* to come out of the Jordan River.”
* up out of the river bed.”

**to come up from the Jordan:** The phrase *come up from the Jordan* means that the priests should carry the ark from the middle of the riverbed where they were standing, across to the other side of the Jordan River.

In some languages, it might be more natural to change the indirect quote into a direct quote. For example, you could say:

> Command the priests, “Come up out of the Jordan.”

## Joshua 4:17 (id: 515974)

### Section 4:1–5:1 The Israelites commemorated the crossing of the Jordan River

#### 4:17a

**So Joshua commanded the priests,**

* So Joshua told the priests:
* Then Joshua gave this command to the priests:

**So Joshua commanded the priests:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *So* indicates that the next action in the story is taking place. In this case, it also shows that Joshua’s action is a response to God’s command.

Here are some other way to translate this part of the verse:

> and so Joshua commanded the priests

> in obedience to God, Joshua commanded the priests

#### 4:17b

**“Come up from the Jordan.”**

* “Bring the ark up from the riverbed.”
* “Carry the ark up out of the river.”

**Come up from the Jordan:** The clause *Come up from the Jordan* indicates that the priests should come up from the dry riverbed and cross to the west side of the Jordan River. It may be redundant in some languages to repeat this command, which uses almost the same words as in 4:16b. It may be more natural to summarize the action. For example:

> Joshua did so (GNT)

> So Joshua gave the command (NLT)

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 4:17

#### 4:18a

**When the priests carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD**

* Then the priests who were carrying the ark of the covenant of Yahweh
* The priests who were carrying the covenant box of Yahweh

The Hebrew word that the BSB leaves untranslated but many English versions translate as “and” signals the next event in the storyline.

**the ark of the covenant of the LORD:** See how you translated this in 3:3\.

#### 4:18b

**came up out of the Jordan**

* came up out of the riverbed.
* brought the ark up from the middle of the river.

**came up out of the Jordan:** The clause *came up out of the Jordan* indicates that the priests came up from the middle of the dry riverbed to the west side of the Jordan River.

#### 4:18c

**and their feet touched the dry land,**

* When their feet touched dry ground
* As soon as their feet stepped onto dry land,

**touched the dry land:** The phrase *touched the dry land* means that the priests stepped up out of the riverbed, and onto the dry ground. It may be more natural in some languages to leave the words *touched* implicit. For example:

> And their feet were on high ground (NLT)

#### 4:18d

**the waters of the Jordan returned to their course**

* the river water began to flow
* the Jordan River flowed again

**the waters of the Jordan:** Another way to translate this is:

> the Jordan River

**returned to their course:** The phrase *returned to their course* means that the water began to flow again, as it had before the priests first stepped into the river.

#### 4:18e

**and overflowed all the banks as before.**

* and flooded its banks again, as it was before.
* and the water was as high as it was before.

**and overflowed all the banks as before:** In 3:15 it says that the Jordan River was in flood. The clause *overflowed all the banks as before* indicates that the river now returned to being flooded again. The water was as high as it was before the priests stepped into it.

**On the tenth day of the first month the people went up from the Jordan**

* ¶ The Israelites crossed the Jordan River on the tenth day of the first month.
* ¶ On the tenth day of the first month of the year, Israel crossed the Jordan River.

**On the tenth day of the first month:** The *first month* refers to the month of the Hebrew calendar that was called Abib, and later called Nisan. This month began with the first new moon occurring after March 11\. So, the people crossed the Jordan River between March 21 and April 18\.4:19 Bratcher and Newman, p. 55\.

**the people went up from the Jordan:** The Israelites walked out of the Jordan River and up onto the western bank.

#### 4:19b

**and camped at Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho.**

* They set up their camp in Gilgal, east of the city of Jericho.
* They set up their tents in a place called Gilgal, which was east of the land controlled by Jericho.

**and camped:** The word *camped* means that they set up a temporary camp or dwelling place. If there is no appropriate word in your language for “camp” you can translate it:

> they set up temporary homes

**at Gilgal:** *Gilgal* is the name of a place between Jericho and the Jordan River. At the time when the Israelites camped there, Gilgal was not yet a town. It was given the name Gilgal at the time of their encampment and probably later it became a town. The exact location of Gilgal is not known.

**on the eastern border of Jericho:** *Jericho* was a town with a large wall around it for protection against enemies.

## Joshua 4:20 (id: 515979)

### Section 4:1–5:1 The Israelites commemorated the crossing of the Jordan River

Twelve men from among the Israelites each took a stone from the middle of the Jordan River. With these stones Joshua built a monument to remind the Israelite people, and their descendants, about how God helped them cross the river.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Setting up memorial stones

> Twelve memorial stones

> A reminder that God brought them to the promised land

#### 4:20a

**And there at Gilgal Joshua set up**

* Joshua set up at Gilgal as a monument
* Joshua commanded the men to set up as a memorial at Gilgal

**Joshua set up:** It is likely that Joshua commanded the men to set up the stones. He probably did not do this himself. However, this is not certain. You may wish to rearrange the parts of this verse, for example:

> The men who had carried the twelve rocks from the Jordan brought them to Joshua, and they made them into a monument (CEV)

> Joshua had the men set up a memorial with the twelve stones that they had taken from the Jordan River and carried to Gilgal

#### 4:20b

**the twelve stones**

* the twelve stones they carried with them
* those twelve stones

**the twelve stones:** The phrase *the twelve stones* refers to the twelve stones that Joshua told the men to take out of the Jordan River.

#### 4:20c

**they had taken from the Jordan.**

* that they took from the Jordan River.
* which they carried from the Jordan River.

**they had taken from the Jordan:** The word *they* refers to the twelve men whom Joshua chose to take the stones from the middle of the river.

##### **General Comment on 4:20**

In this verse the object (the stones) comes first and the subject (Joshua) comes after the verb. This is a device used in the Hebrew language to emphasize the stones. If possible, use the natural grammar of your language to give emphasis to the stones.

**Then Joshua said to the Israelites:** Joshua spoke to all the people of Israel. Earlier in 4:6 he spoke only to the twelve chosen men.

#### 4:21b

**“In the future, when your children ask their fathers,**

* “The children of future generations may ask their parents,
* “When your children ask you in the future

**In the future, when your children ask their fathers:** The word *when* creates a subordinate clause. In some languages, it may be more natural to use an independent clause. For example:

> Years from now your children will ask you why these rocks are here. (CEV)

**your children:** The phrase *your children* refers to the present and future generations of Israelite children.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> your descendants

> your children and grandchildren

**ask their fathers:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *fathers* can refer to both mothers and fathers.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> When your children ask their fathers (ESV)

> When your children ask their parents (NRSV)

> In the future your children will ask (NLT)

#### 4:21c

**‘What is the meaning of these stones?’**

* ‘Why are these rocks here?’
* what these stones represent.

**What is the meaning of these stones?:** The children will ask the question *What is the meaning of these stones?* because they want to know why the stones are there. The children of future generations will see the stones and wonder why they are arranged as a memorial in that place.

#### 4:22a

**you are to tell them,**

* Then you must explain to them,
* Then you must tell them this:

**you are to tell them:** The clause *you are to tell them* indicates that the parents of the children must explain to them the meaning of the stones.

In some languages, the quote formula between 4:22a\-b may need to be made explicit. For example, you could say:

> Then you should explain it to your children. Say to them…

#### 4:22b

**‘Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.’**

* ‘The Israelites walked across the dry riverbed of the Jordan River.’
* ‘The Jordan River dried up so that the nation of Israel could walk across it.’

**Israel:** The term *Israel* refers to all the Israelite people.

**crossed:** The word *crossed* means that the Israelite people walked across the Jordan River.

**the Jordan:** The phrase *the Jordan* refers to the Jordan River. This phrase is more literally “this Jordan.” The word “this” probably adds emphasis: “this very Jordan River that you see before your eyes.” In some languages it is not natural to include the word “this.” Try to find a natural way to add emphasis. If you can’t find a natural way to do this, then translate it as “the Jordan River.”

**on dry ground:** The phrase *on dry ground* refers to the riverbed of the Jordan. This was dry because Yahweh made the river stop flowing.

## Joshua 4:23 (id: 515985)

### Section 4:1–5:1 The Israelites commemorated the crossing of the Jordan River

Twelve men from among the Israelites each took a stone from the middle of the Jordan River. With these stones Joshua built a monument to remind the Israelite people, and their descendants, about how God helped them cross the river.

#### 4:23a

**For the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you**

* Yahweh your God made the Jordan River stop flowing so that
* Yahweh your God made a dry path across the Jordan River in front of you

**For the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you:** It was Yahweh who made it possible for the people to cross the river. This theme of God’s deliverance continues throughout the book of Joshua as the Israelites move in to conquer the land.

**dried up:** The words *dried up* mean that Yahweh made the water stop flowing.

**the waters of the Jordan:** It may be more natural in some languages to translate the phrase *the waters of the Jordan* as “the Jordan River.”

#### 4:23b

**until you had crossed over,**

* you could walk across the river bed.
* and kept it dry until you walked across on it.

**until you had crossed over:** The phrase *crossed over* means that they walked across the riverbed. God held back the water until they were all across on the west bank of the Jordan.

#### 4:23c

**just as He did to the Red Sea,**

* He did this in the same way that he did when he parted the Red Sea.
* This was like when Yahweh made a path through the Red Sea.

**just as:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *just as* introduces a comparison.

**He did to the Red Sea:** This is a comparison. Yahweh rescued the Israelites many years ago at the Red Sea. In a similar way, he has rescued Israel once again at the Jordan River.

#### 4:23d

**which He dried up before us until we had crossed over.**

* He made a dry path for us to walk on until we crossed to the other side.
* He dried up a path through the sea for us until we walked across.

**which He dried up:** God made a path for the Israelites to cross the Red Sea by making the waters stand like a wall on each side of the path. This story is told in Exodus 14:21–22\.

**before us:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *before us* can also be translated as:

> on our behalf

> ahead of us (GW)

> as we watched (NLT)

These three aspects of meaning all make sense in the context, and it is hard to know which meaning is more in focus. You should translate this phrase with the meaning that is most natural in your language.

**until we had crossed over:** The phrase *until we had crossed over* indicates that God held the water back until all the Israelites walked across to the other side of the Red Sea.

* He did this so that every person in the whole world will know
* Because he has done this, every nation on the earth will understand

**so that all the peoples of the earth may know:** There is some implied information here. Yahweh did this so that all the people will know. For example:

> He has done this so that all the nations of the earth might recognize the Lord’s power (NET)

**so that:** The phrase *so that* indicates the reason why Yahweh dried up the Red Sea and the Jordan River.

**all the peoples of the earth:** The phrase *all the peoples of the earth* refers to all the nations that are in the world.

**may know:** The phrase *may know* indicates that everyone will know and understand that Yahweh is powerful.

#### 4:24b

**that the hand of the LORD is mighty,**

* that Yahweh is powerful.

**that:** The word *that* introduces the content of what all the peoples of the earth should know.

**the hand of the LORD is mighty:** The phrase *hand of the LORD is mighty* is a Hebrew idiom that to refers to Yahweh’s power. Translate this idiom in a way that is natural in your language. For example:

> Yahweh is powerful

> Yahweh has great power

#### 4:24c

**and so that you may always fear the LORD your God.”**

* And so that you will respect Yahweh your God and worship him forever.”
* He did this so that you will honor Yahweh your God forever.”

**so that you may always fear the LORD your God:** There is implied information here. Yahweh did this so that you will fear him.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> Yahweh did this so that you would fear him forever

**so that:** The phrase *so that* expresses purpose. It could also be translated “that” or “in order that.”

**fear the LORD your God:** The expression *fear the LORD* implies loyalty, respect, or honor of Yahweh. It means to be in awe of God’s greatness.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> honor the Lord your God (GNT)

> worship him (CEV)

> always obey the Lord your God (NET)

##### **General Comment on 4:21–24**

These verses repeat the theme that was introduced in 4:6–7\|. This repetition emphasizes the importance of this commemoration event, and the great deliverance performed by God. It also emphasizes the unity of the Israelites as a nation specially chosen by God.

### Paragraph 5:1

This paragraph tells the reaction of the Israelites’ enemies when they heard about the things that God had done for the Israelites.

#### 5:1a

**Now when all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan**

* ¶ All the Amorite kings who ruled the regions that were west of the Jordan River
* ¶ All the rulers of the Amor people who lived in the country west of the Jordan River

**Now when all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan:** There is a contrast between the reaction of the Israelites and the reaction of their enemies, the Amorites and Canaanites. When the Israelites saw what God had done, they respected and honored him, but their enemies were terrified. There may be a word or particle in your language that will help to emphasize that contrast.

**Amorite:** The *Amorite* people were people who lived in the hills in the land of Canaan west of the Jordan River.

Here is another way to translate this name:

> Amor people

**kings:** The word *kings* refers to the rulers of the small towns in the hills of Canaan. Each “king” ruled one town and the villages around it.

Here are some other ways to translate this word:

> rulers

> leaders

**west of the Jordan:** The phrase *west of the Jordan* refers to the land on the west side of the Jordan River.

#### 5:1b

**and all the Canaanite kings along the coast**

* and all the Canaanite kings who ruled the places on the seacoast
* and all the rulers of the Canaan people who lived near the sea heard about this.

**and all the Canaanite kings:** Here are some other ways to translate the word *kings*:

> rulers

> leaders

**the Canaanite:** The *Canaanite* people were people who lived in the land of Canaan west of the Jordan River.

Here is another way to translate this word:

> Canaan people

**along the coast:** The phrase *along the coast* refers to the Mediterranean Sea.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> who lived along the coast of the sea

> who lived near the Mediterranean Sea

#### 5:1c

**heard how the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the Israelites**

* heard that Yahweh made the Jordan River stop flowing for the Israelites.
* They heard that Yahweh made a dry path through the Jordan River.

**heard:** The Amorite and Canaanite kings heard that the Israelites had crossed the Jordan River.

**how the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan:** The main thing the kings heard was that *the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan*. They understood the significance of this. Now that the Israelites had crossed the river they were a threat to their safety, especially because a powerful God was helping them.

**before the Israelites:** There are two ways to understand the phrase *before the Israelites*:

1. God had acted on behalf of the people of Israel. For example:

    > the Lord had dried up the waters of the Jordan for the people of Israel (ESV) *(ESV, RSV, GNT, CEV, NLT)*

2. God had acted in the sight of the people of Israel. For example:

    > the Lord had dried up the Jordan before the Israelites (NIV) *(BSB, NIV, NET, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). This is followed by many English versions and by many commentaries.

#### 5:1d

**until they had crossed over,**

* They heard that they walked across to the other side.
* They heard that the Israelites walked over to the other side.

**until they had crossed over:** The phrase *until they had crossed over* indicates that God kept the Jordan River from flowing until the Israelites had walked across it.

**they:** There is a textual issue here.

1. The Hebrew Masoretic text reads: “until they had crossed over.” For example:

    > until they had crossed (NJB) *(BSB, NJB, RSV, CEV, ESV, GW, NAB, NASB, NCV, NJPS, NLT, GNT)*

2. An alternate reading in the Hebrew Masoretic text reads: “until we had crossed over.” For example:

    > until we had crossed over (NIV) *(NIV)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\). The standard Hebrew text, nearly all the English versions, and most commentaries follow option (1\).

#### 5:1e

**their hearts melted**

* Then they became very afraid
* Then they no longer had any courage

**their hearts melted:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *their hearts melted* is an idiom. It means that the kings were afraid. There may be an idiom in your language that expresses this meaning in a vivid way.

#### 5:1f

**and their spirits failed**

* and lost their courage to fight the people of Israel
* and they were terrified

**and their spirits failed:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *and their spirits failed* is an idiom. It means that the kings were afraid and lacked courage to fight against the Israelites.

The two idioms “their hearts melted” and *their spirits failed* mean the same thing. The Hebrew text uses two phrases to describe their fear to add emphasis to how fearful they were. In some languages, it may be helpful to combine the two idioms into one emphatic statement. For example, you could say:

> The kings were very frightened

Use a way that is natural in your language to emphasize their fear.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> The kings were very fearful and felt powerless to fight

#### 5:1g

**for fear of the Israelites.**

* because of what God did for the Israelites.
* and were afraid to fight the Israelites.

**for fear of the Israelites:** The phrase *for fear of the Israelites* indicates that they were fearful because of what God had done for the people of Israel. If this is not clear you might need to make this explicit. For example, you could say:

> because of what God had done for the Israelites

## Joshua 5:2 (id: 515989)

### Section 5:2–12 Joshua circumcised the men, and the Israelites observed Passover

Joshua circumcised the Israelite men, because they had not done this ceremony while they walked through the wilderness for forty years. Then the Israelites observed the Passover ceremony. They ate food from the land of Canaan, and God stopped sending them manna.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Circumcision of the next generation

> Circumcision and the first Passover in the promised land

#### 5:2a

**At that time the LORD said to Joshua,**

* ¶ Then Yahweh commanded Joshua:
* ¶ While the Israelites were in their camp at Gilgal, Yahweh told Joshua:

**At that time:** The phrase *At that time* refers to the time while the Israelites lived in their tents at Gilgal. This is the same time to which verse 5:1 refers.

**the LORD said:** Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> Yahweh told them

> Yahweh commanded them

#### 5:2b

**“Make flint knives and circumcise the sons of Israel once again.”**

* “Make knives from flint stones and do another ceremony to circumcise the men of Israel.”
* “Make stone knives and circumcise every man and boy who is not yet circumcised.”

**Make flint knives and circumcise the sons of Israel:** *flint* is a kind of stone that can be chipped until it forms a sharp edge. At this time humans were only just beginning to use iron, and flint knives were commonly used for cutting.

Here is another way to translate the term *flint knives*:

> stone knives

**circumcise:** The verb *circumcise* means to cut off the foreskin of a man’s penis. This ceremony was first mentioned in Genesis 17:9–14 when Yahweh told Abraham to circumcise the men in his household. This was a sign, or a mark, of the covenant that God made with Abraham.

If you have translated the New Testament you should translate the word *circumcise* the same way you did there. For example, see Luke 1:59\.

Consider whether you should use a euphemism or more general expression in your language to translate *circumcise*.

Here is another way to translate this word:

> cutting ceremony

**the sons of Israel:** Only male people were circumcised. Normally, boys were circumcised when they were eight days old. It may be clearer to translate this as:

> the men of Israel

> the men and boys of Israel

**once again:** The phrase *once again* means that this is the second time that the nation of Israel had performed the ceremony of circumcision. The Israelite men who lived in Egypt were circumcised as children, but that generation died while they walked through the wilderness. Now the men and boys who were born after the Israelites left Egypt must be circumcised. Normally, boys were circumcised when they were eight days old.

> Then Joshua made the knives

#### 5:3b

**and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibeath\-haaraloth.**

* and he circumcised the Israelite men and boys at Gibeath\-haaraloth.
* He circumcised them at the Hill of the Foreskins.

**and circumcised the sons of Israel:** The phrase *the sons of Israel* refers to the Israelite men who were not yet circumcised. Women were not circumcised.

**at Gibeath\-haaraloth:** The phrase *Gibeath\-haaraloth* is a Hebrew phrase meaning “hill of the foreskins.” It may be better to translate the meaning of this phrase. For example:

> Circumcision Hill (GNT)

> the hill of the foreskins (KJV)

If you transliterate the phrase Gibeath\-haaraloth, a footnote may be helpful. Here is a sample footnote:

> FOOTNOTE: Gibeath\-haaraloth means “hill of the foreskins”

**Now this is why Joshua circumcised them:** The phrase *this is why* refers ahead to verses 5:5–7 and adds emphasis. Choose a word or phrase that naturally indicates emphasis in your language. For example:

> Joshua had to circumcise them because (NLT)

> this is why it was necessary to circumcise them

#### 5:4b

**All those who came out of Egypt—all the men of war—**

* All the men who were soldiers when they left Egypt
* after the Israelites left Egypt, all the men old enough to fight

**All those who came out of Egypt—all the men of war:** The two phrases *All those who came out of Egypt* and *all the men of war* refer to the same group of people and can be translated by one phrase. For example:

> all the men old enough to serve in the army (NCV)

> all the soldiers (GW)

> all the men of military age (NIV)

**who came out of Egypt:** Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> After the Israelites left Egypt, all the men old enough to serve in the army (NCV)

> All the men who were old enough to fight in battle when they left Egypt (NLT)

#### 5:4c

**had died on the journey in the wilderness after they had left Egypt.**

* died in the wilderness after they left Egypt.
* died in the wilderness.

**had died on the journey in the wilderness:** The clause *had died on the journey in the wilderness* indicates that the men old enough to fight died while they walked through the wilderness.

**after they had left Egypt:** It may be redundant to translate this phrase in some languages because this information is already included in 5:4b.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 5:4

## Joshua 5:5 (id: 515995)

### Section 5:2–12 Joshua circumcised the men, and the Israelites observed Passover

Joshua circumcised the Israelite men, because they had not done this ceremony while they walked through the wilderness for forty years. Then the Israelites observed the Passover ceremony. They ate food from the land of Canaan, and God stopped sending them manna.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Circumcision of the next generation

> Circumcision and the first Passover in the promised land

#### 5:5a

**Though all who had come out were circumcised,**

* Even though the men who left Egypt were circumcised,
* The men who came out of Egypt were circumcised before they left Egypt,

**Though all who had come out were circumcised:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Though* is a connector to link verse 5a to 5b.

Here are some other ways to translate this word:

> although

> even though

> even though the men who left Egypt had been circumcised, the males born in the wilderness had not been circumcised

You should use the connector between these two clauses that is natural in your language.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> The men who left Egypt had been circumcised. However, the men born later…were not circumcised (GW)

> Those who left Egypt had been circumcised. But none of those born after the Exodus…had been circumcised (NLT)

**all:** The word *all* refers to all the male people who had left Egypt. It does not refer to women.

#### 5:5b

**none of those born in the wilderness on the journey**

* the men born later, on the way through the wilderness
* but all the boys born on the journey through the wilderness

The Hebrew word that the BSB leaves untranslated but the many English versions translate as “but” contrasts the men and boys who left Egypt with those who were born in the wilderness. Use a word that is natural in your language to show this contrast.

Here are some other ways to translate this word:

> yet

> however

**none of those:** The phrase *none of those* refers to all the boys who were born in the wilderness. It does not refer to the women. The word *none* refers to the males born after the Israelite people left Egypt. If the reference is not clear, you may wish to make it explicit. For example:

> The men who had come out of Egypt had been circumcised, but none of those who were born in the desert on the trip from Egypt had been circumcised. (NCV)

**in the wilderness:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *wilderness* refers to a place where no people live. Some English versions translate this word as “desert.”

**on the journey:** The phrase *on the journey* refers to the time that the Israelites wandered in the wilderness. These boys were born during that time.

#### 5:5c

**from Egypt had been circumcised.**

* after they left Egypt, never got circumcised.
* were not circumcised.

**from Egypt had been circumcised:** This phrase has been mentioned several times in previous verses, so it may be more natural to leave it implicit.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 5:5

## Joshua 5:6 (id: 515996)

### Section 5:2–12 Joshua circumcised the men, and the Israelites observed Passover

Joshua circumcised the Israelite men, because they had not done this ceremony while they walked through the wilderness for forty years. Then the Israelites observed the Passover ceremony. They ate food from the land of Canaan, and God stopped sending them manna.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Circumcision of the next generation

> Circumcision and the first Passover in the promised land

#### 5:6a

**For the Israelites had wandered in the wilderness forty years,**

* The Israelites walked through the wilderness for forty years
* The Israelites traveled in the wilderness for forty years.

**For:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *For* can also be translated as “because.” It connects verse 5 to verse 6, and it gives an explanation for what is stated in verse 5\. Many English versions do not translate this word, and the function is implied. You should use a connecting word that is natural in your language to connect these two verses.

**the Israelites had wandered in the wilderness forty years:** The Israelites walked from place to place in the wilderness. It took the Israelites forty years to reach Kadesh Barnea. Deuteronomy 1:2 states that they could have walked this distance in eleven days. The Israelites walked for forty years because they disobeyed Yahweh.

**in the wilderness:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *wilderness* refers to a place where no people live.

#### 5:6b

**until all the nation’s men of war who had come out of Egypt had died,**

* until all the soldiers who left Egypt died
* During that time all the men old enough to fight when they left Egypt died.

**until all the nation’s men of war:** This phrase refers to men more than twenty years old and old enough to be soldiers.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> until all the nation, that is, the men of war (NASB)

In many languages it may be more natural to combine the two phrases or to delete *all the nation’s*. For example:

> all their soldiers (GW)

> all the men who were old enough to fight in battle (NLT)

> the men in the army (CEV)

**who had come out of Egypt:** It was stated in the previous verse that they came out of Egypt, so it may be more natural in some languages to leave this information implicit.

#### 5:6c

**since they did not obey the LORD.**

* because they did not obey Yahweh.
* They died because they disobeyed Yahweh.

**since:** The word *since* introduces the reason why all these men died in the wilderness.

**they did not obey the LORD:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *obey* is literally “listen.” This is an idiom. It means “obey.”

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> they did not obey what Yahweh had commanded

##### **General Comment on 5:6a\-c**

It may be more natural in some languages to state the reason at the beginning of the sentence instead of at the end. You can reorder the verse so that 5:6c starts the verse. For example:

> 6cThe Israelites did not obey Yahweh. Because they disobeyed him, 6athey had to walk in the wilderness for forty years 6buntil all of Israel’s soldiers died.

#### 5:6d

**So the LORD vowed**

* Because they disobeyed him, Yahweh made a solemn promise to them.
* So, Yahweh vowed to them

**So the LORD vowed:** The clause *So the LORD vowed* means that Yahweh made a promise to them. It may be more natural in some languages to put the indirect object in its normal order. For example:

> the Lord had sworn to them (NIV)

Use whatever order is most natural in your language.

#### 5:6e

**never to let them see the land**

* He said he will not let them enter the land
* that they will not live long enough to see the land

**never to let them see the land:** The clause *never to let them see the land* indicates that Yahweh did not let them live long enough to enter the land of Canaan.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> he would not let them enter the land of Canaan

> he would not let them live to see the land of Canaan

#### 5:6f

**He had sworn to their fathers to give us,**

* which he promised their ancestors to give us,
* he swore to give to them and to us.

**He had sworn:** The phrase *He had sworn* means that Yahweh made a vow or a promise.

**to their fathers:** The phrase *to their fathers* refers to their actual fathers and also their ancestors.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> to their ancestors

> to their fathers and grandfathers

**to give us:** There is implied information. The phrase *to give us* can also be translated as:

> to give to us(incl) Israelites

The writer of the book of Joshua wrote this many years later. When he said *to give us* he wrote about himself and the Israelites in his own time. He said that they also received what God had promised to their ancestors.5:6 Bratcher and Newman, p. 62\.

Here is another way to translate this part of the verse:

> Yahweh did not let them see the land which he promised to their ancestors, and which he said that he would give to them and to us(incl)

#### 5:6g

**a land flowing with milk and honey.**

* a rich and fertile land.
* That land is a fertile land, and produces lots of crops.

**a land flowing with milk and honey:** The phrase *a land flowing with milk and honey* is a Hebrew idiom. In this idiom the rivers flow with milk and honey instead of water. It means that the land was fertile and produced abundant crops. If possible, use vivid language or an idiom which conveys the same meaning in your own language.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> a very fertile land

> a land which produces lots of crops

##### **General Comment on 5:4–6**

The structure of 5:4–6 is complex. Some English versions reorder these verses. If you find these verses difficult to translate, you might want to consider reordering them. For example:

> 4bWhen the people of Israel left Egypt, 5aall the males were already circumcised. 6aHowever, during the forty years the people spent crossing the desert, 5cnone of the baby boys had been circumcised. 6bAlso, by the end of that time all the men who were of fighting age when they left Egypt had died 6cbecause they had disobeyed the Lord. 6dJust as he had sworn, 6ethey were not allowed to see 6gthe rich and fertile land 6fthat he had promised their ancestors. (GNT)

If you follow the GNT, you will need to look at how it translates 5:7\. Verse 5:7 includes information that is implied at the beginning of the unit 5:4–6, specifically the statement about why these men had never been circumcised. Verse 5:7 in the GNT reads:

> The sons of these men had never been circumcised, and it was this new generation that Joshua circumcised. (GNT)

You might also want to consider the CEV, which reorders 5:4–7\.

### Section 5:2–12 Joshua circumcised the men, and the Israelites observed Passover

Joshua circumcised the Israelite men, because they had not done this ceremony while they walked through the wilderness for forty years. Then the Israelites observed the Passover ceremony. They ate food from the land of Canaan, and God stopped sending them manna.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Circumcision of the next generation

> Circumcision and the first Passover in the promised land

#### 5:7a

**And Joshua raised up their sons in their place,**

* Their sons were the people whom God chose to replace them.
* So, Joshua circumcised their sons, those who grew up in place of their fathers.

**And:** Verse 7 is a summary of verses 5–6\. The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *And* is a connector word. It shows the relationship between this verse and the preceding verses.

Here are some other ways to translate this word:

> That is why

> In light of that

> So, for that reason

You should translate this word with a connecting word or phrase that is most natural in your language.

**Joshua raised up their sons in their place:** The phrase *raised up their sons in their place* could mean that either God or *Joshua* allowed the sons of the men who had died to take their place. Although the BSB translates this clause as if *Joshua* raised up these people, most English versions follow the Hebrew and use the pronoun “he,” which can refer to either interpretation.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> he raised up their sons in their place (NIV)

> he replaced them with their sons (NET)

> their sons—those who had grown up to take their fathers’ places (NLT)

**raised up their sons:** The phrase *their sons* is the object of the sentence, and it is emphasized in the Hebrew text. The construction *raised up their sons* is a way of emphasizing *their sons* in English. You should choose a way that is natural in your language to emphasize this phrase.

**their sons:** The phrase *their sons* refers to the male children of the people who died in the wilderness because they disobeyed God. And *their sons* make up the same group of men as those referred to in verse 5:4a.

#### 5:7b

**and these were the ones he circumcised.**

* Joshua circumcised their sons
* Joshua circumcised these sons,

**these were the ones he circumcised:** The clause *these were the ones* refers to the words “their sons” in verse 5:7a. Joshua circumcised the sons of the men who died in the wilderness. It may be more natural to reorder the verse. You could put the relative clause next to the noun it modifies. For example, you could say:

> So, it was their children whom Joshua circumcised, those whom God had raised up instead of them

#### 5:7c

**Until this time they were still uncircumcised,**

* because they had not been circumcised before.
* for they had not yet been circumcised

**Until this time they were still uncircumcised:** It may be more natural in some languages to leave this clause implicit and untranslated, because the meaning is included in 5:7d. Consider whether such repetition is natural in your language.

#### 5:7d

**since they had not been circumcised along the way.**

* No one was circumcised while Israel walked through the wilderness.
* in the wilderness.

**since they had not been circumcised along the way:** The phrase *along the way* refers to the time that the Israelites walked through the wilderness for forty years.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 5:7

### Section 5:2–12 Joshua circumcised the men, and the Israelites observed Passover

Joshua circumcised the Israelite men, because they had not done this ceremony while they walked through the wilderness for forty years. Then the Israelites observed the Passover ceremony. They ate food from the land of Canaan, and God stopped sending them manna.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Circumcision of the next generation

> Circumcision and the first Passover in the promised land

#### 5:8a

**And after all the nation had been circumcised,**

* ¶ When all the men were circumcised
* ¶ When they finished circumcising all the men,

**And after all the nation had been circumcised:** Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> When all the Israelite men had been circumcised

> When they had finished circumcising all the men of Israel

**all the nation:** The phrase *the nation* refers to all the Israelite men. It does not refer to women.

#### 5:8b

**they stayed there in the camp**

* they stayed in the camp
* everyone stayed in the camp

**they stayed there in the camp:** The clause *they stayed there in the camp* indicates that all the Israelite males stayed in the place where they had set up their camp and did not go anywhere.

#### 5:8c

**until they were healed.**

* until they were healed.
* until the men were well again.

**until they were healed:** The clause *until they were healed* means until their wounds from the cutting of circumcision were healed and they were no longer sore.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Circumcision of the next generation

> Circumcision and the first Passover in the promised land

#### 5:9a

**Then the LORD said to Joshua,**

* Then Yahweh told Joshua:
* Then Yahweh said to Joshua:

**Then:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Then* signals the next event in the storyline. Use a connecting word in your language that shows that the next event in the story line is taking place.

**the LORD said to Joshua:** If it is necessary for this verb to have an explicit object, you can add “these words” or “this.” For example:

> Yahweh said these words to Joshua

#### 5:9b

**“Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.”**

* “Today I have taken the disgrace of being slaves in Egypt away from you.”
* “It was shameful for you to be slaves in Egypt. But now I have removed your shame.”

**Today:** The word *Today* means “this day” or “now.”

**I have rolled away:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *I have rolled away* is a Hebrew idiom. It means “to remove” or “to take away.”

**the reproach of Egypt from you:** The phrase *the reproach of Egypt* refers to the shame the Israelites suffered while they were slaves in Egypt. Being circumcised was the final step in their freedom from this shame.

The *reproach* does not mean that the Israelites could not be circumcised in Egypt.5:9 See the footnote in NET at verse 5:9 about “disgrace of Egypt.”

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> I have removed from you the disgrace of being slaves in Egypt (GNT)

> It was shameful for you to be slaves in Egypt. Now I have taken away your shame

#### 5:9c

**So that place has been called Gilgal to this day.**

* That is why they named that place Gilgal, the name it still has today.
* Because of this, Joshua gave that place the name Gilgal, which it is still named today.

**So:** The word *So* can also be translated:

> therefore

> for this reason

**that place has been called Gilgal:** The Israelites called this place Gilgal when they made their camp there. It was not yet a town at that time. Later it became a center of worship.5:9 Rasmussen, p. 236\. In some languages it may be more natural to say:

> that place is called Gilgal

> they named that place Gilgal

**that place:** The phrase *that place* refers to where the Israelites camped and were circumcised.

**Gilgal:** The name *Gilgal* sounds similar to the Hebrew word which means “to roll.” This is a pun on the idiom “I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.” If you have used the idiom “roll” in verse 9b you could include this information in a footnote. For example:

> FOOTNOTE: The name Gilgal sounds like the Hebrew word “roll”

**to this day:** The phrase *to this day* means “until now” or “until today” and refers to the time when the author was writing the book of Joshua.

#### 5:10a

**On the evening of the fourteenth day of the month,**

* On the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month,
* On the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month,

**On the evening:** The Israelites considered the evening to be the beginning of a new day. The *evening* was the beginning of the fourteenth day.

**of the fourteenth day of the month:** The phrase *the fourteenth day of the month* refers to the fourteenth day of the first month in the Jewish calendar. They crossed the Jordan River was on the tenth day of the first month (see 4:19a). They celebrated the Passover four days after they crossed the river.

#### 5:10b

**while the Israelites were camped at Gilgal**

* ¶ while the Israelites were still in the camp at Gilgal,
* ¶ the people of Israel continued to camp at Gilgal,

**while the Israelites were camped at Gilgal:** The clause *while the Israelites were camped at Gilgal* can also be translated:

> during the time that the Israelites set up their tents at Gilgal

#### 5:10c

**on the plains of Jericho,**

* in the plain in front of Jericho City,
* in the fields not far from Jericho,

**on the plains of Jericho:** The town of *Jericho* was about ten kilometers west of the Jordan River on the *plains*, a level area of land. This land extended from Jericho to the Jordan River. Gilgal was also on this plain, probably a few miles northeast of Jericho.

#### 5:10d

**they kept the Passover.**

* they celebrated the Passover feast.
* they ate the Passover feast.

**they kept the Passover:** The clause *they kept the Passover* indicates that the Israelites celebrated the Passover feast.

**Passover:** The Passover feast and the regulations about it are described in Exodus 12:1–20 and in Leviticus 23:4–8\. This feast reminded the Israelites of the time when God delivered them from being slaves in Egypt.

If you have translated the New Testament, you should translate the term the *Passover* the same way here. For example, see Matthew 26:2\.

#### 5:11a

**The day after the Passover,**

* The next morning, after they had celebrated the Passover,
* The next day after they ate the Passover feast,

The Hebrew word that the BSB leaves untranslated but the many other English versions translate as “And” signals the next event in the storyline.

**The day after:** The phrase *The day after* refers to the morning after the Israelites had eaten the Passover feast.

**the Passover:** It may be more natural in some languages to translate this phrase as a clause. For example:

> they ate the Passover feast

> they celebrated the Passover

#### 5:11b

**on that very day, they ate unleavened bread and roasted grain from the produce of the land.**

* they began to eat the crops that grew in that land. They made bread without yeast and roasted grain.

* Because they could eat things that grew in the land there,
* That morning, since they had food to eat from the land,
* After they started eating food from the land of Canaan

**And:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *And* signals the next event in the storyline.

**the day after:** The phrase *the day after* refers to the morning after the Israelites celebrated the Passover feast. This was the day that the Israelites began to eat food from the land of Canaan.

#### 5:13b

**he looked up and saw**

* he suddenly saw
* and he was surprised to see

**he looked up:** The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as *he looked up* is used to show that something unexpected is going to happen. It may not be natural in some languages to translate *he looked up* literally. Use an expression or grammatical device that shows that something surprising is going to happen. It is also possible to leave this phrase untranslated. For example:

> While Joshua was near Jericho, he suddenly saw a man (GNT)

> One day, Joshua was near Jericho when he saw a man (CEV)

**and saw:** The Hebrew expression that the BSB translates as *and saw* is another way that the Hebrew language focuses attention on what is going to happen next. You may have a similar expression in your language. It is also possible to leave this phrase untranslated.

#### 5:13c

**a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in His hand.**

* a man standing in front of him holding a sword.
* a man who stood in front of him with his sword in his hand.

Here is another way to translate this clause:

> a man stood in front of him

**with a drawn sword in His hand:** The phrase *with a drawn sword* means that he had taken the sword out of its sheath. It was in his hand and was ready to use.

#### 5:13d

> Joshua approached the man and said

#### 5:13e

**“Are You for us or for our enemies?”**

* “Are you on our side, or are you against us?”
* “Are you one of our friends, or are you an enemy?”

**Are You for us or for our enemies?:** Joshua asked this question to find out if the man would fight with the Israelites or against them. The word *enemies* means “adversaries.”

**for us:** With the phrase *for us* Joshua asked the man if he was a friend of the Israelites.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> one of our friends

> somebody one our side

**for our enemies:** With the phrase *our enemies* Joshua asked the man if he was an enemy of the Israelites.

> one of our enemies

### Section 5:13–6:27 Israel conquered Jericho by God’s power

The Israelites followed God’s instructions and marched around the wall of Jericho town. On the seventh day the wall of the town collapsed and they conquered the town. They killed everybody in it except for Rahab and her family.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The wall of Jericho fell

> The conquering of Jericho

#### 5:14a

**“Neither,” He replied.**

* The man said: “I am not on your side and I am not against you.
* Then that man answered Joshua: “No, I am not either one.

**Neither:** The man answered *Neither* to indicate that he did not fit into either of the groups that Joshua named. He is not an Israelite soldier and he is not an enemy soldier. It may be helpful to repeat the information from Joshua’s question. For example, you could say:

> No, I am not one of your friends, and I am not one of your enemies

**He replied:** The word *He* refers to the man who stood before Joshua.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> Then the man replied to Joshua

#### 5:14b

**“I have now come as Commander of the LORD’s army.”**

* I have come as the commander of Yahweh’s army.”
* I am here because I am the general of Yahweh’s army.”

**I have now come as Commander of the LORD’s army:** The man who appeared before Joshua identified himself as the *Commander of the LORD’s army*. Many commentators believe that this man was an angel. The phrase *LORD’s army* probably refers to the angels who help fight Yahweh’s battles. This commander came to take charge of the Israelite army. If Joshua and the Israelites obey the commander of Yahweh’s army, then they are also part Yahweh’s army, fighting on God’s side.

**I have now come:** The man told Joshua that he had come to Jericho to carry out his duty as the commander of Yahweh’s army. He came to accomplish God’s plan, not Israel’s.

**Commander:** A *Commander* of an army is the person in charge of the army.

Here are some other ways to translate this word:

> general

> leader

#### 5:14c

**Then Joshua fell facedown in reverence**

* Then Joshua bowed down and put his face to the ground,
* Joshua bowed down to the ground to show his respect.

**Then Joshua fell facedown in reverence:** The expression *fell facedown* means that Joshua bowed down and touched his forehead on the ground. He did this to show his respect for the leader of Yahweh’s army.

**fell facedown in reverence:** The action of bowing was a form of respect given to people, as well as to God. For example, in Genesis 23:7 Abraham bowed down out of respect to the Hittites, the local inhabitants of Canaan.

It is not clear whether the man in 5:13–15 is an angel or is Yahweh himself. You should avoid implying that Joshua worshiped an angel. If necessary you could say that Joshua bowed “with respect” or use the BSB’s *in reverence*. For example:

> Joshua bowed down to the ground to show his respect

#### 5:14d

**and asked Him, “What does my Lord have to say to His servant?”**

* and asked: “What command does my master have for me, his servant?”
* Then Joshua said: “I am your servant, sir. Tell me what to do.”

**and asked Him:** It may be more natural in some languages to begin a new sentence here. For example:

> Then he asked him

> Joshua asked the man

**What does my Lord have to say to His servant?:** Joshua spoke to the man in the third person. He did not use the second person pronoun “you.” In Hebrew, this choice of pronoun was a way to show respect. In some languages it may be clearer to use second person forms. For example:

> I am your servant, sir. What do you want me to do? (GNT)

There may be another grammatical form or particle that shows respect in some languages. Use a form that is natural in your language.

**my Lord:** The term *my Lord* is a term of respect. It is not the word Yahweh. Use a term that shows respect when speaking to a superior.

Here are some other ways to translate this term:

> my master

> my boss

**have to say to His servant:** The word *say* here means “command.” Joshua asked the man what he wanted him to do. It is also possible to translate this question as a statement as in the CEV:

> “I am your servant,” he said. “Tell me what to do.” (CEV)

**The Commander of the LORD’s army replied,**

* Then the commander of Yahweh’s army answered Joshua:
* Then he told Joshua:

**The Commander of the LORD’s army replied:** It may not be natural in some languages to repeat the whole phrase *The Commander of the LORD’s army* again. It may be more natural to refer to the *Commander* as “the man” or by the pronoun “he.” For example:

> he said to Joshua

> the man said to Joshua

#### 5:15b\-c

**Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy:** This command is the same as the one that God gave Moses in Exodus 3:5 when Moses stood before the burning bush.

#### 5:15b

**“Take off your sandals,**

* “Take your shoes off your feet,
* “Take off your sandals.

**Take off your sandals:** The command *Take off your sandals* means that Joshua must take off his shoes.

**sandals:** The people of that time wore *sandals* on their feet. If you have a word that means *sandals* in your language, it would be more accurate to use it. Otherwise the generic word “shoes” is appropriate.

#### 5:15c

**for the place where you are standing is holy.”**

* because the place where you are standing is holy.”
* This is a holy place.”

**for the place where you are standing is holy:** The place where Joshua is standing is *holy* because of the presence of the man, or the angel, who represents God. The word *holy* means that something or someone is set apart for God.

#### 5:15d

* And Joshua obeyed him.

**And Joshua did so:** Joshua obeyed the commander’s orders and took off his shoes.

#### 6:1a

**Now Jericho was tightly shut up**

* ¶ The gates of Jericho were closed securely
* ¶ The gates in the wall of Jericho City were locked up tight.

**Now:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *Now* introduces a parenthetical comment about Jericho.

**Jericho was tightly shut up:** The phrase *Jericho was tightly shut up* means that the gates in the wall around the town were closed so that they could not be opened from the outside.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> they closed the gates in the town wall

**Jericho:** *Jericho* was a town with a wall built around it for protection against its enemies.

**tightly shut up:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *tightly shut up* is more literally “was shutting and shut up.” This is an idiom. It means that the gates were locked securely.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> the gates were shut and locked securely

> the gates were locked/barred tightly

#### 6:1b

**because of the Israelites.**

* because the people were afraid of the Israelites.

* And Yahweh said to Joshua:

**And:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *And* introduces the next event in the storyline.

**the LORD said to Joshua:** In 5:14–15 the commander of Yahweh’s army spoke to Joshua. In chapter 6 Yahweh himself spoke to Joshua. It is recommended that you distinguish between these two names.

#### 6:2b

**“Behold, I have delivered Jericho into your hand,**

* “Look, I have given you(sing) Jericho
* “Pay attention, Joshua. I will help you capture Jericho City.

**Behold:** The command *Behold* is a way to call attention to the importance of what Yahweh told Joshua. You may have an idiom that emphasizes the importance of what someone is saying. Some English versions leave this word untranslated, and it may be more natural to do so in your language.

**I have delivered Jericho into your hand:** The clause *I have delivered Jericho into your hand* is an idiom. It means that Yahweh will help Joshua and the Israelites to conquer Jericho. You may have a similar idiom that expresses this idea. If there is no appropriate idiom, you should translate the meaning. For example:

> I will enable you(sing) to capture Jericho

> with my help you will conquer Jericho

#### 6:2c

**along with its king and its mighty men of valor.**

* with its king, and its brave soldiers.
* You(sing) will defeat the king and the strong fighting men.

**along with its king:** The phrase *its king* refers to the king of Jericho.

**Have seven priests carry seven rams’ horns**

**And when there is a long blast of the ram’s horn**

* After the seventh day’s walk, they must sound one long note on the trumpet.
* Then they are to blow a long sound on their horns.

**And:** The word *And* introduces the next command that Yahweh gave to Joshua. Many English versions use a temporal connector such as “then.”

Here is another way to translate this word:

> Then, when they make a long blast

Use a connecting word that is natural in your language.

**when there is a long blast:** On the seventh day, they are to walk around the town seven times, with the priests blowing their trumpets. After the seventh time around, they are to blow a long loud sound on their trumpets.

**of the ram’s horn:** The term *ram’s horn* refers to the trumpets that the priests blew. It may be more natural in some languages to leave this reference to the *ram’s horn* implicit, as in GNT:

> Then they are to sound one long note. (GNT)

#### 6:5b

**and you hear its sound,**

* As soon as you hear that trumpet sound,

**the wall of the city:** Jericho had a wall made of stone and brick built around it. It may be necessary to make this clear by adding the implicit information:

> the wall around the town

**will collapse:** The phrase *will collapse* means that the stones and bricks in the wall will fall apart and collapse onto the ground.

#### 6:5e

> the ark of Yahweh

> the ark of the covenant

If possible, use a way to add emphasis that is natural in your language.

* and more soldiers walked behind the ark.
* and some of the armed men walked after the ark.

**and the rear guard:** There was also a group of soldiers who walked behind the ark of Yahweh. This is the first time *the rear guard* has been mentioned. This is a characteristic of Hebrew narrative style, which adds new information bit by bit as the story progresses. If this method of adding new information is not natural in your language, it may be better to combine verses 8 and 9 and add the information in logical order, as the GNT does. See the General Comment on 6:8–9\.

**followed the ark:** The soldiers walked behind the priests who carried the ark. There is implied information here. The Hebrew text does not mention that there were priests who carried the ark. It may be helpful to make this information explicit in some languages. For example:

> and the rear guard came after the priests who were carrying the ark

##### **General Comment on 6:8–9**

It may be more natural in some languages to rearrange the information in verses 8–9 and mention the groups of people who are walking in their order. In this case, verses 8–9 may be combined, as GNT as done:

> 8aSo, just as Joshua had ordered, 9b,8b,8can advance guard started out ahead of the priests who were blowing trumpets; 8dbehind these came the priests who were carrying the Covenant Box, 9cfollowed by a rear guard. 9aAll this time the trumpets were sounding. (GNT)

**But Joshua had commanded the people:**

* But Joshua told the people:
* Joshua ordered the soldiers and the priests

**the people:** The words *the people* refers to the soldiers and the priests.

#### 6:10b

**“Do not give a battle cry or let your voice be heard;**

* “Don’t shout. Don’t let anybody hear your voice.
* not to shout, or make any noise,

**Do not give a battle cry or let your voice be heard:** The two clauses *Do not give a battle cry* and *let your voice be heard* have a similar meaning. This is a way to give an emphatic command to the soldiers that they must be silent until Joshua tells them to shout. You should translate this part of the verse with an emphatic expression in your language.

#### 6:10c

**do not let one word come out of your mouth until the day I tell you to shout.**

* Don’t say a single word.
* or let one word come out of their mouths

#### 6:10d

**Then you are to shout!”**

* On the day I tell you, then you can shout.”
* until the day that he told them to.

#### 6:10c\-d

**do not let one word come out of your mouth:** The clause *do not let one word come out of your mouth* emphasizes that the soldiers must not say anything. It may be more natural in some languages to combine 10b and c and use an emphatic idiom or particle to convey the same meaning. For example:

> 10bYou must not shout. 10cDon’t speak even one word. 10bRemain absolutely silent.

**until the day I tell you to shout. Then you are to shout!:** The term *the day* refers to the seventh day that they walked around the town. Yahweh instructed Joshua in 6:5 that on the seventh day the army must shout. If you have a word in your language for a shout that soldiers make, you should use it here. For example:

> give a war cry (NCV)

> shout the battle cry (CEV)

Find a natural way to express this in your language.

##### **General Comment on 6:10b\-d**

In the Hebrew text Joshua speaks with a direct quote. In some languages it may be more natural to use an indirect quote. For example:

> Joshua told the people not to shout or let their voices be heard, or let even one word come out of their mouths, until the day that he told them to shout

### Section 5:13–6:27 Israel conquered Jericho by God’s power

The Israelites followed God’s instructions and marched around the wall of Jericho town. On the seventh day the wall of the town collapsed and they conquered the town. They killed everybody in it except for Rahab and her family.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The wall of Jericho fell

> The conquering of Jericho

#### 6:11a

**So he had the ark of the LORD carried around the city,**

* So Joshua told them to take the ark of Yahweh around the city
* So the soldiers and the priests who carried the covenant box of Yahweh walked around the city

**So:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *So* introduces the next event in the storyline.

In this context, the word *So* also marks the result. Joshua obeyed God’s command and made the army walk around the town on the first day.

**he had the ark of the LORD carried around the city:** This clause has some implied information. It was not only *the ark of the LORD* but also the priests and the soldiers that walked around the town. It may be more natural in some languages to include this implicit information. For example:

> They obeyed Joshua’s orders and carried the chest once around the town (CEV)

**he:** The pronoun *he* refers to Joshua.

**carried around:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *carried around* means “to go around.”

#### 6:11b

**circling it once.**

* and they walked around it once.
* one time.

**circling it once:** On this first day they walked once around the town.

#### 6:11c

**And the people returned to the camp and spent the night there.**

* Then they returned to their camp and spent the night there.
* Then they went back to their camping place and slept there that night.

**And:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *And* introduces the next event in the storyline.

**the people returned to the camp and spent the night there:** After they walked once around the town, they returned to their camping place.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> they returned to their camp and slept there that night

The Israelites followed God’s instructions and marched around the wall of Jericho town. On the seventh day the wall of the town collapsed and they conquered the town. They killed everybody in it except for Rahab and her family.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The wall of Jericho fell

> The conquering of Jericho

#### 6:12a

**Joshua got up early the next morning,**

* ¶ The next morning Joshua, the soldiers, and the priests woke up early.
* ¶ Joshua got up early the next morning and took the army and the priests back to Jericho.

The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB leaves untranslated but many English versions translate as “Then” introduces the next event in the storyline. Introduce this event in a way that is natural in your language.

**Joshua got up early:** There is some implied information. Not only Joshua, but also the priests and the soldiers woke up early.

**got up early:** The expression *got up early* means that Joshua (and the army) woke up early in the morning.

In order to make clear the connection between 6:12a and 6:12b\-13, it may be helpful to include the implicit information that Joshua led his army back to Jericho for the second day. For example, you could add:

> to lead the priests and army back to Jericho for a second day

> and he took them back to Jericho

#### 6:12b

**and the priests took the ark of the LORD.**

* The priests carried the ark of Yahweh.
* The priests again picked up the covenant box of Yahweh.

**and:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *and* introduces the next event in the storyline.

**the priests took the ark of the LORD:** The clause *the priests took the ark* means that four of the priests picked up the ark to carry it around Jericho.

If you have included the implicit information mentioned in verse 6:12a, it may be necessary to begin a new sentence here.

### Section 5:13–6:27 Israel conquered Jericho by God’s power

The Israelites followed God’s instructions and marched around the wall of Jericho town. On the seventh day the wall of the town collapsed and they conquered the town. They killed everybody in it except for Rahab and her family.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The wall of Jericho fell

> The conquering of Jericho

#### 6:13a

**And the seven priests carrying seven rams’ horns**

* The seven priests who carried the seven trumpets made of rams’ horns
* The seven priests who each held a trumpet

**the seven priests carrying seven rams’ horns:** The phrase *the seven priests carrying seven rams’ horns* contains the same information as the similar phrase in 6:8b. You should translate this phrase in a similar way.

#### 6:13b

**kept marching ahead of the ark of the LORD**

* walked ahead of the ark of Yahweh
* again walked in front of the covenant box of Yahweh,

**kept marching:** The phrase *kept marching* means that they walked forward.

**ahead of the ark of the LORD:** The priests carried the trumpets and walked in front of the ark of Yahweh.

#### 6:13c

#### 6:13d

**The armed troops went in front of them**

* One group of soldiers walked ahead of the priests,
* Again, some of the armed men walked in front of the priests

**The armed troops went in front of them:** This repeats the information that is in 6:9a. You should translate this clause in a similar way.

#### 6:13e

**and the rear guard followed the ark of the LORD,**

* and another group walked behind those who were carrying the ark of Yahweh.
* and other armed men walked behind the covenant box of Yahweh.

**and the rear guard followed the ark of the LORD:** This repeats the information that was given in 6:9c. You should translate this in a similar way.

#### 6:13f

**while the horns kept sounding.**

* They blew on their trumpets without stopping.
* The priests blew on the trumpets all the time as they walked.

**while the horns kept sounding:** The clause *while the horns kept sounding* indicates that the priests did not stop blowing their trumpets while they walked around the town.

#### 6:14a

**So on the second day they marched around the city once**

* They walked around the city once on the second day,
* On the second day they again walked around the city one time

**So:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *So* introduces the next event in the storyline. Introduce this event in a way that is natural in your language.

**on the second day they marched around the city once:** The *second day* is like the first day. The priests with the ark and the soldiers walked around the town one time.

#### 6:14b

**and returned to the camp.**

* and then they returned to the camp.
* and then returned to their camp.

**and:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *and* introduces the next event in the storyline.

**returned to the camp:** After the priests and soldiers had walked around the town one time, they returned again to their camp and slept there.

#### 6:14c

**They did this for six days.**

* They did this every day for six days.
* They did the same thing for six days.

**They did this for six days:** The soldiers and priests walked around the town in the same way for six days, including the first day that was described in verse 6:11\.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 6:14

## Joshua 6:15 (id: 516040)

### Section 5:13–6:27 Israel conquered Jericho by God’s power

The Israelites followed God’s instructions and marched around the wall of Jericho town. On the seventh day the wall of the town collapsed and they conquered the town. They killed everybody in it except for Rahab and her family.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The wall of Jericho fell

> The conquering of Jericho

#### 6:15a

**Then on the seventh day, they got up at dawn**

* ¶ On the seventh day they woke up at dawn
* ¶ On the seventh day they got up at daybreak.

**Then on the seventh day, they got up at dawn:** This verse connects to the previous verse with a Hebrew phrase that the BSB indicates this with the word *Then*. The Hebrew phrase is literally “and it was.” It marks the next event in the storyline. If it is natural in your language to indicate the next event in the storyline here, then you should do so.

**they:** The pronoun *they* includes Joshua, the priests, and the army who walked around the town.

#### 6:15b

**and marched around the city seven times in the same manner.**

### Section 5:13–6:27 Israel conquered Jericho by God’s power

The Israelites followed God’s instructions and marched around the wall of Jericho town. On the seventh day the wall of the town collapsed and they conquered the town. They killed everybody in it except for Rahab and her family.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The wall of Jericho fell

> The conquering of Jericho

#### 6:16a

**After the seventh time around, the priests blew the horns,**

* The seventh time, while the priests were blowing a long sound on the trumpets,
* When they walked around the city the seventh time, the priests blew the trumpets for a long time.

**After:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *After* introduces the next event in the storyline.

**the seventh time around:** The phrase *the seventh time* refers to the seventh time that the priests and army walked around the town on the seventh day.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> The seventh time around (NET)

> On the seventh time they walked around the town

**the priests blew the horns:** There is an interpretation issue here. There are different views about the timing of blowing the trumpets and the shouting. This affects how we understand both 6:16 and 6:20\.

1. While the priests were blowing the trumpets the people started shouting. The trumpets and the shouts were nearly simultaneous. For example:

    > as the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said… (REB) *(REB, NLT, NASB, NIV, NJPS, GNT)*

2. The priests blew the trumpets first and then the people started shouted. For example:

    > when the priests had blown the trumpets, Joshua said… (ESV) *(BSB, ESV, RSV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). It is most likely that the blowing of the trumpets and the shouting were nearly simultaneous. The two sounds together made a loud noise that caused fear in their enemies.

#### 6:16b

**and Joshua commanded the people,**

* Joshua said to the army:
* While they blew, Joshua told the army:

**Joshua commanded the people:** You may need to add a time connector to make it clear that Joshua spoke while the priests were blowing the trumpets. For example:

> at the same time

**the people:** The phrase *the people* refers to the Israelite soldiers.

#### 6:16c

**“Shout! For the LORD has given you the city!**

* “Shout, for Yahweh will give the city to you!
* “Shout out, because Yahweh has helped us to capture the city!

**Shout:** It may be more natural in some languages to express the verb *Shout* as:

> shout loudly

**For the LORD has given you the city:** The clause *the LORD has given you the city* indicates that Yahweh will help the Israelites to capture the town. It is because of Yahweh’s power that the Israelite army will conquer Jericho, not through their own cleverness or strength.

**has given:** The grammatical form of the verb *has given* seems to indicate that the event has already happened. But at this point the event hasn’t yet happened. The verb form is used to express certainty. It is as if God already made it happen. It may be more natural in some languages to express this certainty in a different way. For example:

> The Lord will let you capture this town (CEV)

> Yahweh will most certainly give you victory over the town

**you:** It may be more natural in some languages to translate the pronoun *you* as “us.” Joshua was among those who captured the town.

### Section 5:13–6:27 Israel conquered Jericho by God’s power

The Israelites followed God’s instructions and marched around the wall of Jericho town. On the seventh day the wall of the town collapsed and they conquered the town. They killed everybody in it except for Rahab and her family.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The wall of Jericho fell

> The conquering of Jericho

#### 6:17a

**Now the city and everything in it**

* Everything in the city of Jericho
* The city and everything in it

**Now:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Now* introduces the next event in the storyline. You should use a connecting word that is natural in your language.

**the city and everything in it:** The phrase *the city and everything in it* includes living beings, both people and animals, and non\-living things.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> absolutely everything in the town

#### 6:17b

**must be devoted to the LORD for destruction.**

* must be totally destroyed, because it belongs to Yahweh.
* you must destroy, to show that it belongs to Yahweh.

**must be devoted to the LORD for destruction:** The Hebrew noun that the BSB translates as *devoted…for destruction* indicates that something is given to Yahweh. It cannot be used for ordinary purposes and so it must be destroyed.

**must be devoted:** The BSB uses a passive form *must be devoted* to translate this verb. The passive is a way that the English language uses to emphasize the object of an action. The emphasis is on the people, animals and other things in Jericho that will be destroyed. There are two ways to translate this passive verb:

* Use a passive verb. For example:

    > The city and everything in it must be totally destroyed as an offering to the Lord (GNT)

* Use an active verb. For example:

    > You must destroy the city and everything in it to show that it now belongs to the Lord (CEV)

Use the forms that are natural in your language.

#### 6:17c

**Only Rahab the prostitute and all those with her in her house will live,**

* Only Rahab the prostitute and everybody who is in the house with her will live,
* But you must protect Rahab the prostitute and all her family who are in her house.

**Only Rahab the prostitute and all those with her in her house will live:** The word *Only* indicates that Yahweh made only one exception to his command.

**Rahab the prostitute:** The word *prostitute* means “harlot.”

**and all those with her in her house:** The phrase *all those with her in her house* refers to Rahab’s extended family. In 2:1–21 Rahab hid the Israelite spies so that they could escape. She asked them to spare the lives of her and all her family.

#### 6:17d

**because she hid the spies we sent.**

* because she hid the spies that we(incl) sent into Jericho.
* We(incl) will let her live because she hid the men we sent to spy on the land.

**because she hid the spies we sent:** Rahab was rewarded because she helped the Israelites when she hid the spies.

**the spies:** The term *the spies* refers to the Israelite spies who learned about the town of Jericho in Joshua chapter 2\.

**we sent:** In 2:1 Joshua sent men to explore the land and the town of Jericho. By using the inclusive pronoun *we* Joshua includes all the Israelites in his action. He acted as their representative.

### Section 5:13–6:27 Israel conquered Jericho by God’s power

The Israelites followed God’s instructions and marched around the wall of Jericho town. On the seventh day the wall of the town collapsed and they conquered the town. They killed everybody in it except for Rahab and her family.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The wall of Jericho fell

> The conquering of Jericho

#### 6:18a

**But keep away from the things devoted to destruction,**

* It is important that none of you take any of the things that belong to Yahweh.
* But remember: do not take any of the things that I told you to destroy as an offering to Yahweh.

**But:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *But* marks a contrast. In 6:17 Yahweh said that the Israelite soldiers were not to kill Rahab and her family. But they are to destroy all the other things in the town.

**keep away from the things devoted to destruction:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *keep away* is an emphatic direct address to the Israelites. It stresses that it is important for the Israelite soldiers to obey Joshua’s (and Yahweh’s) command.

**keep away:** The phrase *keep away* means that the Israelite soldiers must be careful not to take for themselves the things that belong to Yahweh.

**the things devoted to destruction:** The phrase *the things devoted to destruction* includes the people, animals, and other things in the town that belong to Yahweh. The Israelites must offer these things to Yahweh by destroying them.

Translate 6:18a in a natural way in your language that emphasizes this command. For example:

> It is important that none of you take any of the things that belong to Yahweh

> But remember! You must be careful not to take for yourselves anything or any person that belongs to Yahweh

#### 6:18b

**lest you yourself be set apart for destruction. If you take any of these,**

* You(plur) must not be overcome by greed and take what belongs to Yahweh.
* Do not be tempted to take them for yourselves,

**lest you yourself be set apart for destruction:** There is a textual issue in the clause *lest you yourself be set apart for destruction*.

1. The Greek Septuagint reads “lest you should covet.” For example:

    > for fear that, moved by greed, you take something lying under the curse (NJB) *(NJB, NRSV, NIV, CEV, NAB, NASB, REB)*

2. The Hebrew text reads “lest you should devote to destruction.” For example:

    > lest when you have devoted them you take any of the devoted things (ESV) *(BSB, ESV, RSV, NCV, NJPS)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\). There is strong support for it among English versions, and in the Septuagint, and it makes better sense of the verse.

Some versions that are based on the Hebrew (option 2\) leave out the parts of the verse that are difficult to understand.

It may help to reorder the parts of this verse so that the meaning is clearer. See the General Comment at the end of 6:18\.

**If you take any of these:** The clause *take any of these* is the result of coveting.

**these:** The word *these* refers to things that were mentioned in 6:18a. It may be more natural to refer to them by a pronoun. For example, you could say:

> so that you are not tempted to take them for yourselves

#### 6:18c

**you will set apart the camp of Israel for destruction and bring disaster upon it.**

* If you do, you will bring disaster and destruction on Israel.
* or the Israelite people will be destroyed.

**you will set apart the camp of Israel for destruction:** The result of taking the “devoted things” is that the whole Israelite camp would also become part of what must be destroyed.

**and bring disaster upon it:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *bring disaster* can also be translated as:

> bring trouble

> cause a calamity

**it:** The pronoun *it* refers to the “camp of Israel” and all the Israelite people.

##### **General Comment on 6:18**

In some languages it may help to reorder the parts of this verse. For example:

> 18bAnd you must beware of coveting anything that is forbidden under the ban; 18ayou must take none of it for yourselves, 18cor else you will put the Israelite camp itself under the ban and bring disaster on it. (REB)

> 18aBe careful not to take anything, 18bbecause of your greed, 18athat is devoted to Yahweh for destruction. 18cIf you do, you will also bring disaster and destruction on Israel.

**For all the silver and gold and all the articles of bronze and iron are holy to the LORD;**

* But all the silver and gold and the things made of bronze and iron belong to Yahweh.
* But you should not destroy the silver and the gold, or anything made of bronze or iron. Instead you should set them apart for Yahweh.

**For:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *For* introduces some exceptions to the things that the Israelites must destroy.

**all the silver and gold and all the articles of bronze and iron are holy to the LORD:** The *silver and gold and all the articles of bronze and iron* are exceptions to what they are to destroy. The implied information is that they are not to destroy these items, but they are to set them aside for Yahweh.

**the articles of bronze and iron:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *articles* refers to all handmade items, including containers, tools, and decorative things.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> things made of bronze and iron

**holy to the LORD:** The phrase *holy to the LORD* means that these things were set apart for Yahweh. They belong to him alone.

#### 6:19b

**they must go into His treasury.”**

* You must put them into Yahweh’s treasury.”
* Put them in the storehouse where Yahweh’s things are kept.”

**they must go into His treasury:** The clause *they must go* means that the Israelites are to put these objects into the treasury. For example, you could say:

> You must put these objects of metal into the treasury of Yahweh.

**His treasury:** The term *His treasury* refers to the storehouse where the things used for worship ceremonies were kept. They were probably kept in or near the Tent of Meeting. (See Numbers 31:54\)6:19 See Woudstra, p. 114\.

Here is another way to translate verse 19:

**So when the rams’ horns sounded, the people shouted.**

* So the people shouted, and the priests blew the trumpets.
* So they obeyed Joshua. They shouted loudly and the priests blew the trumpets.

**So:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *So* indicates that the action in this verse is done in response to Joshua’s instructions in 6:16–19\.

**when the ram’s horn sounded, the people shouted:** These two actions happened at the same time.

**the rams’ horns sounded:** Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> the priests blew the trumpets

#### 6:20b

**When they heard the blast of the horn, the people gave a great shout,**

* When they heard the trumpets, the people shouted loudly
* As soon as they heard the priests blow the trumpets, the people gave a loud shout

**When they heard the blast of the horn, the people gave a great shout:** These two actions happened at the same time. The words to describe them here and in 6:20a are in a different order.

##### **General Comment on 6:20a\-b**

Although the BSB and the Hebrew text of 6:20a\-b make it appear that the people shouted twice, this is unlikely.6:20 See Bratcher and Newman, p. 79\. It is recommended that you reorder this verse in a way that makes clear that the people only shouted once. The trumpet blast and the shout happened together.

Here are some other ways to translate this verse:

> When the people heard the sound of the rams’ horns, they shouted as loud as they could. (NLT)

> So the troops shouted very loudly when they heard the blast of the rams’ horns, (GW)

#### 6:20c

**and the wall collapsed.**

* and the walls fell down.
* and the wall of Jericho collapsed.

#### 6:20d

**Then all the people charged straight into the city**

* The soldiers ran straight up into the city
* The Israelite soldiers went straight uphill into the city

**Then:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Then* indicates that the Israelite soldiers could enter the town as a result of the wall falling down. Use a connecting word that is natural in your language.

Here is another way to translate this Hebrew word:

> so that (RSV)

**all the people charged straight into the city:** The clause *the people charged straight into the city* indicates that the soldiers entered the town to conquer it.

**straight into the city:** Jericho was built at the top of a hill or a mound. The soldiers went *straight* into the city.

#### 6:20e

**and captured it.**

* and so they captured the city.
* and they conquered it.

**and captured it:** The clause *and captured it* indicates that the Israelite soldiers defeated the soldiers of Jericho and captured the town.

##### **General Comment on 6:16–20**

In 6:16b\-c, Joshua gave the command to shout, and in 6:20 the army shouted. In 6:17–19 Joshua gives instructions about the capture of Jericho. But 6:17–19 seems unusual and may be a parenthesis between 6:16 and 6:20\. It may be that these instructions had already been given to the army, but the author repeats them in summary form here. This was the time for the army to carry out these commands.

* They destroyed everything in the city with their swords.
* They killed everyone in the city.

The Hebrew word that the BSB leaves untranslated but many English versions translate as “Then” introduces the next event in the storyline.

**At the edge of the sword:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *At the edge of the sword* is more literally “with the mouth of the sword.” This is a Hebrew idiom. It means that they killed the people and animals.

Here is another way to translate this Hebrew idiom:

> they killed everyone…they even killed every cow, sheep, and donkey (CEV)

**Meanwhile, Joshua told the two men who had spied out the land,**

* ¶ Earlier, Joshua told the two men who were spies in Jericho:
* ¶ Joshua already told the two men who went to learn about Jericho:

**Meanwhile, Joshua told:** Joshua told the two men to go and rescue Rahab. This is something he had previously told them to do. There are several ways to make this clear:

* Use the past perfect tense or the equivalent in your language: For example:

    > Joshua had told the two men who had spied out the land

* Use a word or particle that indicates that this action happened previously.
* Supply the implied information that Rahab and her family were not killed in verse 6:21b. For example:

    > They killed everyone, men and women, young and old, everyone except Rahab and the others in her house. (CEV)

Choose a way that is most natural in your language.

**the two men who had spied out the land:** This phrase refers to the two men who went to find out things about the town of Jericho in Chapter 2\.

**the land:** The phrase *the land* refers to Jericho and the country around it.

#### 6:22b

**“Go into the house of the prostitute and bring out the woman**

* “Go(dual) into the prostitute’s house. Bring her out
* “Go into Rahab’s house, and rescue her

**Go into the house of the prostitute:** The phrase *the house of the prostitute* refers to the house of Rahab the prostitute. If it is not appropriate in your language to use the term *prostitute* repeatedly, it is possible to translate this as:

> go into Rahab’s house

**bring out the woman:** It may be more natural in some languages to use either the proper name Rahab, or else refer to her by a pronoun. For example:

> bring Rahab out

> bring her out

#### 6:22c

**and all who are with her,**

* along with all her family,
* and her family.

**and all who are with her:** The phrase *all who are with her* refers to Rahab’s family members who were with her in the house.

#### 6:22d

**just as you promised her.”**

* because you(dual) made a promise to her.”
* You promised her that you will do this.”

**just as you promised her:** The clause *just as you promised her* states the reason that the men must go into Rahab’s house and rescue her. They had promised her that they would do this.

**promised:** The word *promised* can also be translated as “swore.” The men promised to Rahab in 2:12–14 that they would rescue her and her family when they conquered the town.

##### **General Comment on 6:22**

In some languages it may be more natural to reorder the parts of this verse. For example:

> 22aMeanwhile, Joshua said to the two spies, 22d“Keep your promise. 22bGo to the prostitute’s house and bring her out, 22calong with all her family.” (NLT)

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 6:22

## Joshua 6:23 (id: 516055)

### Section 5:13–6:27 Israel conquered Jericho by God’s power

The Israelites followed God’s instructions and marched around the wall of Jericho town. On the seventh day the wall of the town collapsed and they conquered the town. They killed everybody in it except for Rahab and her family.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The wall of Jericho fell

> The conquering of Jericho

#### 6:23a

**So the young spies went in**

* So the two young men who were the spies went into the house
* So the two men went into Rahab’s house.

**So the young spies:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *the young spies* refers to young, unmarried men.

**went in:** It may be more natural in some languages to include the implied information:

> went into Rahab’s house

#### 6:23b

**and brought out Rahab,**

* and led Rahab out.
* They brought out Rahab

**and brought out Rahab:** They brought Rahab out of the house.

#### 6:23c

**her father and mother and brothers, and all who belonged to her.**

* They brought out her father and mother and brothers and all her relatives.
* and her father, mother, brothers, and all the other relatives who were with her.

**her father and mother and brothers, and all who belonged to her:** There are two ways to understand the phrase *all who belonged to her*.

1. It refers to Rahab’s other relatives. For example:

    > all her kin (NAB) *(NAB, NJPS, GW, NLT, CEV)*

2. It refers to Rahab’s slaves. For example:

    > family and slaves (GNT) *(GNT)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). The Hebrew text does not mention Rahab’s slaves. If the phrase *belonged to her* implies ownership (such as owning a slave) in your language, then it would be better to make the meaning clear. For example, you could say:

> her father, her mother, her brothers and her other relatives

Many English versions translate it literally and leave its meaning unclear.

#### 6:23d

**They brought out her whole family**

* They brought out her entire family
* They took all her family

**They brought out her whole family:** The clause *They brought out her whole family* is a summary statement that emphasizes that they rescued her entire family. For example:

> They moved her whole family to a safe place (NLT)

**her whole family:** The phrase *her whole family* refers to her extended family. This refers to the people listed in 6:23c, and not a different group of relatives.

#### 6:23e

**and settled them outside the camp of Israel.**

* and led them outside the Israelite camp.
* to a place outside the camp of Israel where they could be safe.

**and settled them outside the camp of Israel:** The men found a safe place for Rahab and her family to stay *outside the camp of Israel*. Rahab and her family could not enter the Israelite camp because they were not ceremonially clean. The Israelite camp was a holy place and only Israelites could enter it.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 6:23

## Joshua 6:24 (id: 516058)

### Section 5:13–6:27 Israel conquered Jericho by God’s power

The Israelites followed God’s instructions and marched around the wall of Jericho town. On the seventh day the wall of the town collapsed and they conquered the town. They killed everybody in it except for Rahab and her family.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The wall of Jericho fell

> The conquering of Jericho

#### 6:24a

**Then the Israelites burned up the city and everything in it.**

* The Israelite army burned down the city. They burned everything in it,
* Then they burned the whole city and everything in it.

**Then the Israelites:** The phrase *the Israelites* refers to the Israelite army, not to the two men who led Rahab’s family to safety.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> Then the army burned the town

**burned up the city:** For example:

> But they burned the town and all that was in it (NET)

**and everything in it:** The Israelite soldiers killed every person and animal in the town. They then burned all the bodies and everything else that was still there.

#### 6:24b

**However, they put the silver and gold and articles of bronze and iron**

* except the silver and gold and the things made of bronze and iron.
* They only saved the silver and the gold, and the things made of bronze and of iron.

**However, they put the silver and gold and articles of bronze and iron:** The only other exception to the ban besides Rahab’s family are these items.

**articles of bronze and iron:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *articles* refers to all handmade items, including containers, tools, and decorative things.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> things made of bronze and iron

#### 6:24c

**into the treasury of the LORD’s house.**

* They put these things into Yahweh’s treasury.
* They put them in the storehouse at the Tent of Meeting.

**into the treasury of the LORD’s house:** The term *treasury* refers to the storehouse where the things used for worship ceremonies were kept. They were probably kept in or near the Tent of Meeting.

**the LORD’s house:** The term *the LORD’s house* is another name for the Tent of Meeting, the place where the Israelites worshiped Yahweh.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 6:24

## Joshua 6:25 (id: 516059)

### Section 5:13–6:27 Israel conquered Jericho by God’s power

The Israelites followed God’s instructions and marched around the wall of Jericho town. On the seventh day the wall of the town collapsed and they conquered the town. They killed everybody in it except for Rahab and her family.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The wall of Jericho fell

> The conquering of Jericho

#### 6:25a

**And Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, with her father’s household and all who belonged to her,**

* But Joshua allowed Rahab the prostitute and her family to escape death.
* But Joshua spared the lives of Rahab and all her relatives.

**And Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, with her father’s household and all who belonged to her:** The clause *Rahab the prostitute, with her father’s household and all who belonged to her* is the object of the sentence. The Hebrew text puts this first for emphasis. Use the natural grammatical patterns of your language to give this emphasis.

**And Joshua spared:** The clause *Joshua spared* indicates that Joshua did not allow the soldiers to kill Rahab along with the other people of Jericho.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> Joshua saved alive (RSV)

The two spies brought Rahab and her family to safety outside of Jericho. However, Joshua was the person who had authority and told them to do this.

**her father’s household and all who belonged to her:** The phrase *her father’s household and all who belonged to her* refers to Rahab’s extended family. This is the same group of people referred to in 6:23\.

#### 6:25b

**because she hid the men Joshua had sent to spy out Jericho.**

* She was spared because she hid the spies whom Joshua sent to look around Jericho.
* She lived because she hid the two spies that Joshua sent into Jericho.

**because she hid the men Joshua had sent to spy out Jericho:** The word *men* refers to the two young spies.

**to spy out Jericho:** The phrase *to spy out Jericho* indicates that Joshua sent the two men to Jericho to learn about the town and the surrounding area.

#### 6:25c

**So she has lived among the Israelites to this day.**

* And she has lived in Israel to this day.
* She and her family became a part of the people of Israel.

**So she has lived among the Israelites:** The family of Rahab and her descendants became part of the nation of Israel. There is an interpretation issue with the Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *she has lived*.

1. It refers to Rahab. For example:

    > she has lived in Israel to this day (ESV) *(BSB, ESV, RSV, NIV, NASB, NET, NJPS, NLT, KJV)*

2. It refers to Rahab’s descendants. For example:

    > her descendants have lived in Israel to this day (GNT) *(GNT, NABRE, NRSV, CEV)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\). This agrees with the Hebrew text and is followed by many English versions and by Bible commentaries.6:25 See, for example, Woudstra, p. 115, and Dallaire, p. 899\.

**to this day:** The phrase *to this day* refers to the time that the book of Joshua was written. The descendants of Rahab were still living among the Israelites at the time the author wrote the book.

##### **General Comment on 6:25**

In some languages it may be more natural to reorder the parts of this verse. The Hebrew text separates the reason clause (6:25c) from the result clause (6:25a) and these can be put together. For example:

> 25aBut Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, with her family and all who belonged to her, 25cbecause she hid the men Joshua had sent as spies to Jericho—25band she lives among the Israelites to this day. (NIV)

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 6:25

## Joshua 6:26 (id: 516061)

### Section 5:13–6:27 Israel conquered Jericho by God’s power

The Israelites followed God’s instructions and marched around the wall of Jericho town. On the seventh day the wall of the town collapsed and they conquered the town. They killed everybody in it except for Rahab and her family.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The wall of Jericho fell

> The conquering of Jericho

### Paragraph 6:26

This paragraph is a final statement about the destruction of Jericho. Even the land that Jericho is built upon is devoted to Yahweh for destruction. The town was to be left for Yahweh only. Anybody who disobeyed Yahweh would be punished.

#### 6:26a

**At that time Joshua invoked this solemn oath:**

* ¶ After they destroyed Jericho, Joshua made this oath:
* ¶ At that time Joshua made this curse:

**At that time:** The phrase *At that time* refers to the time after the Israelites defeated Jericho. For example:

> After Jericho was destroyed… (CEV)

**Joshua invoked this solemn oath:** The clause *Joshua invoked this solemn oath* means that Joshua warned the Israelites.6:26 The people probably answered “Amen,” or “Yes, I will do it.” Woudstra, p. 116\.

**invoked this solemn oath:** The expression *invoked this solemn oath* can be expressed in many ways. For example:

> Joshua made this solemn declaration (NET)

> Joshua issued a solemn warning (GNT)

> Joshua pronounced this curse (REB)

**solemn oath:** A *solemn oath* is a promise, declaration, or warning.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Joshua laid an oath upon them at that time, saying, “Cursed before the Lord… (RSV)

> After Jericho was destroyed, Joshua said this curse. He said to them, “Yahweh will punish…

#### 6:26b

**“Cursed before the LORD is the man who rises up and rebuilds this city, Jericho;**

* “Whoever starts to rebuild Jericho city, Yahweh will curse them.
* “Yahweh will punish anyone who tries to rebuild this city of Jericho.

**Cursed before the LORD is the man:** The phrase *Cursed before the LORD is the man* indicates that Yahweh will curse anyone who rebuilds Jericho.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> Yahweh will punish anybody who rebuilds Jericho

**man:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *man* is more literally “person.” (In other contexts the word can mean a “male person.”) You should use a word such as “person” or “anyone.”

**who rises up and rebuilds:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *rises up* refers to the beginning of an action.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> anybody who starts to rebuild

> the person who tries to rebuild

**this city, Jericho:** The words *this city* and *Jericho* refer to the same place.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> Jericho town

#### 6:26c

**at the cost of his firstborn he will lay its foundations;**

* Their oldest son will die when they lay the foundation of the city wall.
* The one who lays the foundation of the city will lose his oldest son.

**at the cost of his firstborn:** The phrase *at the cost of his firstborn* means that if anyone lays the foundation of the town of Jericho, their oldest son will die.

**he will lay its foundations:** The word *foundations* refers to the foundation of the town wall.

In some languages it may be clearer to reorder the parts of 6:26c. For example:

> If anyone lays the foundation for the town wall, that person’s oldest son will die.

#### 6:26d

**at the cost of his youngest he will set up its gates.”**

* Their youngest son will die when they set up the city gates.”
* The one who sets up the gates will lose his youngest son.”

**at the cost of his youngest:** The phrase *at the cost of his youngest* means if he sets up its gates, his youngest son will die.

**he will set up its gates:** The *gates* refer to the gates in the town wall.

In some languages it may be clearer to reorder the parts of 6:26d. For example:

> If anyone sets up the gates to the town, that person’s youngest son will die.

#### 6:27b

**and his fame spread throughout the land.**

* and Joshua was famous in all of Canaan.
* and everyone in that country knew about his great deeds.

#### 6:27

**So the LORD was with Joshua:** The clause *So the LORD was with Joshua* indicates that Yahweh stayed with Joshua and helped him in everything that he did.

**and his fame spread throughout the land:** The clause *his fame spread throughout the land* indicates that everyone in the land of Canaan heard about Joshua and the things that he did.

## Joshua 7:1 (id: 516066)

### Section 7:1–26 Achan sinned and God punished him

Achan disobeyed God. He took some of the things from Jericho that God told them to destroy. Because of his sin, the Israelites lost the battle against the town of Ai. Yahweh showed the Israelites that Achan was the one who had sinned, and they punished Achan.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The defeat at Ai

> Achan’s sin

### Paragraph 7:1

Yahweh was angry with Israel because Achan disobeyed Yahweh’s command.

#### 7:1a

**The Israelites, however, acted unfaithfully**

* ¶ But the Israel people did not keep their promise
* ¶ But the Israelites did not obey Yahweh.

**The Israelites, however:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *however* indicates a contrast with what precedes it in chapter 6\. The contrast compares Yahweh’s command not to take any devoted things and Achan’s disobedience of that command.

**The Israelites:** Even though only one man took something, God considered all *The Israelites* to be guilty.

**acted unfaithfully:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *acted unfaithfully* means that the Israelites were not faithful to Yahweh. They disobeyed Yahweh by taking some of the devoted things.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> the Israelites did not keep their promise to Yahweh

> the Israelites did not obey the Lord (NCV)

#### 7:1b

**regarding the things devoted to destruction.**

* about the things set apart for Yahweh.
* Yahweh told them to destroy everything in Jericho, but they did not destroy everything.

**regarding the things devoted to destruction:** The phrase *regarding the things devoted to destruction* can also be translated “about the devoted things.” In 6:17–18 Yahweh told the Israelites to destroy everything in Jericho. In that way they would give these things to Yahweh. See how you translated the phrase *things devoted to destruction* in 6:18\.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> about the things that must be destroyed

> about the things that belong to Yahweh

#### 7:1c

**Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of what was set apart.**

* A man from the clan of Judah named Achan took some of the things that must be destroyed. Achan’s father was Carmi. His grandfather was Zabdi, and his great\-grandfather was Zerah.
* Achan took some of the things that belonged to Yahweh. Achan was the son of Carmi, the grandson of Zabdi, the great\-grandson of Zerah, from the clan of Judah.

The Hebrew word that the BSB leaves untranslated but some English versions translate as “for” introduces an explanation of the way that the Israelites disobeyed Yahweh. Many English versions do not include this conjunction. Do whatever is most natural in your language.

**Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah:** This means that Carmi was the son of Zabdi, and that Zabdi was the son of Zerah.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> Achan was the son of Carmi, the grandson of Zabdi, and the great\-grandson of Zerah

> Achan was the son of Carmi and grandson of Zabdi, and belonged to the clan of Zerah, a part of the tribe of Judah (GNT)

**Zabdi:** There is a textual issue with the word *Zabdi*.

1. The Hebrew text says “Zabdi.” *(BSB, RSV, GNT, REB, NCV, NASB, NET, GW, NJPS, NJB, KJV)*
2. The Septuagint translation into Greek says “Zimri.” *(NIV, NLT)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\). It is best to follow the Hebrew text unless there are strong reasons to take a different reading.

**took some of what was set apart:** This means that Achan stole some of the things that belonged to Yahweh.

#### 7:1d

**So the anger of the LORD burned against the Israelites.**

* So Yahweh was very angry at the Israelites.
* Because Achan did that, Yahweh was furious with the people of Israel.

**So:** The Hebrew prefix that the BSB translates as *So* introduces the next event in the storyline. Some versions do not translate this word. Introduce this next event in a way that is natural in your language.

God’s anger in 7:1d is the next event, and it is also the result of 7:1a\-c. Some English versions express this as a result.

Here are some ways to express result:

> therefore

> and so (GNT)

You can express this connector as either introducing the next event, or as introducing a result.

**the anger of the LORD burned against the Israelites:** The phrase *the anger of the LORD burned* is a Hebrew idiom. It means that:

> Yahweh was very angry at the people of Israel

##### **General Comment on 7:1**

In some languages it may be more natural to reorder the parts of this verse. For example:

> 1aBut Israel violated the instructions 1babout the things set apart for the Lord. A man named Achan had stolen some of these dedicated things, 1dso the Lord was very angry with the Israelites. 1cAchan was the son of Carmi, a descendant of Zimri son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah. (NLT)

## Joshua 7:2 (id: 516068)

### Section 7:1–26 Achan sinned and God punished him

Achan disobeyed God. He took some of the things from Jericho that God told them to destroy. Because of his sin, the Israelites lost the battle against the town of Ai. Yahweh showed the Israelites that Achan was the one who had sinned, and they punished Achan.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The defeat at Ai

> Achan’s sin

### Paragraph 7:2–5

Joshua sent the Israelite army to fight against the men of Ai, but the Israelites were defeated.

#### 7:2a

**Meanwhile, Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai,**

* ¶ Joshua sent men from Jericho to the city of Ai,
* ¶ Joshua sent some Israelite men from where they were camped near Jericho City, to go to Ai City.

**Meanwhile:** The Hebrew text has a word that introduces the next event in the storyline. The BSB translates it as *Meanwhile*, but some English versions do not translate this word. Some English versions begin this verse with the connector “now.” Introduce this next event in a way that is natural in your language.

**Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai:** The *men* that Joshua sent were Israelites. They were not people of Jericho. The Israelites were camped near Jericho following the battle. The NLT makes this clear:

> Joshua sent some of his men (NLT)

**Ai:** *Ai* is the name of a town. It was smaller than Jericho.

#### 7:2b

**which is near Beth\-aven to the east of Bethel,**

* which is near Beth\-aven City, east of Bethel City.
* Ai is near Beth\-aven City and east of Bethel City.

**which is near Beth\-aven to the east of Bethel:** These are the names of small towns. Ai was near the town of *Beth\-aven* and was east of the town of *Bethel*.7:2 “Beth\-aven (“house of evil”) often appears as an insulting nickname for Bethel, which means “house of God.” Some scholars consider “near Beth\-aven” to be an editorial gloss. Others, however, take it to be a variant spelling of “Bethon” (Bratcher and Newman, p. 319\).

#### 7:2c

**and told them, “Go up and spy out the land.”**

* He said to them: “Go up and find out about the land.”
* Joshua told the men to go and look at Ai and the area around it.

**and told them:** Joshua gave the men instructions before he sent them to Ai. The Hebrew text uses a direct quote for Joshua’s instructions. Some English versions put these brief instructions into an indirect quote.

The NET has a direct quote:

> and instructed them, “Go up and spy on the land” (NET)

The GNT has an indirect quote:

> Joshua sent some men…with orders to go and explore the land (GNT)

Use the kind of quotation that is most natural in your language.

**Go up:** Ai was at a higher elevation than the Israelite camp. Hebrew verbs keep track of elevation, and thus it says *Go* *up*. If your language does not keep track of elevation, it may be more natural to say “go.”

**and spy out the land:** The phrase *spy out the land* means “look at the land and learn about it.” Joshua wanted to know information that would help him to plan an attack on Ai.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> find out whatever you can (CEV)

**land:** The word *land* refers to both the town of Ai and to the land that surrounded it.

#### 7:2d

**So the men went up and spied out Ai.**

* So the men went up and found out about Ai.
* So the men did so.

**So:** The Hebrew connector that the BSB translates as *So* indicates that 7:2d is the result of 7:2c. Use a natural way to indicate result in your language.

**the men went up and spied out Ai:** This clause indicates that the men obeyed Joshua’s instructions. In some languages it may not be natural to repeat the information again. If that is true in your language, you may express the idea in a different way. For example:

> so they did it

> so the men obeyed Joshua

**went up:** See the note on “go up” in 7:2c.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 7:2

## Joshua 7:3 (id: 516069)

### Section 7:1–26 Achan sinned and God punished him

Achan disobeyed God. He took some of the things from Jericho that God told them to destroy. Because of his sin, the Israelites lost the battle against the town of Ai. Yahweh showed the Israelites that Achan was the one who had sinned, and they punished Achan.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The defeat at Ai

> Achan’s sin

### Paragraph 7:2–5

Joshua sent the Israelite army to fight against the men of Ai, but the Israelites were defeated.

#### 7:3a

**On returning to Joshua, they reported,**

* When they returned they said to Joshua:
* Then they went back to Joshua and said to him:

The Hebrew word that the some English versions translate as “and” introduces the next event in the storyline. Use a natural way in your language to indicate this connection. Here is one way that you could translate this transition:

> when (GNT)

**On returning to Joshua, they reported:** It may be helpful in some languages to include the implied information. For example:

> After they spied out the land they returned to Joshua, and said to him

#### 7:3b

**“There is no need to send all the people;**

* “Not all the people need to go up to fight Ai.
* “It is not necessary for our whole army to attack the city of Ai.

**There is no need to send all the people:** This clause expresses a suggestion from the men who looked at Ai. They suggested that it was not necessary for the whole army to fight against Ai.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> There is no need for everyone to attack Ai. (GNT)

> Do not send the whole army to attack Ai.

**all the people:** The phrase *all the people* refers to the soldiers of Israel.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> all the fighting men

> the whole army

#### 7:3c

**two or three thousand men are enough to go up and attack Ai.**

* Only two to three thousand men should go to attack Ai.
* Send only two or three thousand soldiers.

**two or three thousand men are enough to go up and attack Ai:** The spies suggested that two or three thousand men were enough to defeat the town of Ai. Translate this suggestion in a way that is natural in your language.

**two or three thousand men:** The whole army of Israel was about 40,000 men. The spies suggested that only a small number out of the whole army should go. It may be helpful to include a word that indicates this comparison. For example:

> Send only two or three thousand men to fight (NCV)

**go up:** In some languages it may be necessary to indicate the location along with this verb of motion. For example:

> Not all the people will have to go up against Ai (NIV)

The Hebrew uses the verb *go up* because the town of Ai was at a higher elevation than the Israelite camp. The soldiers went uphill to the town of Ai to attack it. In some languages it may be more natural to use a simple verb like “go.”

**attack Ai:** The BSB follows the Hebrew text and includes the phrase *attack Ai* at the end of 7:3c. In some languages, it may be more natural to put these words at the end of 7:3b, as the GNT does. For example:

> There is no need for everyone to attack Ai. Send only about two or three thousand men (GNT)

#### 7:3d

**Since the people of Ai are so few,**

* Because the city of Ai is not large,
* Because not many people live there,

**Since:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Since* introduces the reason for the preceding clause.

**the people of Ai are so few:** This phrase refers to the people of Ai.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> There are not many people in Ai

> Ai is not a large town

> There are not many men to defend Ai

#### 7:3e

**you need not wear out all our people there.”**

* do not make the entire army work their way up there and get tired.”
* you will not need to make the whole army work hard to defeat that small place

**you need not wear out all our people there:** There are two ways to interpret the Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *wear out*.

1. It means “to work hard” or “become weary from working hard.” For example:

    > Don’t tire out the whole army (NET) *(BSB, NET, RSV, NIV, GW, REB, ESV, NASB, NLT)*

2. It means “to cause trouble for.” For example:

    > Why bother the whole army (CEV) *(CEV, NJPS)7:3 Some English versions (NCV, NLT96, GNT) leave this word unstated or implied.*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). Although the meaning is somewhat uncertain, this is the interpretation followed by the majority of English versions.

**all our people:** This refers to all the army, or all the fighting men.

##### **General Comment on 7:3**

In some languages it may be more natural to state the grounds before the result. English versions have done this in various ways. For example:

> 3eThere are only a few people in Ai, 3bso we will not need all our people to defeat them. 3cSend only two or three thousand men to fight. 3dThere is no need to send all of our people. (NCV)

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 7:3

## Joshua 7:4 (id: 516071)

### Section 7:1–26 Achan sinned and God punished him

Achan disobeyed God. He took some of the things from Jericho that God told them to destroy. Because of his sin, the Israelites lost the battle against the town of Ai. Yahweh showed the Israelites that Achan was the one who had sinned, and they punished Achan.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The defeat at Ai

> Achan’s sin

### Paragraph 7:2–5

Joshua sent the Israelite army to fight against the men of Ai, but the Israelites were defeated.

#### 7:4a

**So about three thousand men went up,**

* So about three thousand Israelite men went to attack Ai.
* Then Joshua agreed and sent about three thousand soldiers to attack Ai City.

**So:** The BSB inserts the word *So*, which is not found in the Hebrew text. This introduces the result of the advice in 7:3d. Many English versions introduce this result with the word “so.”

Consider what is the most natural way in your language to indicate a result connection.

**about three thousand men went up:** This clause implies that Joshua sent the three thousand men to Ai, as the spies suggested. In some languages it may be more natural to make this explicit. For example:

> Joshua sent about three thousand soldiers to attack Ai (CEV)

Notice that the CEV included the reason why the men went to Ai, that is, to attack. It may be helpful to make that clear in your translation in some way.

**men:** The word *men* indicates “from among the Israelite army.” Only three thousand Israelite soldiers went to Ai. Some English versions omit this phrase because it is implied by the context.

**went up:** The town of Ai was at a higher elevation than the Israelite camp at Gilgal. The Hebrew language keeps track of elevation, and thus has the word *up*.

#### 7:4b

**but they fled before the men of Ai.**

* But the Israelites had to retreat from the soldiers of Ai.
* But the soldiers of Ai defeated them and the Israelites ran away.

**but:** The Hebrew prefix that the BSB translates as *but* introduces the next event in the storyline. Mark this next event in a way that is most natural in your language.

Many English versions use a contrastive connector such as *but* or “however” to show that what happened next is contrary\-to\-expectation. For example:

> but they were routed by the men of Ai (NIV)

Translate this contrary\-to\-expectation relation in a way that is most natural in your language.

**they fled before the men of Ai:** The Hebrew text implies that the Israelites attacked Ai. The men of Ai defeated the Israelites so that the Israelites ran away from the battle. In some languages it may be helpful to make some of this information explicit. For example:

> When the soldiers arrived at Ai, they attacked the town. The men of Ai defeated them and they ran from the battle

**they:** The word *they* refers to the three thousand Israelite men.

**fled:** The word *fled* indicates that the Israelite army had to run away from the people who were defending Ai.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> they turned back

> they ran away

**the men of Ai:** This phrase refers to the men who lived in Ai and were defending it against the Israelites. Because they were fighting a battle they could be called:

> the soldiers of Ai

## Joshua 7:5 (id: 516073)

### Section 7:1–26 Achan sinned and God punished him

Achan disobeyed God. He took some of the things from Jericho that God told them to destroy. Because of his sin, the Israelites lost the battle against the town of Ai. Yahweh showed the Israelites that Achan was the one who had sinned, and they punished Achan.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The defeat at Ai

> Achan’s sin

### Paragraph 7:2–5

Joshua sent the Israelite army to fight against the men of Ai, but the Israelites were defeated.

#### 7:5a

**And the men of Ai struck down about thirty\-six of them,**

* The soldiers of Ai killed about thirty\-six Israelite soldiers.
* The soldiers of Ai City killed thirty\-six of the Israelites altogether.

**And:** The Hebrew prefix that the BSB translates as *And* introduces the next event in the storyline. Introduce the next event in a way that is most natural in your language.

**the men of Ai:** The phrase *the men of Ai* refers to the soldiers who were fighting to defend the town.

**struck down about thirty\-six of them:** The soldiers of Ai killed thirty\-six Israelite soldiers.7:5 The Hebrew text has a word that the BSB translates as “about.” However, Boling and Wright note that this word is emphatic in verses 4 and 5\. So the number of men killed was precisely thirty\-six (Boling and Wright, p. 222\).

#### 7:5b

**chasing them from the gate**

* They chased the soldiers away from the gate in the city wall,
* They chased the Israelite army away from the entrance to the city,

The Hebrew prefix that the BSB leaves untranslated but some English versions translates as “and” introduces some additional detail about the death of the Israelite soldiers. This adds emphasis to the defeat of the Israelites. The details specify where and when the Israelite soldiers were killed.

**chasing them:** The word *them* refers to the Israelite soldiers.

**from the gate:** The word *from* means “in front of.” The men of Ai chased the Israelite soldiers away from the area in front of the town gate all the way to the stone quarries.

**the gate:** Ai town (like Jericho town) was surrounded by a town wall. In the wall was a *gate*, and people could enter the town only through this gate.

#### 7:5c

**as far as the quarries**

* and chased them as far as the stone quarries.
* and down the hill to the stone quarries

**as far as the quarries:** There are two ways to interpret the Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *quarries*.

1. It means rock quarries. For example:

    > They chased the Israelites from the city gate as far as the stone quarries (NIV) *(BSB, NIV, CEV, GW, NCV, NET, NLT, REB, GNT)*

2. It is a place named Shebarim. For example:

    > pursued them from the town gate as far as Shebarim (NJB) *(NJB, RSV, ESV, NASB, NJPS)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). Interpretation (2\) is a transliteration of the Hebrew word and does not communicate the meaning as it was probably understood in Hebrew.

**quarries:** The word *quarries* refers to a place where people dig rock from the ground to use in construction.

#### 7:5d

**and striking them down on the slopes.**

* They killed them while they fled down the hill.
* and killed the Israelites as they ran down the hill.

**and:** The Hebrew prefix that the BSB translates as *and* introduces more details of where and when the Israelite soldiers were killed.

**striking them down:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *striking them down* means “killing.” The phrase *striking them down* refers to the thirty\-six Israelite soldiers who were killed. It restates the information in 7:5a. It does not indicate that additional Israelites were killed.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> the men of Ai killed them

**on the slopes:** The phrase *on the slopes* refers to the hillside going down to the stone quarries.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> on the slope of the hill

> while they were fleeing down the hill

##### **General Comment on 7:5b\-d**

This story is told in a way that is common in Hebrew narrative style. It tells a summary of an event first, and then it adds the details. Use the natural grammar of your language to make this clear. Your readers should understand that only thirty\-six Israelite people were killed. These are some ways that English versions have handled this style:

> The men of Ai killed about thirty\-six of them, chasing them from outside the gate as far as Shebarim and killing them on the slope. (GW)

> The men of Ai chased them from the city gate as far as some quarries and killed about thirty\-six of them on the way down the hill. (GNT)

#### 7:5e

**So the hearts of the people melted and became like water.**

* The Israelite soldiers were very afraid and felt dread instead of courage.
* Then the Israelite army was very afraid.

**So the hearts of the people melted and became like water:** This is a Hebrew idiom. It means that the people became very afraid. They no longer felt any courage. Many languages have their own idioms to express fear. Here are some English idioms that express this meaning:

> And the heart of the troops sank in utter dismay. (NJPS)

> they lost their courage (NCV)

> The Israelites were paralyzed with fear at this turn of events, and their courage melted away. (NLT)

In some languages it may be more natural to express the meaning directly without using an idiom. For example, you could say:

> The Israelite soldiers were very afraid

Express the meaning in the most natural way in your language.

**the people:** This phrase refers to the Israelite soldiers.

## Joshua 7:6 (id: 516075)

### Section 7:1–26 Achan sinned and God punished him

Achan disobeyed God. He took some of the things from Jericho that God told them to destroy. Because of his sin, the Israelites lost the battle against the town of Ai. Yahweh showed the Israelites that Achan was the one who had sinned, and they punished Achan.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The defeat at Ai

> Achan’s sin

### Paragraph 7:6–9

Joshua asked Yahweh why he allowed the people of Ai to defeat the Israelites.

#### 7:6a

**Then Joshua tore his clothes**

* ¶ Then Joshua tore his clothes to show his sorrow.
* ¶ When the soldiers returned to the camp and told Joshua, he tore his clothes to show his sorrow.

**Then:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Then* introduces the next event in the storyline. There is some implied information here. The Israelite soldiers returned to their camp and told Joshua what happened in the battle. In some languages it may be clearer to make this information explicit. For example:

> When the soldiers returned to camp and reported to Joshua, he tore his clothes

**Joshua:** In the Hebrew text *Joshua* is mentioned alone as the subject of the sentence. Later in the verse, the elders of Israel also acted along with Joshua. This is a way to emphasize Joshua because he was the leader, and his reaction was the most important.

In some languages it may be more natural to include the elders of Israel as part of the subject. For example:

> Joshua and the elders of Israel tore their clothes

**tore his clothes:** The phrase *tore his clothes* means that Joshua intentionally tore his clothes open. This dramatic action was a way to express grief or sorrow. Joshua ripped open his upper and under garment in front of his chest, as a symbol of the pain in his heart.7:6 This dramatic action was an expression of heartfelt grief. TWOT says that he tore both outer and inner garments (p. 816\). Holladay’s lexicon defines this word as “to tear, to tear in pieces.” However, Bratcher and Newman says this was “probably only a tear along the edge of the outer garment” (p. 89\). This seems unlikely because it is difficult to make a small tear along the edge of a garment with only the bare hands. It is recommended that you translate this as tearing his clothes completely open.

It may be helpful to make the reason for this action explicit. For example:

> tore their clothes in grief (GNT)

#### 7:6b

**and fell facedown**

* He lay face down on the ground
* He lay down with his face toward the ground

**and fell facedown:** Joshua lay down on the ground with his face downward. The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *fell* means that Joshua deliberately lay down on the ground. This was one of the ways that he showed his humility and sorrow.

#### 7:6c

**before the ark of the LORD until evening,**

* in front of the ark of Yahweh until evening came.
* in front of the covenant box of Yahweh until the sun set.

**before:** The word *before* indicates “in front of” the ark.

**the ark of the LORD:** *the ark of the LORD* was a wooden box that represented the presence of Yahweh among the people. You should use the same word for *ark* as you did in 3:3\.

**until evening:** Joshua lay this way until the sun set.

#### 7:6d

**as did the elders of Israel;**

* The elders of Israel were with him on their faces in front of the ark.
* Joshua did this with the leaders of Israel.

**as did the elders of Israel:** The Hebrew is an ellipsis. In many languages it may be necessary to express it in a different way. For example:

> he and the elders of Israel all did this

> The leaders of Israel did the same thing. (NCV)

> The elders of Israel also did these things along with Joshua.

The Hebrew text puts this reference to the elders at an unusual place in the verse. In some languages it may not be natural to keep the order of the Hebrew text. Some English versions include the elders, along with Joshua, as the subject of the sentence in 7:6a. For example:

> 6aJoshua and the leaders of Israel tore their clothes in grief (GNT)

Express this in a way that is natural in your language.

**the elders of Israel:** The *elders of Israel* were older men who were the leaders of Israel.

#### 7:6e

**and they all sprinkled dust on their heads.**

* Joshua and the elders threw dirt onto their heads.
* They sprinkled dust on their heads.

**and they all sprinkled dust on their heads:** It was the custom for people to put dust on their heads to show sorrow. In some languages the reason for this action must be made explicit. For example:

> with dust on their heads to show their sorrow (GNT)

**sprinkled:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *sprinkled* is more literally “to cause to go up.” The precise action that the people used is not clear. Some English versions translate this word as “threw” (REB, NCV, NET). Choose a word that seems natural in your language.

**dust:** The word *dust* can also be translated as “dirt.”

##### **General Comment on 7:6**

In some languages it may be more natural to change the order of some of the information in this verse. There is more than one way to do this. Here are two examples:

> 6aJoshua 6dand the leaders of Israel 6atore their clothing in dismay, 6ethrew dust on their heads, 6band bowed down 6cfacing the Ark of the Lord until evening. (NLT)

> 6aThen Joshua 6dand the leaders of Israel 6cwent to Yahweh’s Covenant Box. 6aThey tore their clothes 6eand put dirt on their heads to show their grief. 6bThen they threw themselves down 6cin front of the Covenant Box and lay there with their faces to the ground until sunset.

## Joshua 7:7 (id: 516076)

### Section 7:1–26 Achan sinned and God punished him

Achan disobeyed God. He took some of the things from Jericho that God told them to destroy. Because of his sin, the Israelites lost the battle against the town of Ai. Yahweh showed the Israelites that Achan was the one who had sinned, and they punished Achan.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The defeat at Ai

> Achan’s sin

### Paragraph 7:6–9

Joshua asked Yahweh why he allowed the people of Ai to defeat the Israelites.

#### 7:7a

**“O, Lord GOD,”**

* “O, Lord Yahweh,
* “Yahweh who is the ruler of everything. This is terrible.

The Hebrew word that the BSB leaves untranslated but some English versions translate as “And” introduces the next event in the storyline.

The Hebrew begins this clause with a word that some English versions translate as “Alas.” It is an expression of dismay.

Here is another way to translate this word:

> This is terrible

Choose an exclamation or a way to show dismay or grief. In some languages it may be more natural to omit this word, as many English versions do (for example, BSB, GNT, NCV, NLT, GW).

**O:** The word *O* is an English “vocative” that marks the person who is being spoken to. This word was added by the BSB and is not the translation of a Hebrew word. Many English versions do not use this word. Use a natural form in your language to indicate that Joshua is speaking to God.

**Lord GOD:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Lord* here means “master” or “boss.” It is a title that shows respect. It is not the name Yahweh.

The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *GOD* is “Yahweh.” It is God’s personal name. When it is used alone, it is often translated “LORD” or “Lord” by English versions.

There are several ways to translate the phrase *Lord GOD*. For example:

* Use God’s name, “Yahweh,” along with a title of respect. For example:

    > master Yahweh

    > sovereign Yahweh

    > almighty Yahweh

* Use God’s name, “Yahweh,” with a descriptive phrase. For example:

    > Yahweh who is the ruler of everything

Use an appropriate form in your language. See the section on “Translating the Names of God” in the Introduction.

#### 7:7b

**Joshua said,**

* Joshua prayed,
* Joshua called out to Yahweh as he lay there.

**Joshua said:** In 7:7–9 Joshua expressed his grief in an emphatic complaint to Yahweh. He asked rhetorical questions that showed his confusion about what happened at Ai. In some languages it may be more natural to use a different verb instead of *said*.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> Joshua prayed (NET)

> Joshua shouted out

#### 7:7c

**“why did You ever bring this people across the Jordan**

* “why did you bring us(excl) across the Jordan River?
* “Surely this was not your purpose when brought us, your people, across the Jordan River.

**why did You ever bring this people across the Jordan:** This is a rhetorical question. It functions as a complaint or an expression of regret. Joshua regretted that Yahweh brought them across the Jordan River, because the people of Ai defeated them. He implies that it is God’s fault that they were defeated.

Here are two ways to translate this complaint:

* Use a rhetorical question. For example:

    > Sovereign Lord, why did you bring us across the Jordan River if you are going to let the Amorites kill us? (NLT)

    > Our Lord, did you bring us across the Jordan River just so the Amorites could destroy us? (CEV)

* Use a statement or exclamation. For example:

    > Surely you did not bring us(excl) across the Jordan River so that the Amorites could defeat us!

Translate this in a way that is natural in your language for expressing a complaint.

**You:** The pronoun *You* means “you” and is singular. Joshua is speaking to God.

**ever:** The Hebrew expression that the BSB translates as *ever* is an idiom. It emphasizes Joshua’s complaint. Use a natural way in your language to emphasize a complaint like this.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> why did you bring this people across the Jordan just to hand us over to the Amorites to be destroyed? (REB)

**this people:** The phrase *this people* refers to the Israelites. Joshua is also one of the Israelites. In some languages this must be made explicit. For example:

> bring us (NLT)

> bring us(excl) your people

#### 7:7d

**to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites**

* Did you want the Amorites to conquer us,
* Surely you did not want the Amor people to defeat us.

**to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites:** The Hebrew expression that the BSB translates as *deliver us into the hand of the Amorites* is an idiom. It means “let the Amorites gain control of us.” It indicates that the Amorites would conquer the Israelites.

**us:** The word *us* refers to the Israelites. It is exclusive.

> us(excl)

**the Amorites:** The name *Amorites* can be used in two senses. It can refer to a group of people who lived in the hills of Canaan where the town of Ai was. It can also be a synonym for the word “Canaanite,” to refer to all the people of Canaan. This is the way it is used here.

The English language uses the suffix “ites” to refer to a group of people.

Here is another way to translate this word:

> the Amor people

#### 7:7e

**to be destroyed?**

* and destroy us?
* You did not want them to kill us all.

**to be destroyed:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *to be destroyed* often means “to be killed.” Joshua feared that the Amorites would kill the Israelites.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> to let the Amorites kill us? (NLT)

#### 7:7f

**If only we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan!**

* If only we had decided to stay east of the Jordan River and live there.
* We should have stayed on the other side of the Jordan River.

**If only we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan:** Joshua expressed regret about what happened. He wished that they had stayed on the other side of the Jordan River. He thought that if they had stayed there, they would not have been defeated by the Amorites.

A regret is a wish that something in the past could have been different. Languages have different ways to express regret. Here are some examples in English:

> I wish we had stayed

> We should have stayed

> Why didn’t we just stay (GNT)

> This wouldn’t have happened if we had agreed to stay (CEV)

Express Joshua’s regret in a natural and emphatic way in your language.

**content to stay:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *content* can be translated as:

> willing to dwell

> decided to dwell

**the other side of the Jordan:** This phrase refers to the east side of the Jordan River.

##### **General Comment on 7:7**

7:7c\-e is a long rhetorical question in the BSB. In some languages it may be more natural to separate it into two or three different parts. For example:

> Almighty Lord, why did you bring these people across the Jordan River? Was it to hand us over to the Amorites so that they could destroy us? (GW)

> Why did you bring us(excl) across the Jordan at all? Did you want to give us to the Amorites? Did you bring us across only to destroy us?

Use a natural option for your language.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The defeat at Ai

> Achan’s sin

### Paragraph 7:6–9

Joshua asked Yahweh why he allowed the people of Ai to defeat the Israelites.

#### 7:8a

**O Lord, what can I say,**

* O Lord, what should I say to you
* My master, I do not know what to say about this.

**O:** The word *O* is an English “vocative” that marks the person who is being spoken to. This word was added by the BSB and is not the translation of a Hebrew word. Many English versions do not use this word. Use a natural form in your language to indicate that Joshua is speaking to God.

**Lord:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Lord* means “master” or boss.” It is a title that shows respect. It was also used in 7:7b when Joshua addressed God as “Lord God.”

**what can I say:** This is a rhetorical question. It functions as a part of Joshua’s complaint to Yahweh. Joshua did not yet understand why God allowed the people of Ai to defeat Israel.

Here are two ways to translate this complaint:

* Use a rhetorical question. For example:

    > What can I say, O Lord? (GNT)

* Use a statement. For example:

    > Lord, there is nothing I can say now (NCV)

    > I do not know what to say to you about this

Translate this in a way that in natural in your language for expressing a complaint.

#### 7:8b

**now that Israel has turned its back and run from its enemies?**

* now that the army of Israel has run away from their enemies?
* The army of Israel has fled from their enemies.

**now that:** The Hebrew expression that the BSB translates as *now that* introduces the topic that Joshua would say something about.

Here are some other ways to translate this connection:

> What can I say about the fact that Israel has turned their backs?

> What can I say, O Lord, now that Israel has retreated from the enemy? (GNT)

> I don’t even know what to say to you, since Israel’s army has turned and run from the enemy (CEV)

**Israel:** The word *Israel* refers to the army of Israel.

Here is another way to translate this word:

> since Israel’s army has turned and run from the enemy (CEV)

**has turned its back and run from its enemies:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *has turned its back* is an idiom. It means that they turned and ran away. They had to run away, because they were defeated by their enemies.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> what can I say about this situation? The army of Israel ran away from our enemies

> what can I say now that Israel has fled from its enemies? (NLT)

> what can I say now that Israel has retreated before its enemies? (NET)

**enemies:** The word *enemies* refers to the people of Ai.

##### **General Comment on 7:8**

In some languages it may be more natural to change the order of 7:8a and 7:8b. For example:

> 8bNow that Israel has turned and run from its enemies in defeat, 8awhat can I say?

#### 7:9a

**When the Canaanites and all who live in the land hear about this,**

* For the Canaanites and the other people of the country will hear about this
* The Canaanites and all the other people who live here will learn about it.

**When:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *When* introduces more of Joshua’s thoughts about Israel’s defeat. Some English versions translate this as “For” and others omit it. Use a natural option for your language in this context.

**the Canaanites and all who live in the land:** This phrase refers to all the people of the country. The *Canaanites* were one of the groups of people who lived in the land of Canaan.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> The Canaanites and all the other people in this country (NCV)

**Canaanites:** The name *Canaanites* refers to the people who live in Canaan.

Here is another way to translate this word:

> Canaan people

**hear about this:** The phrase *hear about this* indicates that the people who lived in the land will find out that Israel was defeated by Ai.

#### 7:9b

**they will surround us and wipe out our name from the earth.**

* and they will surround us and attack us and kill us all.
* They will come and kill us all, and no one will remember us anymore.

**they will surround us:** The clause *they will surround us* states the result of their defeat. After the people hear about Israel’s defeat at Ai, they will attack Israel. In some languages it may be clearer to make the result explicit. For example,

> The Canaanites and other people in the land will hear about this. Then they will surround us and attack us(excl)

**and wipe out our name from the earth:** The Hebrew expression that the BSB translates as *wipe out our name from the earth* is an idiom. It includes two ideas:

1. They will kill all the Israelites.
2. When the Israelites are dead, no one will speak their names or remember them anymore.

In some languages it may be clearer to express both these ideas. For example:

> Then they will kill us(excl) all, and no one will remember us anymore

#### 7:9c

**Then what will You do for Your great name?”**

* Then what will you do to protect the honor of your name?”
* This will bring shame on you because they will think you could not protect your people.”

**Then:** The Hebrew connector that the BSB translates as *Then* introduces another result of their defeat. Some English versions do not translate this connector. For example:

> What will you do to protect your great reputation? (NET)

**what will You do for Your great name?:** In modern English this reads: *what will You do for Your great name?* This is a rhetorical question. It functions as a strong statement that God’s reputation will be damaged.

Here are two ways to translate this strong statement:

* As a rhetorical question. For example:

    > And then what will happen to the honor of your great name? (NLT)

* As a statement. For example:

    > Then people will dishonor your great name. You will not be able to let them know how great you are.

Express this strong statement in a natural way in your language.

**great name:** The phrase *great name* refers to what people think about God. People thought that Yahweh was a great and powerful God. A god should be able to give his people success in battle.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> What will you do to protect your great reputation? (NET)

> You will not be able to make people believe that you are a great God

Yahweh explained to Joshua why the Israelites were defeated by the people of Ai.

#### 7:10a

**But the LORD said to Joshua,**

* ¶ But Yahweh answered Joshua:
* ¶ Then Yahweh replied to Joshua:

**But the LORD said to Joshua:** The name *LORD* is Yahweh, the personal name of God.

#### 7:10b

**“Stand up! Why have you fallen on your face?**

* “Get up. You should not be lying on the ground like that.
* “Stand up. It is time to get up from the ground.

**Stand up:** *Stand up* is a command from Yahweh to Joshua and means that Joshua must arise to a standing position.

**Why have you fallen on your face?:** This is a rhetorical question. It functions as a rebuke. Yahweh rebuked Joshua for lying on the ground.

Here are two ways to translate this rebuke:

* As a rhetorical question. For example:

    > Why are you lying on your face like this? (NLT)

* As a statement or a command. For example:

    > Stop lying there on the ground! (CEV)

Express this rebuke in a natural way in your language.

In Hebrew this clause has a word that means “like this,” or “in this way.” Include this phrase if it would be natural in your language.

**fallen on your face:** The word *fallen* refers to Joshua’s action in 7:6b. He lay on the ground with his face down as a gesture of sorrow and humility. You should translate this in the same way as you did in 7:6b.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 7:10

## Joshua 7:11 (id: 516084)

### Section 7:1–26 Achan sinned and God punished him

Achan disobeyed God. He took some of the things from Jericho that God told them to destroy. Because of his sin, the Israelites lost the battle against the town of Ai. Yahweh showed the Israelites that Achan was the one who had sinned, and they punished Achan.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The defeat at Ai

> Achan’s sin

### Paragraph 7:10–12

Yahweh explained to Joshua why the Israelites were defeated by the people of Ai.

#### 7:11

In 7:11 there is are six verbs that describe Israel’s sin. In Hebrew, there is a particle that precedes each verb. This particle is sometimes translated “also.” There are two ways to interpret this Hebrew particle.

1. Some English versions do not translate this particle. They translate the verbs in 7:11 as a simple list. For example:

    > Israel has sinned; they have violated my covenant, which I commanded them to keep. They have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen, they have lied, they have put them with their own possessions. (NIV) *(NIV, RSV, ESV, NCV, NET, NJPS, REB, GNT)*

2. Some English versions interpret this particle as marking emphasis. For example:

    > Israel has sinned; they have violated the covenant which I imposed on them. They have gone so far as to take what was under the curse of destruction, they have even stolen it; they have actually hidden it; they have put it in their baggage. (NJB) *(BSB, NJB, GW, NASB, NLT)*

It is not clear which interpretation is best. Option (1\) is a good option to follow along with the majority of English versions. However, if you wish to give an emphatic sense to the verbs as in option (2\) this is also acceptable.

#### 7:11a

**Israel has sinned;**

* The people of Israel have sinned.
* The Israelites have sinned.

**Israel has sinned:** A man named Achan took some of the things that were dedicated to Yahweh. Yahweh considered all the people of Israel to be guilty.

**sinned:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *sinned* has the sense of “missing the right way” and “incurring guilt.” It is a general term for sin.

#### 7:11b

**they have transgressed My covenant that I commanded them,**

* They have not kept the covenant that I made with them.
* They have not done what they promised to do.

**they have transgressed My covenant:** This means that the Israelites did not obey God’s commands.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> broken my covenant (NLT)

> they have broken the agreement with me that I ordered them to keep (GNT)

**My covenant:** Joshua told the Israelite people that everything in the town of Jericho must be destroyed. No Israelite must take anything from the town. Joshua’s commands followed the laws that God gave in Deuteronomy 20:10–20 about warfare. These laws were part of God’s covenant, or agreement, with the Israelites.

**that I commanded them:** God spoke through Joshua in verses 6:17–18 to remind the people of the laws about warfare which he gave them while Moses was still alive. Verse 7:11d explains which commands the people did not keep.

#### 7:11c

**and they have taken some of what was devoted to destruction.**

* They have taken some of the things that were set apart for me.
* They took some of the things from Jericho that I told them to destroy.

**and they have taken some of what was devoted to destruction:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *devoted to destruction* refers to the things which Yahweh commanded the Israelites to dedicate to him. You should translate it the same way you did in 7:1\.

#### 7:11d

**Indeed, they have stolen and lied,**

* They stole those things and then lied about it.
* They have stolen the things which belong to me and they tried to deceive me

**Indeed, they have stolen and lied:** Although only the man named Achan has stolen anything, God regards all the people of Israel as guilty.

**stolen:** When Achan took some of the things which God told the people of Israel to destroy, he stole them from God.

#### 7:11e

**and they have put these things with their own possessions.**

* They hid the things which belong to me among their own belongings.
* by hiding them among their own things.

**and they have put these things with their own possessions:** Achan hid the things he stole from God with his own personal belongings.

**possessions:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *possessions* is a general word, used for equipment, baggage, or belongings. You should choose a general, nonspecific word to translate *possessions*.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 7:11

## Joshua 7:12 (id: 516088)

### Section 7:1–26 Achan sinned and God punished him

Achan disobeyed God. He took some of the things from Jericho that God told them to destroy. Because of his sin, the Israelites lost the battle against the town of Ai. Yahweh showed the Israelites that Achan was the one who had sinned, and they punished Achan.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The defeat at Ai

> Achan’s sin

### Paragraph 7:10–12

Yahweh explained to Joshua why the Israelites were defeated by the people of Ai.

#### 7:12a

**This is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies.**

* This is why the Israelite army cannot conquer their enemies,
* The Israelite soldiers will not win a battle against their enemies because of their sin.

**This is why:** The Hebrew connector that the BSB translates as *This is why* introduces the result of what the Israelites have done. Because they stole things dedicated to God, they cannot defeat the town of Ai. You should translate the words *This is why* with a word or phrase in your language that makes this connection clear.

**the Israelites:** The phrase *the Israelites* refers to the Israelite soldiers.

**cannot stand against their enemies:** The phrase *cannot stand against their enemies* means that the Israelite army is not able to defeat their enemies. They were not able to defeat the people of Ai, and they will not be able to defeat the people of any other town.

#### 7:12b

**They will turn their backs and run from their enemies,**

* and why they run away from their enemies.
* Their enemies will defeat them in every battle,

**They will turn their backs and run from their enemies:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *They will turn their backs* is a Hebrew idiom. It means that the Israelite army turned back and ran away from the soldiers of Ai. If you have a similar idiom in your language, consider using it here.

#### 7:12c

**because they themselves have been set apart for destruction.**

* They have become a thing that is devoted to me, and they must die.
* because the Israelites themselves are now set apart for their enemies to destroy them.

**because they themselves have been set apart for destruction:** The people of Israel became one of the things which was set apart for Yahweh. The Israelites were told to destroy the things in Jericho. Because they did not do so, now Yahweh will destroy them. If possible, use the same expression for the “thing devoted to destruction” that you used previously (see 6:17 and 7:1\).

#### 7:12d

**I will no longer be with you**

* I will not stay with you any longer
* I will no longer protect you

**I will no longer be with you:** The clause *I will no longer be with you* expresses a further result of their violating God’s covenant. God will no longer help the Israelite army to defeat their enemies or protect them when they are attacked.

**you:** The pronoun *you* is plural. It refers to Joshua and all the Israelites.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> I will not help you anymore (NCV)

> I cannot help you anymore (CEV)

> I will not remain with you any longer (NLT)

#### 7:12e

**unless you remove from among you whatever is devoted to destruction.**

* unless you destroy the things set apart for me which some of you have.
* if you do not destroy the things that I commanded you to destroy.

**unless you remove from among you whatever is devoted to destruction:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *unless* introduces a condition. If the people of Israel do not destroy the devoted things, then God will withdraw his presence and help from them.

**remove from among you:** This phrase means that the Israelites must not continue to keep the things which belong to Yahweh in their camp.

**whatever is devoted to destruction:** This phrase refers to the things which Achan stole from Yahweh.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> The things which belong to me

> The things which I told you to destroy

> The things which are set apart for me

##### **General Comment on 7:12d\-e**

In some languages, it may be clearer to reverse the order of 7:12d and 7:12e. For example, you could say:

> 12eIf you do not destroy the devoted things from among you, 12dthen I will no longer be with you and help you.

### Section 7:1–26 Achan sinned and God punished him

Achan disobeyed God. He took some of the things from Jericho that God told them to destroy. Because of his sin, the Israelites lost the battle against the town of Ai. Yahweh showed the Israelites that Achan was the one who had sinned, and they punished Achan.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The defeat at Ai

> Achan’s sin

### Paragraph 7:13

God told Joshua what to say to the Israelites.

#### 7:13a

**Get up and consecrate the people,**

* ¶ Go and make the people holy.
* ¶ Tell the people to get ready to meet me.

**Get up:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *Get up* is literally “get up” or “stand up.” However, it can also be used to show the beginning of an action. It means “proceed” or “begin to.”

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> Proceed to sanctify the people (NRSV)

> Go, consecrate the people (NIV)

Translate this idea of “proceed to action” in a way that is natural in your language.

**consecrate the people:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates *consecrate* means that people are made holy for Yahweh by means of a ritual. They then belong to Yahweh. When the people of Israel do this, they will become pure again. In Exodus 19:10 the people were sanctified with the ritual of washing their clothes. In Exodus 19:15 they did not have sex. We do not know what ritual they followed in Joshua 7, so it is best to translate this word in a general way.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> Purify the people

> Make the people holy

> Prepare the people to meet me

#### 7:13b

**saying, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow,**

* Tell them to purify themselves for tomorrow.
* Tell them they must purify themselves in order to meet me tomorrow.

**Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow:** God told Joshua to have the people purify themselves so that they will be ready to meet with God the next day. Some English versions combine 13a and 13b because they repeat the same information.

> Command the people to purify themselves in preparation for tomorrow (NLT)

> Tell the people, ‘Get ready for tomorrow by performing the ceremonies to make yourselves holy.’ (GW)

#### 7:13c

**for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:**

* Yahweh, the God of Israel, is saying to the Israelites:
* Tell them that I, Yahweh, the God of Israel

**for:** The connector that the BSB translates as *for* indicates the reason for God’s judgment on Israel. Use a connector that is natural in your language.

**this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:** This clause, *what the LORD, the God of Israel, says*, is an emphatic formula. It means that God will make an important declaration. God will make this declaration through the speech of Joshua. Use a natural way to show that the following speech is important and should be considered seriously.

These are embedded quotations. There is a quotation within a quotation within a quotation. God told Joshua to say to the people what God said. One way to translate 7:13a\-c is:

> God said, Get up Joshua, and sanctify the people. This is what you are to say to them, “Sanctify yourselves, because Yahweh, the God of Israel himself says this…

Translate these embedded quotes in a way that is natural in your language.

#### 7:13d

**Among you, O Israel, there are things devoted to destruction.**

* ‘People of Israel, you have things in your camp that belong to me.
* know that they have hidden things in the camp that they should have set apart for me.

**Among you:** This phrase means that the devoted things were somewhere in the Israelite camp.

**O Israel:** The phrase *O Israel* shows that God is speaking to the people of Israel. It may not be possible in your language to put the addressee at the end of the sentence. You can put the addressee somewhere else in the sentence.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> Israel, you have in your possession some things that I ordered you to destroy! (GNT)

> Hidden among you, O Israel, are things set apart for the Lord. (NLT)

**there are things devoted to destruction:** The *things devoted to destruction* refer to the things that belong to God and that the Israelites must destroy. You should translate *things devoted to destruction* the same way you did in 7:1\.

#### 7:13e

**You cannot stand against your enemies**

* You will have to run away from your enemies,
* They will continue to flee from their enemies

**You cannot stand against your enemies:** The clause *You cannot stand against your enemies* means that the Israelites will not be able to defeat their enemies.

#### 7:13f

**until you remove them.**

* until you destroy the things which I commanded you to destroy.’
* until they get rid of those things from their camp.

**until you remove them:** The Israelites must destroy the things that are dedicated for God’s use. God will not help them defeat their enemies until they obey him.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 7:13

### Section 7:1–26 Achan sinned and God punished him

### Paragraph 7:14–15

God gave Joshua further instructions about what should happen the next day.

#### 7:14

**tribe by tribe…clan by clan…family by family:** There are three Hebrew words in this verse that you should think about.

The Hebrew word שֵׁבֶט *shebet* that the BSB translates as *tribe* refers to the descendants of Jacob. Jacob had twelve sons. The twelve sons became the ancestors of twelve groups of people. All twelve groups in Israel spoke Hebrew. They did not speak twelve different languages. For this reason the word *shebet* is translated in the display as “clan.” Choose a word in your language that refers to a group of people descended from a common ancestor.

The Hebrew word מִשְׁפָּחָה *mishpahah* that the BSB translates as *clan* refers to a part of a clan. Each clan had several sub\-clans. Each of Jacob’s sons had their own sons, and the sub\-clans were named after these grandsons of Jacob. The word *mishpahah* is translated in the display as “sub\-clan.”

The Hebrew word בַּיִת *bet* that the BSB translates as *family* refers to a family or an extended family. The families do not have names. The word *bet* is translated in the display as “family.”

Here are some ways that these three terms are translated in English versions:

> tribe…family…household (RSV, GW, NASB, KJV)

> tribe…clan…family (BSB, NET, NIV, NABRE, NLT, GNT, CEV)

> tribe…clan…household (ESV)

> tribe…clan…ancestral house (NJPS)

> clan…sub\-clan…family (in the TN Display)

#### 7:14a

**In the morning you must present yourselves tribe by tribe.**

* ¶ Tomorrow morning, you must come near to the Tent of Meeting one clan at a time.
* ¶ Tomorrow morning, the Israelite people must come before Yahweh clan by clan.

This verse begins with a Hebrew word that is often translated as “and.” This word makes a connection between the sin that the Israelites did and what Yahweh does next. There may be an appropriate word in some languages to show this connection, or no connecting word may be necessary. The BSB and many English versions leave the connection as implied information.

**In the morning:** The phrase *In the morning* can also be translated:

> tomorrow morning

**you must present yourselves:** The people went near to Yahweh so that Yahweh could choose the guilty person. They stood in front of the Tent of Meeting, the place where Yahweh meets with his people. The Tent of Meeting is not mentioned in the Hebrew text or the BSB, but it may be clearer to make it explicit in some languages.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> you must approach (NET)

> you will come forward (CEV)

> you must come near to Yahweh at the Tent of Meeting

**tribe by tribe:** The phrase *tribe by tribe* means that the Israelite people must come in twelve groups before Yahweh, with one tribe in each group.

**tribe:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *tribe* refers to the people who descended from one of the twelve sons of Jacob. Each of Jacob’s sons had children and grandchildren, and those descendants were part of his tribe. Choose a word that is appropriate for a group of people descended from a common ancestor.

#### 7:14b

**The tribe that the LORD selects shall come forward clan by clan,**

* The clan that Yahweh chooses must come near one sub\-clan at a time.
* The clan that Yahweh chooses by lot shall come sub\-clan by sub\-clan.

**The tribe that the LORD selects:** It is not certain how Yahweh told them which tribe he chose. Probably they cast lots, throwing small pebbles to determine the choice.7:14 See TWOT, p. 171\.

**shall come forward clan by clan:** When Yahweh chose one of the tribes, then each family in that tribe came before Yahweh.

**clan:** There were twelve tribes in the nation of Israel, named after the twelve sons of Jacob. Each tribe had several “clans.” A *clan* includes many families.

Here are some other ways to translate the word *clan*:

> clan (BSB, NET, ESV, NIV, GNT, NLT)

> sub\-clan (used in the TN Display)

> family group

> branch (of a tribe)

#### 7:14c

**and the clan that the LORD selects shall come forward family by family,**

* The sub\-clan which Yahweh chooses must come near one family at a time.
* The sub\-clan which Yahweh chooses by lot shall come family by family.

**and the clan that the LORD selects shall come forward family by family:** When Yahweh chose a *clan*, the people within that clan must come forward, one family at a time.

**family:** This refers to a group of relatives who live in the same house. Sometimes a *family* consisted of extended families who lived in several houses.

#### 7:14d

**and the family that the LORD selects shall come forward man by man.**

* The family which Yahweh chooses must come near one man at a time.
* The family which Yahweh chooses by lot shall come man by man.

**and the family that the LORD selects shall come forward man by man:** After Yahweh chose one household, then the men of that household came forward one person at a time.

**man by man:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *man* refers to a male adult. Some English versions (NRSV, GNT, CEV, NLT) use a general word such as “person by person.” Translate this so that it is clear that the male adults came forward.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 7:14

## Joshua 7:15 (id: 516092)

### Section 7:1–26 Achan sinned and God punished him

Achan disobeyed God. He took some of the things from Jericho that God told them to destroy. Because of his sin, the Israelites lost the battle against the town of Ai. Yahweh showed the Israelites that Achan was the one who had sinned, and they punished Achan.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The defeat at Ai

> Achan’s sin

### Paragraph 7:14–15

God gave Joshua further instructions about what should happen the next day.

#### 7:15a

**The one who is caught with the things devoted to destruction**

* The guilty person whom Yahweh selects because he has stolen Yahweh’s things
* When the lot shows the guilty person who took what belongs to Yahweh

**The one who is caught:** Yahweh will choose one of the men. The people will know he is guilty because Yahweh will cause the lot to show this.

**with the things devoted to destruction:** The *things devoted to destruction* were things from Jericho that must be destroyed. The guilty person did not have the devoted things with him as he stood at the Tent of Meeting. Yahweh knew that this person had stolen them and hidden them. In some languages it might be helpful to make this explicit. For example, you could say:

> he who has stolen the devoted things

#### 7:15b

**must be burned,**

* must die and then be burned up.
* you must kill him and then destroy his corpse with fire.

**must be burned:** The fire must destroy him because he had become like one of the things in Jericho that belonged to Yahweh. In some languages it may be redundant to translate “burned with fire” because this is already implied by the word burned.

In 7:25 we learn that they killed the guilty person and then burned his body.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> you shall kill that person and then burn his body in the fire

#### 7:15c

**along with all that belongs to him,**

* All his family and everything he owns must burn up with him
* The fire must destroy him and his family and all his possessions,

**along with all that belongs to him:** The Hebrew is more literally “he and all that he has.” The word “he” is repeated in Hebrew for emphasis.

**all that belongs to him:** The phrase *all that belongs to him* refers to his family as well as his belongings. It may be necessary to make this explicit in some languages. For example:

> along with his family and everything he owns (GNT)

#### 7:15d

**because he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD**

* because he has broken the agreement with Yahweh.
* because he has not kept the promise which the people of Israel made to Yahweh.

**because:** The connector that the BSB translates as *because* introduces the reason for the punishment of the guilty person.

**he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD:** The phrase *he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD* means that the person did not keep the promise which the Israelite people agreed to keep.

**covenant:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *covenant* refers to an agreement of loyalty made between two people. In the Old Testament it often refers to an agreement between God and his people.

#### 7:15e

**and committed an outrage in Israel.’”**

* He has disgraced the people of Israel.”
* He has brought shame on the Israelites.”

**and:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *and* introduces a second reason for the punishment of the guilty person.

**committed an outrage in Israel:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *an outrage* refers to something evil, such as a willful sin. Achan disgraced the Israelites by doing this deed.

**Israel:** The word *Israel* refers to the Israelite people. Achan did this sin among the people of Israel. For example:

> has done a disgraceful thing among the people of Israel! (NCV)

Yahweh chose Achan as the man who was guilty of the sin.

#### 7:16a

**So Joshua arose early the next morning**

* ¶ The next morning Joshua woke up early,
* ¶ Early the next morning Joshua got up

**So:** The Hebrew connector that the BSB translates as *So* introduces the result of God’s instructions to Joshua and Israel. Use a natural way in your language to indicate a result.

**Joshua arose early the next morning:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *arose early* can also be translated as:

> woke up early

> got up early

#### 7:16b

**and had Israel come forward tribe by tribe,**

* and made each clan of Israel come near the Tent of Meeting one by one,
* and led the Israelites before Yahweh clan by clan.

**and had Israel come forward tribe by tribe:** Joshua told the people of Israel to come and stand in front of the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. Then each tribe came forward one tribe at a time.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> Joshua had Israel come forward by tribes (NIV)

> he made Israel come forward tribe by tribe (NJB)

#### 7:16c

**and the tribe of Judah was selected.**

* and Yahweh chose the clan of Judah.
* Yahweh showed that the clan of Judah was guilty.

**and the tribe of Judah was selected:** The phrase *was selected* means that God chose the tribe of Judah. The method of choosing is unknown, but many scholars believe that they cast lots. To cast lots they threw small stones. The way the stones fell on the ground indicated the choice. The Israelites believed that God governed the way the stones fell.

The verb phrase *was selected* is passive. If you need to use an active verb in your language these are some ways you could translate this phrase:

> the Lord chose the tribe of Judah (NCV)

> the lot indicated the tribe was Judah (NJB)

* When Joshua brought the sub\-clans of the clan of Judah forward,

**He had the clans of Judah come forward:** The clause *He had the clans of Judah come forward* indicates that Joshua made each family stand in front of the Tent of Meeting one by one.

**clans of Judah:** Each “clan” in the tribe of Judah traced their ancestry back to one of the sons of Judah.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Then Joshua brought the clans of Judah to the Lord (CEV)

> He then had the clans of Judah come forward (NJPS)

#### 7:17b

**and the clan of the Zerahites was selected.**

* and Yahweh chose the sub\-clan of Zerah.
* Yahweh showed that the Zerah sub\-clan was guilty.

**and the clan of the Zerahites was selected:** Zerah was one of the sons of Judah. The *clan* of Zerah included all the descendants of Zerah.

**Zerahites:** In Numbers 26:20 the man Zerah is shown as the head of one of the clans of the tribe of Judah.

Here are some other ways to translate *Zerahites*:

> the Zerah clan (CEV)

> the descendants of Zerah

> the Zerah branch of the Judah tribe

**was selected:** The phrase that the BSB translates as *was selected* indicates that Yahweh chose the clan of Zerah. In some languages it may be necessary to translate this with an active verb. For example:

* Then Joshua made the families in the sub\-clan of Zerah come near the Tent of Meeting one by one,
* When Joshua brought the families of Zerah forward family by family

**(NIV) he had the clan of the Zerahites come forward by families:** The pronoun *he* refers to Joshua.

**(NIV) had the clan of the Zerahites come forward:** Joshua made the households in the clan of Zerah come and stand in front of the Tent of Meeting.

**(NIV) by families:** There is a textual issue in this verse that the BSB leaves untranslated.

1. Some Hebrew manuscripts, and the Syriac translation and Latin Vulgate translation say family by family. For example:

    > And he had the clan of the Zerahites come forward by families (NIV) *(NIV, NRSV, NCV, NJPS, NLT, NJB, REB, GNT)*

2. The Hebrew Masoretic text says man by man. For example:

    > And he brought near the clan of the Zerahites man by man (ESV) *(ESV, RSV, GW, NASB, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\). “Family by family” fits the context better because it agrees with verse 7:14c.

#### 7:17d

**and the family of Zabdi was selected.**

* and Yahweh chose Zabdi’s family.
* Yahweh showed that someone in the family of Zabdi was guilty.

**and the family of Zabdi:** *Zabdi* was the grandfather of Achan. He was mentioned in 7:1\. Achan was a part of Zabdi’s family.

**was selected:** Yahweh chose Zabdi. This showed that someone in Zabdi’s family was guilty. The verb *was selected* is passive. It may be necessary in some languages to use an active verb. For example:

**and Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was selected.**

* Yahweh chose Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the clan of Judah.
* Yahweh showed that Achan was guilty. Achan was the son of Carmi, the grandson of Zabdi, the great\-grandson of Zerah, of the clan of Judah.

**and Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah:** The author repeats the lineage of Achan as he did in 7:1\. These are the names of his father, grandfather and great grandfather. You should translate this list in a way that is natural in your language. Some English versions leave this list of names implicit.

**of the tribe of Judah:** Achan’s family traced their ancestry back to Judah, one of the sons of Jacob.

**was selected:** Yahweh selected Achan by means of the lot. In some languages, the passive verb *was selected* may need to be translated as an active verb. For example:

> The Lord chose Achan son of Carmi (NCV)

### Section 7:1–26 Achan sinned and God punished him

Achan disobeyed God. He took some of the things from Jericho that God told them to destroy. Because of his sin, the Israelites lost the battle against the town of Ai. Yahweh showed the Israelites that Achan was the one who had sinned, and they punished Achan.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The defeat at Ai

> Achan’s sin

### Paragraph 7:19

Joshua asked Achan to confess.

#### 7:19a

**So Joshua said to Achan,**

* ¶ Then Joshua told Achan:
* ¶ So Joshua said to him:

**So Joshua said to Achan:** After the lot showed that Achan was guilty, Joshua gave advice, or a warning, to Achan.

#### 7:19b

**“My son, give glory to the LORD, the God of Israel,**

* “My son, honor Yahweh, the God of Israel.
* “Achan, bring glory to Yahweh, the God of Israel

**My son:** The direct address *My son* indicates that Joshua had higher status than Achan, and that he addressed him in a polite manner. It does not mean that Achan was really Joshua’s son. Use a form of address that is appropriate in this context. It may be more natural to not translate this phrase.

**give glory to the LORD, the God of Israel:** Joshua urged Achan to tell the truth. If Achan tells the truth, he will honor God and give glory to him.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> Honor Yahweh, who is the God of Israel, by telling the truth

> tell the truth here before the Lord, the God of Israel (GNT)

#### 7:19c

**and make a confession to Him.**

* Confess your sin to him.
* and confess to him what you have done.

**and make a confession to Him:** There are two ways to interpret the Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *make a confession*:

1. It means confess. For example:

    > and confess (GNT) *(BSB, GNT, NRSV, NJPS, NLT, REB, NCV, KJV)*

2. It means give praise. For example:

    > and give him the praise (NIV) *(NIV, RSV, NET, ESV, NABRE, NASB)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). This fits well with the context.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> confess your sin to Yahweh

#### 7:19d

**I urge you to tell me what you have done;**

* Tell me what you did.
* Tell me right now the wrong thing you have done.

#### 7:19e

Achan confessed his sin.

#### 7:20a

**“It is true,” Achan replied,**

* ¶ So Achan told Joshua: “Truly
* ¶ Then Achan answered: “It is true

The Hebrew conjugation that the BSB leaves untranslated but the some English versions translate as “and” introduces the next event in the storyline. Introduce this next event in a way that is most natural in your language.

**It is true:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *It is true* can also be translated:

> truly (ESV)

**Achan replied:** Achan replied to Joshua’s warning.

#### 7:20b

**“I have sinned against the LORD, the God of Israel.**

* I have sinned against Yahweh, the God of Israel.
* that I have sinned against Yahweh, who is Israel’s God.

**I have sinned against the LORD, the God of Israel:** Achan acknowledged that he had sinned. This sin was against Yahweh, the God of Israel.

#### 7:20c

**This is what I did:**

* This is how I sinned:
* I will describe my sin to you.

**This is what I did:** The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as *This is what I did* is literally “and like this, and like this.” This is a Hebrew idiom. It indicates that what follows is his confession. Some English versions do not translate this clause. Translate it in a way that is natural in your language.

#### 7:21a

**When I saw among the spoils a beautiful cloak from Shinar,**

* I saw a beautiful robe from Babylon among the things from Jericho,
* I saw a beautiful Babylonian coat among the things the soldiers seized.

**When I saw among the spoils:** The phrase *the spoils* refers to the things that were taken by the Israelite soldiers when they conquered Jericho.

Here are some other ways to translate the word *spoils*:

> Among the plunder I saw (NLT)

> among the booty I saw (REB)

> Among the things we seized I saw (GNT)

**a beautiful cloak:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as a *cloak* refers to the outer garment that an important person wears.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> a beautiful robe

> a beautiful cloak

**from Shinar:** *Shinar* is another name for the country of Babylon. You may want to use the more common name, Babylon, in your translation. For example:

> a beautiful robe from Babylon (NLT)

In English the adjective form of Babylon is “Babylonian.” Thus, the GNT says:

> a beautiful Babylonian cloak (GNT)

#### 7:21b

**two hundred shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels,**

* and more than five pounds of silver, and more than a pound of gold.
* I also saw about two kilograms of silver and a gold bar weighing about half a kilogram.

**two hundred shekels of silver:** A “shekel” is a measure of weight. It is not a coin. In the time of Joshua there was not yet any coined money. *two hundred shekels of silver* was about five pounds of silver, or more than two kilograms. The exact weight of a shekel was varied, so these weights are approximations. You can translate this using the standard measure of weight used in your country.

**and a bar of gold:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *bar* is literally “tongue.” The gold was probably in a lump similar in shape to the tongue. Use an expression for a large piece of gold that is natural in your language.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> a gold bar (CEV)

> a wedge of gold (NIV)

**weighing fifty shekels:** The weight, *fifty shekels*, was a little over one pound or about one\-half kilogram. Translate this weight using the standard measure for precious metals in your country.

#### 7:21c

**I coveted them and took them.**

* I wanted them very much, so I took them.
* When I saw them, I wanted them so much that I stole them.

**I coveted them:** The phrase *I coveted them* means that Achan wanted to have these things very much. The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *coveted* is the same word used in the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20:17\.

Here are some other ways to translate the word *coveted*:

> I wanted these things very much for myself (NCV)

> I wanted them so much (GNT)

> I wanted them (NET)

**and:** The Hebrew prefix that the BSB translates as *and* indicates the next event in the storyline.

**took them:** The things that Achan took belonged to Yahweh. It may be more appropriate in some languages to translate the word *took* as “stole.” This is how Yahweh describes Achan’s action in 7:11d.

#### 7:21d

**They are hidden in the ground inside my tent,**

* I hid them in the ground underneath my tent,
* I dug a hole in the ground underneath my tent and hid them in it.

The Hebrew word that the BSB leaves untranslated but some English versions translate as “behold” emphasizes the following word or clause. In this case, it adds emphasis to “They are hidden.” You may have a word or grammatical particle in your language that performs the same function. Many English versions leave this word untranslated.

**They are hidden in the ground inside my tent:** Achan took the things and buried them in a hole in the ground under his tent. In some languages an active verb may be necessary. For example:

> I dug a hole under my tent and hid the silver, the gold, and the robe. (CEV)

> I hid them in the earth inside my tent

#### 7:21e

**with the silver underneath.”**

* and put the silver at the bottom of the hole with the other things on top of it.”
* The silver is underneath the gold and the robe.”

**with the silver underneath:** Achan buried the silver at the bottom of the hole, with the gold and the robe on top of it.

#### 7:22a

**So Joshua sent messengers**

* ¶ After Achan confessed Joshua sent men to search Achan’s tent.
* ¶ Then Joshua ordered some men to go and look for the things.

**So:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *So* introduces the result after Achan confessed his sin. It may be clearer to make the connection explicit. For example, you could say:

> So, after Achan had confessed his sin, Joshua sent messengers

**Joshua sent messengers:** The word *messengers* refers to people whom Joshua told to go and search Achan’s tent.

#### 7:22b

**who ran to the tent,**

* These men ran to the tent,
* The men hurried to the tent.

The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB leaves untranslated but some English versions translate as “and” indicates the next event in the storyline. Some other English versions do not translate this word. Translate it in a way that is natural in your language.

**ran to the tent:** The phrase *ran to the tent* indicates that it was urgent to resolve this serious problem.

#### 7:22c

**and there it all was, hidden in his tent, with the silver underneath.**

* and found the robe and the bar of gold with the silver underneath them.
* The robe and the bar of gold were buried in the ground on top of the silver as Achan said.

**there:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *there* emphasizes what happens next in the story. Some English versions do not translate this word, buy many English versions translate it as “behold.” You may have a particle or another way in your language that has the same function. Translate it in a way that is natural in your language.

**was, hidden in his tent:** The men Joshua sent found the things buried under his tent, as he said they were. The verb phrase *was, hidden in his tent* is passive. In some languages it may be necessary to translate with an active verb. For example, you could say:

> Achan had hidden it in his tent

**with the silver underneath:** The *silver* was buried at the bottom of the hole. The robe and the bar of gold were on top of the silver.

* Then the men took the things out of the ground under his tent

The Hebrew word that the BSB leaves untranslated but some English versions translate as “and” indicates the next event in the storyline. Translate it in a way that is natural in your language.

**They:** The word *They* here refers to the men whom Joshua sent to search for the stolen things.

**the things:** The phrase *the things* refers to the three stolen things.

#### 7:23b

**brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites,**

* and brought them to Joshua. All the Israelites were standing and watching near him.
* and presented them to Joshua. All Israelite people were still gathered with him.

The Hebrew word that the BSB leaves untranslated but some English versions translate as “and” indicates the next event in the storyline. Translate it in a way that is natural in your language.

**brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites:** The pronoun *them* here refers to the stolen things which the messengers found buried in the tent. The men who searched Achan’s tent brought the stolen things to Joshua and the people.

#### 7:23c

**and spread them out before the LORD.**

* The men spread the things out in front of the Tent of Meeting.
* The men spread out the things on the ground in the presence of Yahweh.

**and:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *and* indicates the next event in the storyline.

### Paragraph 7:22–26

Joshua and the Israelites stoned and burned Achan and his family.

#### 7:24a

**Then Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan son of Zerah,**

* Then Joshua, together with all the Israelites, led away Achan, whose father was Zerah.
* Then Joshua and the Israelite people took Achan, Zerah’s son,

**Then:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Then* indicates the next event in the storyline.

**Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan son of Zerah:** The Israelite people, with Joshua as their leader, took Achan away to the place where he will be punished.

**Achan son of Zerah:** The phrase *son of Zerah* recalls the genealogy of Achan in 7:1\. It emphasizes that the correct person will be punished. Some English versions leave out this phrase. Consider whether this phrase is natural in your language or not.

#### 7:24b

**the silver, the cloak, the bar of gold,**

* They brought along the silver and the robe and the bar of gold.
* with the things Achan stole from Yahweh.

**the silver, the cloak, the bar of gold:** These things were mentioned in 7:21\. You should translate them the same way as you did there. If the repetition of the list is unnatural in your language, you can translate it as CEV has done:

> the things he had stolen (CEV)

#### 7:24c

**his sons and daughters, his oxen and donkeys and sheep,**

* They also took his sons and daughters, and his oxen and donkeys and sheep.
* They took him with his sons and daughters, and his oxen, donkeys, sheep, and goats,

**his sons and daughters:** The author specifies *sons and daughters* to indicate that Achan will have no descendants. It may be more natural in some languages to begin a new sentence here.

**his oxen and donkeys and sheep:** *oxen*, *donkeys* and *sheep* were domestic animals. Listing the animals separately in Hebrew emphasizes that Achan did a serious thing. It may be more natural in some languages to use an inclusive term such as:

> all his domestic animals

**sheep:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *sheep* refers to both goats and sheep. These are animals that they herded in flocks.

#### 7:24d

**his tent, and everything else he owned,**

* They took his tent and everything else that belonged to Achan,
* and his tent, and all his other possessions.

**his tent, and everything else he owned:** Everything else that Achan possessed was also brought with him to the Valley of Achor.

#### 7:24e

**and brought them to the Valley of Achor.**

* and brought them to the Valley of Trouble.
* They brought them to Trouble Valley.

**and:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *and* introduces the next event in the storyline.

**brought them:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *brought* indicates that the Valley of Achor was on higher ground than the place where the Israelites camped. The Israelites went uphill to reach it. In some languages it is natural to use the phrase “brought up” to indicate this. Many English versions translate this phrase as:

> took them

**them:** The word *them* here refers to all Achan’s family as possessions that were mentioned earlier in the verse. In some languages it may be clearer to make this explicit.

**to the Valley of Achor:** We are not sure where *the Valley of Achor* was. Many scholars believe that it was a wilderness area eight miles north of Jericho. This means that Joshua took Achan far away from the Israelite camp.7:24 See, for example, Hess, p. 155\.

**Valley of Achor:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Achor* means “trouble.” There are two ways to translate the phrase *Valley of Achor*.

1. Translate it as “Valley of Trouble” or “Trouble Valley.” For example:

    > Valley of Disaster (NET) *(NET, CEV, NCV, GNT)*

2. Translate it as “Valley of Achor.” For example:

    > Valley of Achor (NIV) *(BSB, NIV, RSV, ESV, NASB, NJB, NJPS, NLT, REB)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\) and translate with a word meaning “trouble” or “disaster.” This will help readers to understand Joshua’s rhetorical question in 7:25\.7:24 The term “Valley of Achor” also occurs in Isaiah 65:10 and Hosea 2:15\.

If you choose option (2\) it is recommended that you include a footnote explaining the meaning of Achor. For example:

> FOOTNOTE: The name Achor means “trouble”

##### **General Comment on 7:24**

It is possible to break up this long Hebrew sentence into two or more shorter sentences. Some English versions also reorder the parts of this verse. For example:

> 24aThen Joshua and all the people led Achan son of Zerah 24eto the Valley of Trouble. 24bThey also took the silver, the coat, the gold, 24cAchan’s sons, daughters, cattle, donkeys, sheep, 24dtent, and everything he owned. (NCV)

> The defeat at Ai

> Achan’s sin

### Paragraph 7:22–26

Joshua and the Israelites stoned and burned Achan and his family.

#### 7:25a

**“Why have you brought this trouble upon us?”**

* “Why have you brought so much trouble on us?”
* “You have brought a lot of trouble for us,”

**Why have you brought this trouble upon us?:** This is a rhetorical question. It functions as a rebuke. Joshua rebuked Achan because he stole the devoted things and caused the Israelites to lose the battle of Ai.

Here are two ways to translate this rebuke:

* As a rhetorical question. For example:

    > Why did you bring this disaster on us? (GW)

* As a statement or exclamation. For example:

    > You have brought a lot of trouble on us(excl)

    > I don’t know why you caused so much trouble for us! (NCV)

Express this rebuke in a natural way in your language.

**brought this trouble:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *brought…trouble* is the same word that Joshua used in 6:18\. You should use the same word to translate it here as you did in that verse.

The Hebrew word for *brought…trouble* sounds like “Achor” the name of the valley.

#### 7:25b

**said Joshua.**

* Joshua asked.
* Joshua said.

**said Joshua:** The Hebrew has this phrase at the beginning of 7:25a and begins with a word that many English versions translate as “and.” This word introduces the next event in the storyline. Indicate the next event in a way that is natural in your language.

In some languages it may be clearer to make the connection to the previous event explicit. For example:

> When they arrived there, Joshua said

Joshua addressed Achan with a rhetorical question in 7:25a. If you translate it as a question, you need to think about how to introduce a question in your language. In some languages it may be more natural to say:

> Joshua asked

#### 7:25c

**“Today the LORD will bring trouble upon you!”**

* “Now Yahweh will bring the same trouble on you.”
* “Today Yahweh will bring trouble for you.”

**Today the LORD will bring trouble upon you:** Because Achan took the things that belonged to Yahweh, Yahweh punished Achan.

#### 7:25d

**And all Israel stoned him to death.**

* Then all the people of Israel threw stones at him so that he died.
* Then all the Israelites threw stones at him until he died.

**And:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *And* indicates the next event in the storyline.

**all Israel:** The phrase *all Israel* means all the people of Israel.

**stoned him to death:** The phrase *stoned him to death* means that they threw stones at him until he died.7:25 Hess suggests that Achan’s sons and daughters had to die with him so that Achan’s name will be forgotten. His sin was so grave that God did not allow him to have any descendants (Hess, p. 154\). Butler suggests that “anyone who had come into contact with the goods was contaminated and had to be removed from the community to protect the community” (Butler, p. 86\). Achan’s family came into contact with the stolen goods because he hid them inside his family tent.

#### 7:25e

**Then they stoned the others and burned their bodies.**

* They also threw stones at his family so that they died. Then they burned the bodies and their things.
* They also killed his family by throwing stones at them. And they burned the bodies and the things that belonged to them.

**Then they stoned the others:** The stoning of Achan is mentioned first because he was the person who sinned. However, Achan’s family must die also.

The Hebrew clauses are not in chronological order. In some languages it may be clearer to rearrange them. First people stoned Achan, then they stoned his family, then they burned their bodies and their possessions.

**and burned their bodies:** There is disagreement among scholars as to whether *their bodies* refers to Achan’s possessions, or to the bodies of Achan and his family. Most English versions understand *their bodies* to refer to both the bodies and the possessions.

##### **General Comment on 7:25d\-e**

These clauses can be reordered chronologically. It is also possible to include the implied information that Achan’s possessions were with him.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> All the people then stoned Achan to death; they also stoned and burned his family and possessions (GNT)

> And all the Israelites stoned Achan and his family and burned their bodies (NLT)

**And they heaped over Achan a large pile of rocks**

* Then they covered Achan’s body with a big pile of rocks.
* Then the Israelites piled up rocks to completely cover Achan’s body.

**And:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *And* introduces the next event in the storyline.

**they heaped over Achan a large pile of rocks:** This phrase indicates that the people of Israel took stones and piled them over him until his body was hidden.

#### 7:26b

**that remains to this day.**

* That pile of rocks is still here today.
* The heap of rocks has stood here until this time.

**that remains to this day:** This phrase indicates that the pile of stones was still there when the author wrote the book of Joshua.

#### 7:26c

**So the LORD turned from His burning anger.**

* After that, Yahweh stopped being angry with the Israelites.
* Then Yahweh was no longer angry.

**So:** The Hebrew prefix that the BSB translates as *So* introduces the next event in the storyline. Introduce the next event in a way that is natural in your language.

**the LORD turned from His burning anger:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *turned from* is more literally “turned back.” It indicates that Yahweh stopped being angry.

**His burning anger:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *His burning anger* is more literally “the burning of his anger.” This is an idiom. It means that Yahweh was angry at the Israelites. However, they obeyed him by destroying the devoted things, and so Yahweh was no longer angry.

#### 7:26d

**Therefore that place is called the Valley of Achor to this day.**

* That is why the place where Achan was stoned is called the Valley of Trouble.
* Because of this, the name of that place is still called Trouble Valley.

**Therefore:** The Hebrew connector that the BSB translates as *Therefore* introduces the reason why the place is called Achor.

**that place is called the Valley of Achor:** The word *Achor* in Hebrew means “trouble.” You should translate it as you did in 7:24e. It is recommended that you translate it as “Trouble Valley.”

**to this day:** This phrase *this day* refers to the time that the book of Joshua was written.

### Section 8:1–29 Israel defeated Ai.

In chapter 7, Israel attacked Ai and the soldiers of Ai defeated them. They were discouraged but they repented of their sin. In chapter 8, God told Joshua to attack Ai again. This time, the Israelites were victorious and defeated Ai.

Verses 8:1–9 describe Joshua’s preparations to attack Ai, with details about the ambush. The soldiers in the ambush left by night ahead of the other soldiers. Verses 8:10–27 describe the movement of the soldiers, and the defeat of Ai. Verses 8:28–29 is a summary of the story.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The fall and destruction of Ai

> Israel conquered Ai

#### 8:1a

**Then the LORD said to Joshua,**

* ¶ Then Yahweh said to Joshua:
* ¶ Yahweh told Joshua:

**Then the LORD said to Joshua:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Then* introduces the next event in the storyline. Some English versions use a different word to mark the next event. Some do not use any word. For example:

> And the Lord said to Joshua (RSV)

> The Lord said to Joshua (GNT)

Use a natural way in your language to introduce the next event in the storyline.

#### 8:1b

**“Do not be afraid or discouraged.**

* “Don’t(sing) be afraid and don’t give up.
* “Do not be afraid at all.

**Do not be afraid or discouraged:** The two Hebrew words that the BSB translates as *afraid* and *discouraged* are imperative commands. The repetition of two synonyms makes this command emphatic. Joshua should not be afraid at all.

Translate this as an emphatic command. It is not necessary to use two verbs unless it is natural to do so. An adverb or an emphatic particle may be a more natural way to express this idea. Some languages have an idiom with this meaning.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged (NIV)

> Don’t be afraid or give up (NCV)

It may be helpful to add implicit information to make clear why Joshua might be afraid, as in the CEV:

> Don’t be afraid, and don’t be discouraged by what happened at the town of Ai (CEV)

#### 8:1c

#### 8:1d

**and go up and attack Ai.**

* and go up to Ai.
* and attack Ai.

**and go up and attack Ai:** The Hebrew that the BSB translates as *go up and attack* is more literally “arise, go up.” The command “arise” is used to introduce a command. The command is “go up.” Translate this command in a way that is natural in your language. For example:

> go on up to Ai (GNT)

**attack:** As mentioned in the previous note, the Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *attack* is more literally “go up.” The town of Ai was at a higher elevation than Gilgal, where the Israelites camped. The Israelites went uphill to go from Gilgal to Ai. If your language does not keep track of elevation in this way, you can translate it as:

> fight against Ai

> Lead all your fighting men to Ai (NCV)

**Ai:** The town of Ai was mentioned in 7:2\. You should translate it in the same way in both places.

#### 8:1e

**See, I have delivered into your hand the king of Ai,**

* I will help you(sing) to defeat the king of Ai.
* I will give the king of Ai,

**See, I have delivered into your hand the king of Ai:** It is recommended that you begin a new sentence here.

**See:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *See* is an emphatic word. It shows the importance of what Yahweh told Joshua. There may be another word or a grammatical particle in some languages to add emphasis. Some versions do not mark emphasis here. Use a word or a grammatical marker that is natural in your language.

**I have delivered into your hand:** The phrase *I have delivered into your hand* is a Hebrew idiom. It means that Yahweh will help Joshua and the Israelites to defeat the king of Ai.

**your:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *your* is singular. God is speaking to Joshua. It may be more natural in some languages to translate this as a plural. For example:

> I will give the king of Ai into your hands

> I will help you(plur) to defeat the king of Ai

#### 8:1f

**his people, his city, and his land.**

* You will defeat the people in Ai and conquer his land.
* and his people, and his city, and his land to you.

**his people, his city, and his land:** The word *his* refers to the king of Ai.

The phrase *his people, his city, and his land* emphasizes that Yahweh will give Joshua complete victory over every part of Ai. This includes its citizens and all the land that is under the power of the king.

Verses 8:1–9 describe Joshua’s preparations to attack Ai, with details about the ambush. The soldiers in the ambush left by night ahead of the other soldiers. Verses 8:10–27 describe the movement of the soldiers, and the defeat of Ai. Verses 8:28–29 is a summary of the story.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The fall and destruction of Ai

> Israel conquered Ai

#### 8:2a

**And you shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king,**

* You will do the same thing to Ai and its king that you did to Jericho and its king.
* In the same way that you destroyed Jericho and its king, you must destroy Ai and its king.

**And you shall do to Ai and its king:** It is recommended that you begin a new sentence here. The command *you shall do* refers to what the Israelites did in Jericho. In some languages it may be more natural to make explicit what Joshua and the army must do. They must kill the people of Ai, as they killed the people of Jericho. For example:

> Destroy Ai and kill its king as you did at Jericho (CEV)

**as you did to Jericho and its king:** Verse 6:21 said that the Israelites killed the men and women in Jericho with their swords. This is what they must also do to the king of Ai and the citizens.

#### 8:2b

**except that you may carry off their plunder and livestock for yourselves.**

* However, you may take the things in the city and the domestic animals for yourselves.
* But you may take the things there for yourselves, including the cattle and the sheep.

**except:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *except* expresses contrast with what God commanded Israel previously regarding Jericho. Show contrast in a way that is natural in your language.

Here are some other ways to translate this word:

> but

> however

**you may carry off for yourselves:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *carry off for yourselves* is more literally the simple verb “take.” In Jericho all the things belonged to God and the Israelites could not take them. But in Ai the Israelites can take these things for their own use.

Here are some other ways to translate this verb:

> you may keep (these things) for yourselves (GNT)

> you may carry off (these things) for yourselves (NIV)

**their plunder and livestock:** The Hebrew puts the phrase *their plunder and livestock* before “you may carry off for yourselves” in the sentence to show emphasis. You should emphasize this phrase in a way that is natural in your language.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> you may keep the livestock and everything else you want (CEV)

> you may take its loot and livestock for yourselves (GW)

**their plunder:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *plunder* refers to things of value in the town that the Israelites could take.

**livestock:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *livestock* refers to domesticated animals. It can also include sheep and goats.

#### 8:2c

**Set up an ambush behind the city.”**

* Get ready to attack the city by surprise from behind.”
* Tell some of your soldiers to go hide west of the city, so that they can attack it by surprise.”

It is recommended that you begin a new sentence here.

**Set up an ambush behind the city:** The phrase *Set up an ambush* indicates that some of the Israelite soldiers hid so that they could attack Ai by surprise.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> set an ambush behind the city (NET)

> prepare to attack the city by surprise from the rear (GNT)

**behind the city:** The phrase *behind the city* indicates that the purpose of the “ambush” is to attack the town. In 8:9 it is clear that *behind the city* indicates the direction west of the town.

* ¶ So Joshua and all the soldiers started to go up to Ai.
* ¶ So Joshua and all his soldiers got ready to go to Ai.

**So Joshua and the whole army set out:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *set out* shows that a new action is beginning. This verb does not mean that Joshua was lying down.8:3 Bratcher and Newman, p. 105\.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> Joshua and all the fighting men set out to go up against Ai (NRSV)

> Joshua and all the fighting men started to go up to Ai

**and the whole army:** The phrase *the whole army* refers to all the soldiers of Israel.

**to attack Ai:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *to attack* literally means “ascend.” Ai was at a higher elevation than the Israelite camp, and the Hebrew language keeps track of elevation. If your language does not keep track of elevation in this way you can translate it as:

> to go to Ai

> to go and attack Ai

#### 8:3b

**Joshua chose 30,000 mighty men of valor**

* Joshua picked out thirty thousand strong and brave soldiers
* And Joshua chose thirty thousand soldiers who were strong and brave

It is recommended that you begin a new sentence here.

**Joshua chose 30,000 mighty men of valor:** In 4:13 it says that there were forty thousand Israelite soldiers in total. Thirty thousand of them went to hide behind the town, and ten thousand of them stayed with Joshua.

#### 8:4a

**with these orders:**

* Joshua gave them these orders:
* Before they left, Joshua commanded them:

The Hebrew connector that the BSB leaves untranslated but many English versions translate as “And” introduces the next event in the storyline.

**with these orders:** Before they began to walk towards Ai, Joshua explained to them what they must do when they reached the town.

#### 8:4b

**“Pay attention. You are to lie in ambush behind the city,**

* “Listen carefully. You must hide yourselves behind the city.
* “Pay attention. Hide yourselves west of the city.

**Pay attention:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Pay attention* is literally “see.” It shows that what Joshua is about to say is important and that the soldiers should listen carefully. You may have a grammatical particle or another way to mark the importance of a command.

Here are some other ways to translate this word:

> listen carefully (NIV)

> pay attention

**lie in ambush behind the city:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *lie in ambush* indicates that the soldiers hid in order to attack the town by surprise.

**had taken:** There are two ways to interpret the meaning of the verb *had taken*.

1. The form of the verb indicates the next event in the story. For example:

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> every man in Ai went (GNT)

> not a man stayed (NCV)

**in Ai or Bethel:** The word *Bethel* is in the Hebrew text and in most English versions. Some versions omit the word *Bethel* because this town was not mentioned in the preceding verses.

It is recommended that you include the word *Bethel*. The towns of Ai and Bethel were close together. The people of Bethel went to help the men of their neighboring town.8:17 Hess, p. 166\.

* “Stretch out your arm and point the spear that you are holding towards Ai.

**Hold out your battle lance toward Ai:** The clause *Hold out your battle lance toward Ai* indicates that Joshua must extend his arm to its full length with the javelin pointing towards Ai.

**battle lance:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *battle lance* refers to either a short sword used for thrusting and hunting, or a curved, crescent\-shaped sword.8:18 Holladay, p. 156\. These are some other ways that English versions have translated it:

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The fall and destruction of Ai

> Israel conquered Ai

#### 8:19a\-b

Scholars disagree about whether Joshua pointed his javelin toward Ai as a signal to the men who were hiding, or as a symbol of God’s action in defeating the town. It seems likely that it served both functions. It signaled the troops to advance, and it symbolized God’s power and victory over Ai. In 8:19 the focus is on the signal to the soldiers, but 8:26 shows that the outstretched arm is also a symbol of God’s victory.

#### 8:19a

**and as soon as he did so,**

* When Joshua stretched out his hand,
* As soon as Joshua raised his hand,

**and as soon as he did so:** When Joshua stretched out his hand with the lance, it was a signal to the troops to attack. Some English versions make this explicit. For example:

> When the Israelites who were in ambush saw this (NCV)

> As soon as he did this, the men in the ambush rose quickly (NIV)

> as soon as he lifted his hand, the men who had been hiding got up quickly (GNT)

#### 8:19b

**the men in ambush rose quickly from their position.**

* the soldiers who were hiding quickly got up.
* the soldiers behind the city quickly came out from where they were hiding.

**the men in ambush rose quickly from their position:** This clause indicates that the soldiers who were hiding got up from their hiding places. They knew that the time had come to attack the town.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> the men who had been hiding got up quickly (GNT)

##### **General Comment on 8:19a\-b**

In some languages it is more natural to change the order of 19a and b to reflect the order in the original language. For example:

> 19bThe soldiers rose quickly from where they were hiding 19aas soon as Joshua stretched out his hand

#### 8:19c

**They rushed forward, entered the city, captured it,**

* They ran into the city and captured it.

**When the men of Ai turned and looked back,**

* When the soldiers of Ai looked behind them
* Then the men of Ai turned around and looked back toward Ai

**When the men of Ai turned and looked back:** The soldiers of Ai were chasing the Israelite soldiers. At some point, they turned around and looked back towards their town. The story does not say why they looked back. Perhaps they heard noise coming from the direction of the town.

#### 8:20b

**the smoke of the city was rising into the sky.**

* they saw that the sky was filled with smoke.
* and saw smoke rising to the sky because the city was burning.

The Hebrew word that the BSB leaves untranslated but some English versions translate as “behold” is used to emphasize what happens next. You may have a word or particle in your language that is used for emphasis. Many English versions do not translate this word. It may be more natural to leave this word implicit.

> they had no chance to escape in any direction (NIV)

> they had nowhere to go (NLT)

**They could not escape:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *They could not* implies a loss of courage. Some English versions make this explicit. For example:

#### 8:20d

**and the troops who had fled to the wilderness now became the pursuers.**

* because the Israelites who led them to the wilderness turned back on them.
* because the Israelites who ran away toward the wilderness now turned around to attack them.

**and the troops who had fled to the wilderness now became the pursuers:** The clause *and the troops who had fled to the wilderness* refers to Joshua and the Israelite soldiers who had pretended to run away. These are the same people referred to in 8:15\.

**now became the pursuers:** The phrase that the BSB translates as *became the pursuers* is translated as “turned back against the pursuers” in most English versions. With either interpretation, the Israelite soldiers who had run away from the town now turned around and fought with the soldiers of Ai.

**the pursuers:** According to the BSB interpretation, the phrase *the pursuers* refers to Joshua and the Israelite soldiers who had pretended to run away. However, most English versions indicate that *the pursuers* refers to the soldiers of Ai.

* in the wilderness to which the Israelites led them.

**who had pursued them into the field and wilderness:** In 8:15 Joshua and his army pretended to be afraid and ran away into the wilderness between Ai and the Jordan River Valley. In 8:20 the soldiers of Ai chased them there. In this verse the roles are reversed. Israel chased the soldiers of Ai and killed them. This change of roles adds dramatic impact to this turning point in the story.

**who had pursued them:** Scholars and English versions differ on who *who* and *them* refer to.

1. The word *them* refers to the Israelite soldiers and *who* refers to the soldiers of Ai. For example:

    > When the Israelite army finished chasing and killing all the men of Ai in the open fields (NLT) *(BSB, NLT, RSV, NIV, NASB, NCV, NJB, REB, GNT, CEV, KJV)*

2. The word *them* refers to the soldiers of Ai and *who* refers to the Israelite soldiers. For example:

    > When Israel had finished killing all the men of Ai who had chased them toward the desert (NET) *(NET, GW, NJPS)*

The Hebrew text is not clear on this issue. It is recommended that you follow option (1\) along with the majority of English versions. As noted above, option (1\) adds impact to this climactic turn of events where Israel is now the victor.

**into the field and wilderness:** The phrase *the field and wilderness* refers to the barren, uninhabited country that was mentioned in 8:15\.

#### 8:24c

**and when every last one of them had fallen by the sword,**

* They killed them all. Not one of them lived.
* They killed every single one of them.

**and when every last one of them:** The phrase *every last one of them* refers to the fighting men of Ai. This phrase indicates that not one of the soldiers of Ai was left. They were all dead.

**had fallen by the sword:** The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as *had fallen by the sword* is more literally “had fallen by the mouth of the sword.” This is a Hebrew idiom. It means that the Israelite soldiers killed them.

This is a passive clause. The Israelites are the implied subject. The Israelite soldiers killed the men of Ai.

Here are some other ways to translate this Hebrew idiom:

> they had been put to the sword (NIV)

> they put them all to death (GW)

> The Israelites killed every one of the enemy (GNT)

#### 8:24d

**all the Israelites returned to Ai and put it to the sword as well.**

* Then the Israelites went back to Ai and killed everyone left there with their swords.
* Then the Israelite army returned to Ai and killed everyone who was still alive in the city.

**all the Israelites returned to Ai and put it to the sword as well:** This clause indicates that the Israelite army killed the people who were still left in the town of Ai, the women and children.

### Section 8:1–29 Israel defeated Ai.

In chapter 7, Israel attacked Ai and the soldiers of Ai defeated them. They were discouraged but they repented of their sin. In chapter 8, God told Joshua to attack Ai again. This time, the Israelites were victorious and defeated Ai.

Verses 8:1–9 describe Joshua’s preparations to attack Ai, with details about the ambush. The soldiers in the ambush left by night ahead of the other soldiers. Verses 8:10–27 describe the movement of the soldiers, and the defeat of Ai. Verses 8:28–29 is a summary of the story.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The fall and destruction of Ai

> Israel conquered Ai

#### 8:25

**A total of twelve thousand men and women fell that day—all the people of Ai.**

* All the people of Ai died that day. There were twelve thousand men and women.
* Twelve thousand men and women from Ai died that day. All the people of Ai died.

**A total of twelve thousand men and women fell that day—all the people of Ai:** This verse is a summary of the outcome of the battle between the Israelites and the citizens of Ai. The summary statement as introduced in Hebrew with the words “and it was.” The NLT introduces this summary statement with the word:

> So (NLT)

Translate the summary statement in a way that is natural in your language.

**A total of twelve thousand…all the people of Ai:** The total population of Ai, including men and women, numbered twelve thousand people. All of these people died.

**men and women fell that day:** The phrase *men and women fell that day* refers to the people who died that day.

**men and women:** The phrase *men and women* refers to the *men* who had gone out to battle and the *women* who had stayed in the town.

#### 8:26a

**Joshua did not draw back the hand that held his battle lance**

* Joshua kept holding out his sword
* Joshua kept his arm stretched out with the spear in his hand pointed toward Ai

The Hebrew conjunction that BSB leaves untranslated but many English versions translate as “For” introduces the reason why the Israelites could destroy Ai. You should indicate reason in a natural way in your language. It some languages it may be most natural to use no connecting word, as in many English versions.

**Joshua did not draw back the hand:** This clause indicates that Joshua continued to stretch out his arm.

**that held his battle lance:** Joshua stretched out his arm while he held the battle lance in his hand, and pointed the lance towards Ai.

**battle lance:** Translate the phrase *battle lance* the same way as you did in 8:18\.

It was important that Joshua keep his arm stretched out and point the battle lance towards Ai until all the people of Ai were dead. This was what Yahweh commanded him to do. This was a symbol that it was Yahweh who won the victory over Ai and not the Israelites themselves.

#### 8:26b

**until he had devoted to destruction all who lived in Ai.**

* until they killed all the people of Ai.
* until the Israelite army killed every person in the city.

**until he had devoted to destruction all who lived in Ai:** It may be necessary to make explicit the implied information that Joshua did not kill the people himself. The Israelite soldiers followed his orders and killed every Ai person. For example, you could say:

> until the Israelite soldiers destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai

Many English versions use a passive verb. For example:

> until all who lived in Ai had been destroyed (REB)

Translate this in a way that is natural in your language.

**Israel took for themselves only the cattle and plunder of that city,**

* But the Israelites took for themselves the livestock and the goods in the city,
* But the Israelites kept the animals and other things from Ai,

**Israel took for themselves only the cattle and plunder of that city:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *only* marks a contrast. They killed the people of Ai, but they took the cattle. Another way to mark this contrast is with the word “but.” For example:

> But the Israelites took the animals and other possessions of the people of Ai (CEV)

**Israel:** The word *Israel* refers to the soldiers of Israel.

**took for themselves:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *took for themselves* is more literally “take.”

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> The Israelites kept for themselves the livestock and goods (GNT)

> Israel did carry off for themselves the livestock and plunder (NIV)

**the cattle:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *cattle* is more literally “livestock.” It refer to cattle and to other domestic animals such as sheep and goats.

Here are some other ways to translate this word:

> animals

> domestic animals

**plunder:** The word *plunder* refers to the things in the town that were not burned when the army set fire to the town.

#### 8:27b

**as the LORD had commanded Joshua.**

* as Yahweh told Joshua.
* because this is what Yahweh told Joshua they could do.

**as the LORD had commanded Joshua:** This clause is a reminder about verse 8:2\. At that time Yahweh told Joshua that the Israelites could take the goods and animals of Ai for themselves.

#### 8:28b

**and made it a permanent heap of ruins, a desolation to this day.**

* It has remained a pile of ruins, up to today.
* and made it a heap of ruins. It is still like that now.

**and made it a permanent heap of ruins:** The Israelites burned the buildings and everything in Ai so that it was a pile of rubble. The name “Ai” in Hebrew means *ruins*. It is recommended that you add a footnote to explain that this is a word play. For example:

> FOOTNOTE: The name Ai means “ruins”

**a desolation to this day:** The phrase *this day* refers to the time that the author wrote the book of Joshua. At that time it was still a heap of ruins

##### **General Comment on 8:28**

Verse 8:28 is a summary statement about the battle of Ai. The burning of Ai is mentioned three times in this chapter. The first mention, in 8:8, is part of God’s command to Israel. The next mention, in 8:19, reports that the soldiers burned the town. The final mention in this verse is the summary of what Israel did to Ai. The Israelites burned Ai only once. Make sure that is clear in your translation.

**He hung the king of Ai on a tree until evening,**

* Joshua hung the king of Ai’s dead body on a pole and left him there until evening.
* Joshua ordered his soldiers to kill the king of Ai and hang his dead body on a tree.

**He hung the king of Ai on a tree until evening:** It is most likely that Joshua ordered his soldiers to kill the king. Then his dead body was hung on a tree. This was a common practice in the Ancient Near East.8:29 Hess, p. 170\. The bodies of defeated enemies were hung up as an example to others of what might happen to them.

**until evening:** The phrase *until evening* means until the sun went down.

#### 8:29b

**and at sunset Joshua commanded that**

* When the sun went down, Joshua gave the order
* At sunset, Joshua commanded his soldiers

**and at sunset:** It may be more natural to begin a new sentence here. For example:

> When the sun was setting

**Joshua commanded:** It may be necessary to make explicit to whom Joshua gave the command. He commanded some of his soldiers. For example:

> Joshua told his soldiers

#### 8:29c

**they take down the body from the tree**

* to take the king’s dead body down from the tree.
* to take his body down.

**that they take down the body from the tree:** The Israelite soldiers took the dead body of the king down from the tree on which it was hanging.

#### 8:29d

## Joshua 8:30 (id: 516164)

### Section 8:30–35 Joshua read the law of Moses to the Israelites.

In this section the people of Israel built an altar to Yahweh and made sacrifices to him. Joshua had them write the law of Moses on stone tablets. Then all the people assembled at Mount Ebal and Mount Gerazim while Joshua read the law aloud to them. He read all of its blessings and its curses.

Before they crossed the Jordan River, Moses foretold this event. He gave them detailed instructions for how they should do this in Deuteronomy 27:1–13\. Now that the Israelites were well established in the land of Canaan they followed the instructions of Moses.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Reading the law at Mount Ebal and Mount Gerazim

> Joshua reads the blessings and the curses to the people

#### 8:30a

**At that time Joshua built an altar on Mount Ebal**

* ¶ Then Joshua built an altar on Mount Ebal
* ¶ Some time later, Joshua told the Israelites to build an altar on Mount Ebal

**At that time Joshua built an altar on Mount Ebal:** There was probably a period of several days between the fight against Ai, and the time when Joshua built the altar to Yahweh.8:30 Bratcher and Newman, p. 119\. If the phrase *At that time* suggests that this happened immediately after Ai, it may be better to add a phrase such as:

> some time later

> on another day

**Joshua:** The Hebrew text says that Joshua built the altar. It is most likely that he told some of the Israelites to build the altar for him. You may want to make this explicit. For example:

> he told some of his men, “Build an altar for offering sacrifices to the Lord” (CEV)

**built an altar:** This altar was made by piling up stones. It is different from the altar of burnt offering that was inside the tent of meeting. That altar was made of acacia wood overlaid with bronze. See Exodus 38:1–7\.

Verse 8:31 says that the altar was made of stones that were not cut with a tool. Do not use a word for *built* in your language which implies that tools were used.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> made an altar

> piled stones up as an altar

**on Mount Ebal:** The altar was on the top of Mount Ebal. It was not buried inside it. The Hebrew preposition that the BSB translates as *on* is translated that way by most English versions. Use a preposition that is appropriate in your language.

**Mount Ebal:** *Mount Ebal* is about 32 kilometers north of Ai.8:30 Boling, p. 247\.

#### 8:30b

**to the LORD, the God of Israel,**

* to Yahweh, the God of Israel.

**to the LORD, the God of Israel:** They built the altar so that they could make sacrifices to Yahweh on it. Yahweh is given this extended title for emphasis. You should translate this phrase consistently with the decisions you have made about translating the name of God throughout the Old Testament.

#### 8:31a

**just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the Israelites.**

* This was what Moses, Yahweh’s servant, commanded the Israelites.
* He followed the instructions that Moses, the servant of Yahweh, gave the Israelites

**just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the Israelites:** Moses gave the Israelites this command in Deuteronomy 27:1–13\. It may be clearer to translate this dependent clause as an independent sentence. For example, you could say:

> This is what Moses, the servant of Yahweh, commanded the Israelites to do

**Moses the servant of the LORD:** Translate the title *servant of the LORD* as you did in 1:1\.

#### 8:31b

**He built it according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses:**

* Joshua obeyed these instructions from the book of Moses’ teachings which say:
* in the law of Moses. It says there:

**He built it according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses:** The phrase *the Book of the Law of Moses* refers to Deuteronomy, where these instructions were written down.

**the Book of the Law of Moses:** The phrase *Law of Moses* refers to the teachings, or instructions, of Moses.

#### 8:31c

**“an altar of uncut stones on which no iron tool has been used.”**

* “The altar must be made from stones that have not been cut or shaped by an iron tool.”
* “Make an altar from stones that are uncut and that nobody has touched with iron tools.”

**an altar of uncut stones on which no iron tool has been used:** There is implied information. Joshua made an altar of unhewn stones. It may be more natural to state this information as an independent sentence. For example:

> Joshua built an altar out of stones that had not been cut with an iron tool

**uncut stones:** The phrase *uncut stones* can also be translated as “unhewn stones.” It indicates that no one used any tool to chisel the stones or cut them up. An “altar of uncut stones” is mentioned in Exodus 20:25 and in Deuteronomy 27:5\.

**no iron tool has been used:** The clause *no iron tool has been used* indicates that no person used a tool to cut or shape the stones.

#### 8:31d

**And on it they offered burnt offerings to the LORD,**

* On the altar they offered to Yahweh burnt offerings
* Then the Israelites made sacrifices that are completely burnt on the altar to Yahweh,

**And on it they offered burnt offerings to the LORD:** Probably the priests offered the sacrifices on behalf of the Israelites. It may be more natural in some languages to make this explicit. For example:

> and the priests offered burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar

**burnt offerings:** The phrase *burnt offerings* refers to animals that were totally burned up as an atonement for sins. See Leviticus 1:1–17 for more information about burnt offerings.

#### 8:31e

**and they sacrificed peace offerings.**

* and fellowship offerings.
* and they made sacrifices of fellowship with Yahweh.

**and they sacrificed peace offerings:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *sacrificed* describes the same action as “offered burnt offerings” in 8:31d. It may be clearer in some languages to use the same verb to refer to both sacrifices.

**peace offerings:** The phrase *peace offerings* refers to sacrifices in which only part of the animal was burned. The rest of the animal was eaten by the worshipers.8:31 Bratcher and Newman, p. 119\. Many English versions refer to these offerings as “fellowship offerings.” The person who ate the animal had fellowship with Yahweh. See Leviticus 3:1–17 for more information about peace offerings.

#### 8:32a

**And there in the presence of the Israelites,**

* There on Mount Ebal, while the Israelites watched,
* At that place, while the Israelites were there,

**And there:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *there* refers to the site of the altar on Mount Ebal. The ceremony at this place represents a climax for Israel because it fulfilled Moses’ command in Deuteronomy 27\.

**in the presence of the Israelites:** The phrase *in the presence of the Israelites* indicates that Joshua wrote a copy of the law while all the Israelites watched him.

#### 8:32b

**Joshua inscribed on the stones a copy of the law of Moses,**

* he wrote a copy of the law on some flat stones.
* Joshua wrote on stones a copy of the teachings of Moses.

**Joshua inscribed on the stones a copy of the law of Moses:** The word that the BSB translates as *Joshua* is literally the pronoun “he.” Use the word that would be most natural in your language.

**the stones:** In Deuteronomy 27:2–4 Moses told Joshua to write the law of Moses on large stones which they should first coat with plaster. The term *the stones* does not refer to the stones used to build the altar.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> he wrote on some flat stones

> he chose some flat stones and wrote on them

**a copy of the law of Moses:** The stones were not large enough for the entire *law of Moses*, which is Genesis through Deuteronomy. Joshua copied some part of the law of Moses onto the stones, perhaps the Ten Commandments.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> he copied parts of the book of the Law of Moses onto the stones (CEV)

#### 8:32c

**which he had written.**

* This was the law which Moses wrote for them.
* These are the teachings that Moses gave them.

**which he had written:** It is not clear in the Hebrew text whether the pronoun *he* refers to Joshua or to Moses. It is recommended that you translate the pronoun *he* as referring to Moses, as in the NET, NJB, NJPS, NLT, and GNT.

> which Moses had written (GNT)

> the instructions Moses had given them (NLT)

* All the Israelites, foreigners and native\-born, together with their leaders and officers and judges,
* Then all the Israelites, those who had Israelite parents and those who were foreigners living among them, along with the elders, officers, and judges,

The Hebrew connector that the BSB leaves untranslated but many English versions translate as “and” indicates the next event of the story.

**All Israel, foreigners and citizens alike:** The phrase *All Israel* indicates that every Israelite was present at the ceremony.

**foreigners and citizens alike:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *foreigners* refers to foreigners who lived in the Israelite community.8:33 Howard, p. 216\.

The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *citizens* refers to Israelites who were descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.

Here are some other ways to translate these two words:

> resident foreigners and native Israelites (NET)

> aliens and citizens (NIV)

> foreigners and native\-born (NLT)

**with their elders, officers, and judges:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *elders* refers to the leaders of tribes and families who represented their tribe on special occasions.8:33 Woudstra, p. 139\.

**officers:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *officers* refers to people who had both military and administrative responsibilities.8:33 Woudstra, p. 64, footnote 1\.

Here are some other ways to translate this term:

> leaders (NET)

> officials (NIV)

**stood on both sides of the ark of the covenant of the LORD facing the Levitical priests**

* stood in two groups. One group stood on each side of the ark facing the priests, the Levites.
* were divided into two groups. Each group faced inward toward the ark.They were facing the priests,

**stood on both sides of the ark of the covenant of the LORD:** The clause *stood on both sides of the ark* indicates that the Israelites stood in two groups facing each other. The *ark* was in\-between them.

**the ark of the covenant of the LORD:** The *ark* was a wooden box that was a sign of God’s presence. The term *ark* has different descriptive phrases attached to it in different contexts. In this verse it is called *ark of the covenant of the LORD*. This emphasizes that inside it were the stone tablets on which Moses wrote the Ten commandments, the symbol of Yahweh’s covenant with Israel.

**facing the Levitical priests:** Two *Levitical priests* stood at each end of the ark, carrying it on poles over their shoulders. The two groups of Israelites faced the ark and the priests who carried it.

**Levitical priests:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *Levitical priests* is literally “the priests, the Levites.” The priests were descendants of Levi, and belonged to the tribe of Levi.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> the priests, the Levites

> the priests of the Levi tribe

It is also possible to say just “the priests,” and put the literal translation in a footnote. See how you translated this term in Joshua 3:3\.

**priests:** The *priests* were people who offered sacrifices to God on behalf of the people. You should translate this the same way you do in the New Testament. See, for example, Mark 1:44\.

#### 8:33c

**who carried it.**

* The priests were carrying the ark of Yahweh’s covenant.
* the Levites who held the ark of the covenant of Yahweh.

**who carried it:** It was the responsibility of the priests to carry the ark of the covenant.

#### 8:33d

**Half of the people stood in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal,**

* Half of the people stood on the slope of Mount Gerizim and the other half on the slope of Mount Ebal.
* Half of the people stood in front of Mount Gerizim and half stood in front of Mount Ebal.

**Half of the people stood in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal:** The phrase *half of them* indicates that the Israelites were divided into two large groups.

**in front of Mount Gerizim and…in front of Mount Ebal:** The Israelites stood in the Valley of Shechem, which was between the two mountains, *Mount Gerizim* and *Mount Ebal*. One group stood facing Mount Gerizim and the other group stood facing Mount Ebal.

In Deuteronomy 27:12–13 Moses told the people to stand “on” Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, whereas this verse uses the words *in front of*. Because the Israelites followed the commands that Moses gave them, it may be that they stood on the slopes of the two mountains, facing in the direction of the opposite mountain. For example:

> on the upper slopes of Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal (NJB)

#### 8:33e

**as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded earlier,**

* This was what Moses, the servant of Yahweh originally commanded them.
* This was done according to the instructions that Moses, Yahweh’s servant, previously gave them.

**as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded earlier:** This indicates that the Israelites obeyed the instructions that Moses gave them before he died.

**earlier:** The word *earlier* refers to the time when Moses gave the Israelites this command in Deuteronomy 27:12–13\. For example:

> the Lord’s servant Moses had earlier commanded the people (NCV)

In this section the people of Israel built an altar to Yahweh and made sacrifices to him. Joshua had them write the law of Moses on stone tablets. Then all the people assembled at Mount Ebal and Mount Gerazim while Joshua read the law aloud to them. He read all of its blessings and its curses.

Before they crossed the Jordan River, Moses foretold this event. He gave them detailed instructions for how they should do this in Deuteronomy 27:1–13\. Now that the Israelites were well established in the land of Canaan they followed the instructions of Moses.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Reading the law at Mount Ebal and Mount Gerazim

> Joshua reads the blessings and the curses to the people

#### 8:34a

**Afterward, Joshua read aloud all the words of the law—the blessings and the curses—**

* Then Joshua read the whole Law of Moses, including the blessings and the curses
* Then Joshua read out loud the entire teachings of Moses, including the blessings and the curses

**Afterward:** The word *Afterward* refers to the time after the people arranged themselves in the two groups. Many English versions use the word “then” to signal this next event. Use the connecting word that is most natural in your language to indicate this.

**Joshua read aloud all the words of the law:** The clause *Joshua read aloud all the words of the law* indicates that Joshua read aloud the entire teachings of Moses.

**the blessings and the curses:** The phrase *the blessings and the curses* refers to the words of Moses in Deuteronomy 27:12–28:68\. Moses said that they would receive blessings if they obeyed Yahweh, but they would experience curses if they did not obey him.

#### 8:34b

**according to all that is written in the Book of the Law.**

* as Moses wrote them down.
* as they are written in the book of the law.

**according to all that is written in the Book of the Law:** The phrase *according to all that is written in the Book of the Law* repeats 8:34a in different words. The information that Joshua read the entire Book of the Law is repeated to emphasize its importance. Find a way to emphasize the reading of the law that is natural in your language.

### Section 8:30–35 Joshua read the law of Moses to the Israelites.

In this section the people of Israel built an altar to Yahweh and made sacrifices to him. Joshua had them write the law of Moses on stone tablets. Then all the people assembled at Mount Ebal and Mount Gerazim while Joshua read the law aloud to them. He read all of its blessings and its curses.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Reading the law at Mount Ebal and Mount Gerazim

> Joshua reads the blessings and the curses to the people

#### 8:35a

**There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded**

* There was not one of the words of Moses
* Joshua read every one of Moses’ commandments

**There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded:** The phrase *not a word of all that Moses had commanded* emphasizes again that Joshua read all Moses’ teaching for the Israelites. This information is given again in this verse to emphasize how important the reading of the law was.

#### 8:35b

**that Joshua failed to read before the whole assembly of Israel,**

* which Joshua did not read to all the people of Israel.
* while the entire population of the Israelites listened.

**that Joshua failed to read before the whole assembly of Israel:** In the previous verse, the information that Joshua read the entire law is stated in a positive manner. Now it is restated using a double negative for extra emphasis. In some languages a double negative may convey a wrong meaning. Use a natural means to emphasize that Joshua read the entire law to the Israelites. For example, the GNT states 8:35a\-b in a positive way:

> Every one of the commandments of Moses was read by Joshua to the whole gathering (GNT)

**before the whole assembly of Israel:** The phrase *before the whole assembly of Israel* indicates that Joshua read Moses’ teachings while all the Israelites stood and listened.

#### 8:35c

**including the women, the little ones, and the foreigners who lived among them.**

* All the people listened, including the women and the children and the foreigners who lived with them.
* This included the women and children, as well as the foreigners living among them.

**including the women, the little ones:** The phrase *including the women, the little ones* indicates that women and children were present and listened while Joshua read the law. Women and children were not present at every gathering. The author includes this information to show that the entire population of Israel listened while Joshua read aloud the law.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> including the women and the children

**and the foreigners who lived among them:** The *foreigners* were foreigners who lived with the Israelites. They were not Israelites by birth.8:35 Howard, p. 216–217\.

##### **General Comment on verse 8:35**

It may be more natural in some languages to reorder the parts of this verse so that 8:35c is first, as in the NCV:

> 35bAll the Israelites were gathered together\-\-35cmen, women and children, along with the non\-Israelites who lived among them. 35aJoshua read every command that Moses had given. (NCV)

## Joshua 9:1 (id: 516176)

### Section 9:1–27 The Gibeonites deceived the Israelites

The Gibeonite people lived near Ai. When they heard that Joshua had defeated Ai, they were afraid that he would conquer and kill them too. So, they sent messengers who pretended they had come from a long distance away. They deceived the Israelites and made a treaty of friendship with them.

Later, the Israelites learned that the Gibeonites lied to them, and that they lived quite close to them. They could not kill them because of the treaty, so they made them be water carriers and woodcutters for the Israelites.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The people of Gibeon

> The Gibeon people tricked the Israelites and made a treaty with them

### Paragraph 9:1–2

This paragraph forms an introduction to the story of this chapter. It tells how a group of kings from the nearby towns decided to fight together against the Israelites. Their action contrasts with how the Gibeonites deceived the Israelites.

#### 9:1a

**Now when news of this reached all the kings west of the Jordan—**

* ¶ All the kings who ruled the cities west of the Jordan River heard about the Israelites.
* ¶ When all the kings west of the Jordan River heard that the Israelites lost a battle at Ai

**Now when news of this reached:** The words *of this* are not included in the Hebrew text. The Hebrew text says only, “When all the kings heard.” In some languages it may be clearer to add words about what the kings heard.

These kings heard something that made them decide to join forces and attack the Israelites. Probably they heard how Joshua and the Israelites were defeated in the first battle of Ai. Because they saw that it was possible for the Israelites to lose a battle, they decided to attack them.9:1 Howard, p. 218; Hess, p. 175\.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> When the kings heard about the Israelites they gathered together

> When the kings heard that the Israelites lost a battle against Ai, they gathered together

**all the kings west of the Jordan:** The phrase *the kings west of the Jordan* refers to the kings who ruled towns on the west side of the Jordan River. It may be clearer to add the implied information in this clause. For example:

> the kings of the towns beyond the Jordan River

> the kings of the towns west of the Jordan River

**west of the Jordan:** The phrase *west of the Jordan* refers to the region west of the Jordan River.

#### 9:1b

**those in the hill country, the foothills, and all along the coast of the Great Sea toward Lebanon**

* They are the kings in the mountains and the lower slopes and on the Mediterranean seacoast northwards toward Lebanon,
* (they are the kings in the mountain country, the foothills to the west, and on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea up north towards Lebanon,

**those in the hill country:** The term *hill country* refers to the central mountain range of Palestine.

**the foothills:** The term *foothills* refers to the western side of the central mountain range. It is a rocky plateau that is higher than the land near the Mediterranean Sea, but lower than the hill country.

Here are some other ways to translate this word:

> western foothills (NIV)

> the lowland (RSV)

**and all along the coast of the Great Sea:** The phrase *Great Sea* refers to the Mediterranean Sea.

**toward Lebanon:** *Lebanon* was a small but powerful kingdom to the north of Palestine. The phrase *toward Lebanon* indicates that some of these kings were from the north, near the kingdom of Lebanon.

#### 9:1c

**(the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites)—**

* namely, the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
* the kings who ruled the Heth people, the Amor people, the Canaan people, the Periz people, the Hiw people, and the Yabus people),

**the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites:** These six groups of people were mentioned in 3:10\. You should translate them the same way you did there. These people are inhabitants of the land of Canaan. In Deuteronomy 20:16–18 Yahweh told the Israelites to destroy these nations with his help.

##### **General Comment on 9:1**

This is a long sentence with a long and complicated subject. It may be clearer to break it into two sentences. For example:

> 1aThere were many people who lived on the west side of the Jordan River, 1bin the hill country, and in the foothills, and along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea and up north toward Lebanon. 1cThe kings of the Hitti people, the Amor people, the Canaan people, the Periz people, the Hiw people, and the Yabus people 1aheard about the Israelites.

#### 9:2

**they came together to wage war against Joshua and Israel.**

* Then they agreed to join together in fighting Joshua and the Israelite army.
* they got together and agreed to fight against Joshua and the Israelites.

**they came together:** The clause *they came together* indicates that the kings and their armies joined as one group to fight the Israelites.

**together:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *together* is more literally “one mouth.” This means that all the kings agreed to do this.

**to wage war against Joshua and Israel:** The clause *to wage war against Joshua and Israel* indicates that the kings agreed that they and their armies would fight against Joshua and his army, the Israelites.

#### 9:3a

**But the people of Gibeon, having heard**

* ¶ But when the people in the city of Gibeon heard the news
* ¶ The people of Gibeon City heard

**But:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *But* shows that there is a contrast between what the six kings did and what the Gibeonites did. Show this contrast in a natural way in your language.

**the people of Gibeon, having heard:** The phrase *people of Gibeon* refers to the people who lived in the town of Gibeon. They are also referred to as “Gibeonites.” Gibeon town was about twenty kilometers west of Ai town.9:3 Howard, p. 223\.

#### 9:3b

**what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai,**

* that Joshua and the Israelites defeated the cities of Jericho and Ai,
* how Joshua defeated Jericho and Ai.

**what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai:** The clause *what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai* refers to Joshua’s victories over these two towns. The Israelite army, with Joshua as their leader, defeated the armies of both Jericho and Ai.

#### 9:4a\-b

**acted deceptively and set out as envoys:** There is a Hebrew phrase near the beginning of this verse, which the BSB leaves implicit, that can be translated as “also they.” This phrase contrasts the Gibeonites with the kings mentioned in 9:1–2\. Translate this phrase with whatever lexical or grammatical means is most natural to show this contrast.

#### 9:4a

**acted deceptively**

* they decided to deceive the Israelites.
* So they used a deception.

**acted deceptively:** The phrase *acted deceptively* indicates that the Gibeonites deceived the Israelites.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> they deceived the Israelites

> they did a trick/deception/scheme

#### 9:4b

**and set out as envoys,**

* They packed up food for a journey
* They got together some food

**set out as envoys:** There is a textual issue with the phrase *set out as envoys*.

1. Some Hebrew manuscripts have a verb that means “made ready provisions.” For example:

    > they provided themselves with supplies (NJB) *(NJB, RSV, NRSV, ESV, NAB, NCV, NET, GNT)*

2. The Hebrew Masoretic Text uses a verb that occurs only here. Some scholars think this verb means “to act as an ambassador,” but the meaning is uncertain. The NIV is an example of an English version that follows this interpretation:

    > they went as a delegation (NIV) *(BSB, NIV, CEV, GW, NASB, NLT, BSB)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\) along with a majority of English versions.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> they packed food to take on a journey

> They went and got some food (GNT)

#### 9:4c

**carrying on their donkeys worn\-out sacks**

* and put it in old sacks for their donkeys to carry,
* and used old bags to put it in on their donkeys.

**carrying on their donkeys:** The phrase *on their donkeys* means that they carried the sacks on the backs of their donkeys.

**donkeys:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *donkeys* is translated “asses” in some English versions. The word “ass” is from old English.9:4 The word “ass” can have vulgar connotations in English.

**worn\-out sacks:** The phrase *worn\-out sacks* indicates that they used old sacks to carry things on their donkeys. The sacks were worn thin from much use.

#### 9:4d

**and old wineskins, cracked and mended.**

* They put wine in old wineskins that were torn and mended.
* Their leather bags for wine were old and torn and mended.

**and old wineskins, cracked and mended:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *wineskins* refers to leather bags that were used to carry wine. The wineskins, like the sacks, were old and in poor condition.

**They put worn, patched sandals on their feet and threadbare clothing on their bodies,**

* They put worn and patched sandals on their feet and wore worn\-out clothes.
* They wore sandals that were old and patched, and clothes that were worn\-out.

**They put worn, patched sandals on their feet and threadbare clothing on their bodies:** It may be more natural in some languages to translate this as an independent sentence. For example:

> They put on ragged clothes and worn\-out sandals that had been mended (GNT)

> The men put worn and patched sandals on their feet and wore old clothes (NIV)

#### 9:5b

**and their whole supply of bread was dry and moldy.**

* All their bread was dried out and hard.
* Their bread was dry and crumbly.

**and their whole supply of bread was dry and moldy:** The phrase *their whole supply of bread* refers to the bread they took with them to eat.

**moldy:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *moldy* is rarely used. Bible scholars and the English versions disagree about its meaning.

1. It means crumbly or hard rather than *moldy*. This seems likely because mold requires moisture for growth, and the climate in Palestine is very dry.9:5 Howard, p. 223\. For example:

    > And all their provisions were dry and crumbly. (ESV) *(ESV, GW, NAB, NASB, NET, NJB, NJPS, REB, CEV)*

2. It means moldy. For example:

    > All the bread of their food supply was dry and moldy. (NIV) *(BSB, NIV, RSV, NCV, NLT, GNT)*

It is difficult to know the meaning of this word because it is rare. It occurs only three times in the Old Testament (Joshua 9:5, 12, and I Kings 13:4\). Both options are used by English versions. Even though Palestine generally had a dry climate, there was also a wet season and old bread could get moldy. Either option is acceptable.

* ¶ Then they went to meet Joshua in the Israelite camp at Gilgal,
* ¶ When the Gibeonites arrived at the Israelite camp at Gilgal,

**They went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal:** After the Gibeonite men got their things together, they traveled to the Israelite camp at Gilgal to talk to Joshua.

**Gilgal:** Gilgal was first mentioned in 4:19\. You should translate it the same way you did there.

#### 9:6b

**and said to him and the men of Israel,**

* and said to Joshua and the Israelite leaders:
* they spoke to Joshua and the Israelite leaders and said:

**and said to him and the men of Israel:** The Gibeonite men met with Joshua and the Israelites. The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *men of Israel* is more literally “man of Israel.” This is a collective term that is frequently used for the Israelite army.9:6 Howard, p. 224\. The phrase *men of Israel* probably refers to the leaders of the Israelites, rather than to all the male Israelites.

#### 9:6c

**“We have come from a distant land; please make a treaty with us.”**

* “We(excl) have come from a country that is far from here. Please make(plur) a peace treaty with us(excl).”
* “We have come from a distant land. We want you to make a treaty with us.”

**We have come from a distant land:** The Gibeonites claimed that they had traveled a long distance and lived far away from the land of Canaan.

**We:** The word *We* is exclusive. It refers to the Gibeonites and not to the Israelites.

**please make a treaty with us:** The clause *make a treaty with us* is a request for the Israelites to make a treaty or agreement of friendship with them. A *treaty* is a formal agreement between two people or groups of people.

**But the men of Israel said to the Hivites,**

* The Israelites said to the Hivites:
* But the Israelites said to the Gibeonites, who were also called Hivites:

**But the men of Israel:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *men of Israel* is more literally “man of Israel.” This is a collective term that is frequently used for the Israelite army. The phrase *men of Israel* probably refers to the leaders of the Israelites.

**said to the Hivites:** The Gibeonites were one part of the “Hivite” nation. God ordered Israel to destroy this nation in 3:10\. This group of people was also mentioned in 9:1\. You should translate the word *Hivites* the same way you translated it earlier.

#### 9:7b

**“Perhaps you dwell near us. How can we make a treaty with you?”**

* “Perhaps you really live near to us. If that is so, we cannot make a treaty with you.”
* “We want to know for sure that you really live far from us. We cannot make a treaty with anyone who lives in the land of Canaan.”

**Perhaps you dwell near us. How can we make a treaty with you?:** In Deuteronomy 7:1–7 Yahweh told the Israelites that they must not make any treaties with the people who lived in the land of Canaan. This question shows that the Israelites were suspicious of the Gibeonites’ statement that they came from a far away country. The Israelites wanted to make sure it was true. It may be more natural in some languages to translate this question as a statement. For example:

> But maybe you really live near us. We can’t make a peace treaty with you if you live nearby. (CEV)

> We(excl) want to know for sure that you(plur) do not live near us. We cannot make a treaty with any one who lives in the land of Canaan.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> we are willing to be your subjects (NET)

> we acknowledge you as our masters

**they said to Joshua:** The word *they* refers to the Gibeonites. It may be helpful to make this explicit.

#### 9:8b

**Then Joshua asked them, “Who are you and where have you come from?”**

* Then Joshua asked them: “What nationality are you? Where exactly do you come from?”
* Joshua said to them: “I must know for sure what city and nation you come from.”

**Then:** The word *Then* indicates the next event in the storyline. Indicate this in a natural way in your language.

**Who are you and where have you come from?:** The question *Who are you…?* indicates that Joshua wanted to know their nationality. The question *where have you come from?* indicates that Joshua wanted to know where the Gibeonites lived. These two questions together emphasize that Joshua wanted to be sure about who these men were. It may be more natural in some languages to combine these two questions in a way that shows this emphasis. For example:

> Tell me from exactly from where you have come.

> I must know for sure from what town and nation you have come.

* The Gibeonites answered: “We are your servants. We have come from a very far country

**Your servants have come from a very distant land:** The Gibeonites lied to Joshua so that they could make a treaty with the Israelites. The phrase *from a very distant land* is placed at the beginning of the sentence in the Hebrew text to emphasize it. If a location phrase at the beginning of the sentence is not natural, you should use some other means in your language to show this emphasis.

**they replied:** In some languages it may be more natural to translate the word *replied* as “answered.”

#### 9:9b

**“because of the fame of the LORD your God.**

* because we heard of the fame of Yahweh your God.
* because of the reputation of your God, Yahweh.

**because of the fame of the LORD your God:** The phrase *the fame of the LORD your God* refers to the reputation, or name, that Yahweh had because of the miracles he did for the Israelites. He made it possible for them to leave Egypt and then to defeat the kings of the Amorites.

#### 9:9c

**For we have heard the reports about Him: all that He did in Egypt,**

* We have heard about what he has done and how he helped you to escape from Egypt.
* We heard about everything he did in Egypt.

**For we have heard the reports about Him:** The clause *we have heard the reports about Him* indicates that the news about Yahweh had spread among the people in the surrounding area.

**all that He did in Egypt:** The clause *all that He did in Egypt* indicates that the Gibeonites heard about the miracles Yahweh did when he helped the Israelites escape from Egypt. These events are described in Exodus chapters 5–14\.

**and Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth:** *Og* was the name of the other Amorite king.

**Bashan:** *Bashan* was an area east and northeast of the Sea of Galilee. The Jordan River Valley forms its western boundary. Mount Hermon is its northern boundary, and the area of Gilead is the southern boundary. In modern times this is the Golan Heights.

Here are some other ways to translate this name:

> Bashan Country

> Bashan Region

**Ashtaroth:** The town of *Ashtaroth* was the capital town of Bashan, and was the town where King Og lived.9:10 Rasmussen, p. 227–228\.

### Section 9:1–27 The Gibeonites deceived the Israelites

The Gibeonite people lived near Ai. When they heard that Joshua had defeated Ai, they were afraid that he would conquer and kill them too. So, they sent messengers who pretended they had come from a long distance away. They deceived the Israelites and made a treaty of friendship with them.

Later, the Israelites learned that the Gibeonites lied to them, and that they lived quite close to them. They could not kill them because of the treaty, so they made them be water carriers and woodcutters for the Israelites.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The people of Gibeon

#### 9:11a

**So the elders and inhabitants of our land told us,**

* So our elders and all the people who live in our land told us,
* Our leaders and all our people told us

**So the elders:** The term *elders* refers to the leaders of the Gibeonites. Unlike the other towns in the region of Canaan, the Gibeonites were ruled by leaders but had no king.9:11 Woudstra, p. 159\.

**and inhabitants of our land told us:** The phrase *inhabitants of our land* refers to the people who lived in the region of the Gibeonites. Gibeon was actually a town, but it had power over the other nearby towns.

Here are some other ways to translate the term *land*:

> area

> region

#### 9:11b

**‘Take provisions for your journey;**

* ‘Take food for your journey
* to get some food ready for the journey

**Take provisions for your journey:** The clause *Take provisions for your journey* indicates that the people took food to eat. They put the food in sacks which their donkeys carried. They did not carry the food in their hands.

**for your journey:** The phrase *for your journey* refers to the trip that the Gibeonites took from their own town to the Israelite camp.

#### 9:11c

**go to meet them and say to them:**

* Travel to the Israelite camp and tell their leaders:
* and to come and meet you Israelites. They wanted us to tell you:

**go to meet them and say to them:** The clause *go to meet them* indicates that the Gibeonites should travel to the Israelite camp and introduce themselves to Joshua and the Israelites leaders.

##### **General Comment on 9:11a\-c**

The Gibeonites report this as a direct quote of what the elders told them to do. In some languages it may be more natural to translate this as an indirect quote. For example:

> Our leaders and all the people that live in our land told us to get some food ready for a trip and to go and meet you. (GNT)

#### 9:11d

**We are your servants. Please make a treaty with us.’**

* “We are willing to be your servants. Make a treaty with us.”
* “We acknowledge your authority. Please make a treaty with us.”

**We are your servants:** The clause *We are your servants* indicates that the Gibeonites were willing to become subject to the Israelites and submit to them. You should translate the phrase *your servants* in the same way as in 9:8a.

**Please:** The word *Please* is a way to make a polite request. You should use whatever word or grammatical means is appropriate to make a polite request in your language.

**make a treaty with us:** The clause *make a treaty with us* indicates that the Gibeonites wanted the Israelites to make a peace treaty with them.

**This bread of ours**

* Look at our bread.
* Do you see this bread?

**This bread of ours:** The Gibeonites said *This bread of ours* to call attention to the old bread they brought with them. In some languages it may be better to translate this as an imperative command, or as a rhetorical question. For example:

> Look, see what our bread is like!

> See this dry, crumbly bread of ours? (CEV)

#### 9:12b

**was warm when we packed it at home on the day we left to come to you.**

* On the day we left our houses to come to you it was still warm out of the oven.
* It was still warm from being cooked when we packed our food for the journey and left home.

**was warm when we packed it at home:** The clause *was warm* indicates that they had just finished baking the bread. It was warm because they took it out of the oven. If people are not familiar with making bread, it may be necessary to make this information explicit. For example:

> it was hot out of the oven on the day we packed the food when we left our homes (CEV)

> we had just baked this bread and it was still warm when we took it from our houses

**on the day we left to come to you:** The phrase *on the day we left to come to you* refers to the day that the Gibeonites started their trip to the Israelite camp.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> on the day we left our houses

The phrase *on the day we left to come to you* may be incorporated into the first verse part, as in CEV above. It may also be left as implicit information and not translated, as in NCV:

> Look at our bread. On the day we left home to come to you it was warm and fresh (NCV)

#### 9:12c

**But take a look, it is now dry and moldy.**

* But now it is dried out and hard.
* But now, look and see how dry and crumbly it is.

**But take a look:** The phrase *But take a look* calls attention to something important. It emphasizes that the journey was long because the bread is all dried up. Show this emphasis in a way that is natural in your language.

**it is now dry and moldy:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *moldy* is used only three times in the Old Testament. The meaning is uncertain. You should translate it the same way you did in 9:5b.

* When we put wine in these wineskins they were new. Now they are torn.
* These leather wine bags were new when we filled them with wine. But look, now they are split open.

**These wineskins were new when we filled them:** The term *wineskins* refers to the leather bags or pouches in which people carried their wine. Translate it the same way you did in 9:4\.

**but look:** The word *look* calls attention to something important and emphasizes it. Use whatever means is appropriate in your language to show importance or emphasis.

**they are cracked:** The clause *they are cracked* means that the wineskins were so old that there were cracks in the leather.

#### 9:13b

* Our clothes and our sandals are worn out from the very long trip.”
* Our clothes and our sandals are worn out because we came from so far away.”

**And these clothes:** The word *clothes* refers to the clothes the men were wearing.

**and sandals are worn out from our very long journey:** The phrase *worn out from our very long journey* emphasizes that the Gibeonites have come a long way and that they do not live near the Israelites.

**sandals:** The *sandals* that people wore in those times were open, with a sole under the foot and straps around the top. In some languages it may be more natural to call them:

**Then the men of Israel sampled their provisions,**

* ¶ The Israelites examined their things.
* ¶ So the Israelites looked at the food that the Gibeonites showed them and believed what they said.

**Then the men of Israel sampled their provisions:** The word *men* refers to the Israelite leaders. The term *their provisions* refers to the food that the Gibeonites brought with them.

**sampled their provisions:** There are three ways to interpret the meaning of the Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as *sampled their provisions*.

1. The Hebrew clause means that the Israelite leaders examined the food and accepted it as evidence that the Gibeonites had traveled from a distant place. For example:

    > the Israelites examined their food (NLT) *(NLT, NET, GW, NJPS)*

2. The Hebrew clause means that the Israelite leaders ate some of the food. For example:

    > the men of Israel sampled their provisions (NIV) *(BSB, NIV, RSV, GNT, CEV, NABRE, KJV)*

3. The Hebrew clause means that the Israelite leaders ate some of the food as part of a covenant ceremony. Some commentaries follow this interpretation, including the UBS Handbook, but no English version follows this interpretation.

It is recommended that you follow option (1\). This seems most likely in the context. The Gibeonites provided evidence, and the Israelites examined the evidence and believed it.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> the men believed the evidence they were shown (GW)

**sampled:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *sampled* is more literally “took.”

#### 9:14b

**but did not seek the counsel of the LORD.**

* And they did not ask Yahweh what he wanted them to do.
* But they did not ask for help from Yahweh.

**but did not seek the counsel of the LORD:** The clause *did not seek the counsel of the LORD* means that the Israelite leaders did not ask Yahweh to show them what to do. They decided what to do without listening to Yahweh.

This is an important point in the story. In the Hebrew text it is emphasized by a change of word order. Look for a natural way to emphasize it in your language. It might be clearer in some languages to translate this as an independent sentence with the subject made explicit: For example:

> But the Israelite leaders did not ask Yahweh what they should do.

#### 9:15a

**And Joshua made a treaty of peace with them to let them live,**

* And Joshua made a peace treaty with the Gibeonites. He made an agreement that they will not kill them.
* So Joshua made a treaty of friendship with the Gibeonites. He agreed to let them live.

**And:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *And* indicates the next action in the storyline. Indicate this in a natural way in your language.

**Joshua made a treaty of peace with them:** The Hebrew that the BSB and many English versions collapse into one clause, *Joshua made a treaty of peace with them*, is literally two clauses, “Joshua made peace with them, and he made a covenant for them.” Making a covenant, or a treaty, showed that there will be peace between the two groups of people. For example:

> So Joshua made peace with them by making a treaty (GW)

**to let them live:** The terms of the peace treaty allowed the Gibeonites to live as subjects, under the rule of the Israelites. The Israelites promised not to kill the Gibeonites as they did the other inhabitants of Canaan.

#### 9:15b

**and the leaders of the congregation swore an oath to them.**

* And Israel’s leaders swore that Israel will do according to the treaty.
* And the leaders of the Israelites promised to keep this treaty.

**and the leaders of the congregation swore an oath to them:** The phrase *the leaders of the congregation* refers to the leaders of the whole Israelite community.

**congregation:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *congregation* refers to a meeting of free Israelite men who were eligible for military service.9:15 Boling and Wright, p. 268\.

Here are some other ways to translate this word:

> the leaders of the assembly (NIV)

> the leaders of the community (NET, NABRE)

Some English versions leave this word implicit. For example:

> the Israelite leaders (NLT)

> their leaders (GNT)

**swore an oath to them:** The clause *swore an oath to them* means that the Israelite leaders swore an oath, or made a solemn promise, that they will keep the agreement that they made with the Gibeonites.

**Three days after they had made the treaty with the Gibeonites,**

* ¶ Three days after they made a treaty with the Gibeonites,
* ¶ On the third day after they made the peace agreement,

**Three days:** In Hebrew, part of a day was counted as one day when reckoning time. For example, if the treaty was made on a Monday, these events were probably on the Wednesday evening. Translate this reference to *Three days* in a natural way in your language.

**after they had made the treaty with the Gibeonites:** It may be necessary in some languages to make the subject and the object explicit, For example, you could say:

> three days after the Israelites made a covenant with the Gibeonites

#### 9:16b

**the Israelites learned that they were neighbors, living among them.**

* the Israelites learned that the Gibeonites lived nearby; that they were neighbors.
* they found out that the Gibeonites lived near them, not far from them.

**the Israelites learned that they were neighbors:** This indicates that the Israelites heard that the Gibeonites were their neighbors. In some languages it may be clearer to make either the subject or the object explicit. For example:

> the Israelites learned that these people did indeed live nearby (GNT)

> the Israelites learned that the Gibeonites lived nearby (NCV)

**living among them:** The clause *living among them* is another way to say that the Gibeonites lived in a nearby town. It emphasizes that the Gibeonites lived close by, not far away, as they had claimed. Use whatever lexical or grammatical means is natural to show this emphasis.

* So the Israelites went to see them, and on the third day they got to their cities.
* Then the Israelites walked to where the Gibeonites lived, and reached their cities in three days.

**So:** The Hebrew connector that the BSB translates as *So* introduces the next event in the narrative.

**the Israelites set out:** The clause *the Israelites set out* indicates that the Israelites left their camp to walk to where the Gibeonites lived and to confront them.

**and on the third day:** In Hebrew, part of a day was counted as one day when reckoning time. For example, if they started to walk on a Thursday, then they probably arrived on a Saturday. Translate this time reference in a natural way in your language.

**arrived at their cities:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *arrived at* means “reached.”

**their cities:** The Gibeonites lived in a group of at least four towns. These towns are named in the next part of this verse.

#### 9:17b

**But the Israelites did not attack them,**

* But the Israelites did not attack them
* But the people of Israel did not attack them,

**But:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *But* indicates contrast. Contrary to what one would expect, the Israelites did not attack these enemies.

**the Israelites did not attack them:** The term *the Israelites* refers to the people of Israel who went to visit the Gibeonites.

**attack:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *attack* can be translated in two different ways.

1. It is translated “did not attack them.” For example:

    > the people of Israel did not attack them (ESV) *(BSB, ESV, NIV, NRSV, NASB, NCV, NET, NJB, NAB, NJPS, NLT, REB, CEV, KJV)*

2. It is translated “did not kill them.” For example:

    > the Israelites could not kill them (GNT) *(GNT, RSV, GW)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\). This is the more accurate way to translate the Hebrew word. However, option (2\) is may be used if you consider this to be implied information. If the Israelites “attacked” the Gibeonites, then they would probably kill them.

#### 9:18b

* because the leaders of the community swore to a treaty of friendship with them in the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
* because the leaders of their assembly made a solemn promise in the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel to spare the Gibeonites.

**because the leaders of the congregation:** The word *congregation* refers to a meeting of free Israelite men who were eligible for military service. You should translate this the same way you did in 9:15\.

**had sworn an oath to them by the LORD, the God of Israel:** The clause *sworn an oath to them by the LORD, the God of Israel* indicates that the leaders made a promise to the Gibeonites in the name of Yahweh. The full name of God is used to emphasize the solemnity of this vow.

#### 9:18c

**And the whole congregation grumbled against the leaders.**

#### 9:19c

**and now we cannot touch them.**

* Now we cannot harm them.
* so now we can not attack them.

**and now we cannot touch them:** The clause *we cannot touch them* indicates that the Israelites could not attack the Gibeonites or harm them. This was because they made a vow to them in the name of Yahweh and this vow was binding.

**They continued, “Let them live,**

* The leaders repeated: “We must let them live.”
* So we must let them live.”

**They continued:** Verse 21 continues the answer that the Israelite leaders gave to those who wanted to attack the Gibeonites. The clause *They continued* may not be necessary in some languages. It may not be natural to repeat a quote margin in the middle of continuous speech. For example, the NLT deletes the quote margin:

> Let them live. (NLT)

The ESV follows the Hebrew with a long form of the quote margin:

> And the leaders said to them, “Let them live” (ESV)

**Let them live:** The clause *Let them live* indicates that the Israelites will not kill the Gibeonites.

The words *Let them live* are a repetition of what the leaders said in 20a. In some languages it may be clearer to use the word “repeated” in the quote margin. For example:

> They repeated, “Let them live”

#### 9:21b

**but let them be woodcutters and water carriers for the whole congregation.”**

* So they became servants for the whole community and cut the firewood and drew water from the wells,
* And so the Gibeonites cut firewood and drew water from the wells for all the Israel people.

**but let them be woodcutters and water carriers for the whole congregation:** There are two ways to interpret the use of this phrase:

1. These words are not part of the quotation that started in 21a. Instead, this phrase shows the result of the Israelites’ decision. For example:

    > 21a“Let them live.” 21bSo they became woodcutters and water carriers for the whole community. (NET) *(NET, RSV, ESV, NJPS, NLT, NASB)*

2. These words are part of the quotation that started in 21a. For example:

    > 21a“Let them live, 21bbut let them be woodcutters and water carriers for the entire community.” (NIV) *(BSB, NIV, NABRE, GNT, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\). This is followed by several English versions and several commentaries.

**woodcutters:** The word *woodcutters* indicates that the Gibeonites cut firewood for the Israelites.

**water carriers:** The phrase *water carriers* indicates that the Gibeonites drew water from the wells and carried it for the Israelites.

**the whole congregation:** The phrase *the whole congregation* indicates that the Gibeonites performed these tasks for the whole Israelite community, including the leaders and their families.

#### 9:21c

**So the leaders kept their promise.**

* which was what the leaders decided.
* This is what the Israelite leaders said they should do.

**So the leaders kept their promise:** The clause *So the leaders kept their promise* emphasizes the decision of the leaders about the Gibeonites. It was the leaders who made the decisions.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> So they became hewers of wood and drawers of water for all the congregation, as the leaders had decided concerning them (NRSV)

> So they made them woodcutters and water carriers for the entire community, as the Israelite leaders directed (NLT)

Use a way that is natural in your language to emphasize this decision of the leaders.

## Joshua 9:22 (id: 516217)

### Section 9:1–27 The Gibeonites deceived the Israelites

The Gibeonite people lived near Ai. When they heard that Joshua had defeated Ai, they were afraid that he would conquer and kill them too. So, they sent messengers who pretended they had come from a long distance away. They deceived the Israelites and made a treaty of friendship with them.

Later, the Israelites learned that the Gibeonites lied to them, and that they lived quite close to them. They could not kill them because of the treaty, so they made them be water carriers and woodcutters for the Israelites.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> The people of Gibeon

> The Gibeon people tricked the Israelites and made a treaty with them

#### 9:22a

**Then Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and said,**

* ¶ Joshua sent for the Gibeonite leaders and asked them:
* ¶ Joshua called together the Gibeonite leaders and said:

**Then Joshua summoned the Gibeonites:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *summoned* indicates that Joshua ordered the Gibeonites to come see him. He wanted to tell them how the Israelites would respond to their trickery.

**the Gibeonites:** The phrase *the Gibeonites* refers to the leaders or representatives of the Gibeonites, not to the whole group of Gibeonites.

**and said:** Some English versions translate the word *said* as “asked” because it introduces a rhetorical question. For example:

> Joshua ordered the people of Gibeon to be brought to him, and he asked them (GNT)

#### 9:22b

**“Why did you deceive us by telling us**

* “Why did you lie to us when you said,
* “You lied to us. You told us

**Why did you deceive us by telling us:** This is the beginning of a rhetorical question. It functions as a strong statement that the Gibeonites should not have tricked the Israelites.

Here are two ways to translate this statement:

* Use a rhetorical question. For example:

    > Why did you trick us? (NET)

* Use a strong statement. For example:

    > you should not have deceived us

    > you lied to us

Translate this strong statement in a way that is natural in your language.

#### 9:22c

**you live far away from us, when in fact you live among us?**

* ‘We live far away,’ but actually you live very close by.
* that you live far away, but actually you live nearby.

**you live far away from us:** The clause *you live far away from us* is Joshua’s paraphrase of what the Gibeonites told the Israelites.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> We live in a far country

**when in fact you live among us:** The clause *when…you live among us* indicates that the Gibeonites lived nearby.

##### **General Comment on 22b\-c**

Some other ways to translate the statements in 22b\-c are:

> You actually live close to us. Why did you lie and tell us that you live far away?

> You lied to us and said that you live far away. But actually you live nearby.

> Why did you deceive us and tell us that you were from far away, when you live right here? (GNT)

#### 9:23a\-b

**Now therefore you are under a curse and will perpetually serve as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Now therefore* can be translated in two different ways:

1. It means therefore, or because of this, or for that reason. For example:

    > Because you did this, God has condemned you. (GNT) *(BSB, GNT, RSV, ESV, NAB, NASB, NJPS, KJV)*

2. It is a temporal marker now. For example:

    > You are now under a curse (NIV) *(NIV, NABRE, GW, NCV, NET, NJB, REB, CEV)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\) and make the reason relation explicit. But option (2\) is acceptable if the reason relation is implied by the context in your translation.

**will perpetually serve as woodcutters and water carriers:** The Hebrew words are more literally “not he will be cut off from you a slave.” There are two ways to interpret what this means.

1. This means that all the Gibeonites became slaves. For example:

    > every one of you shall always be a slave (NABRE) *(BSB, NABRE, NASB, NIV, NET, GNT, GW, NAB, NCV, NJB, NJPS, NLT, KJV)*

2. This means that some of the Gibeonites became slaves. For example:

    > some of you shall never be anything by servants (ESV) *(ESV, RSV, REB, CEV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). God’s curse was on the whole Gibeonite nation. It is not clear from the Hebrew that we can translate this as only “some” of the Gibeonites.

#### 9:23a

**Now therefore you are under a curse and will perpetually serve**

* Because you did this there is a curse on you. You will always be our slaves.
* Therefore, God has condemned you. For all time you will be slaves.

**you are under a curse:** The phrase *you are under a curse* means that God considered them to be guilty and condemned them.

**will perpetually serve:** The phrase *will perpetually serve* indicates the Gibeonites will live in submission to the Israelites.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> shall always be slaves (RSV)

> shall never be anything but servants (ESV)

> perpetual servitude (NET)

#### 9:23b

**as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God.”**

* You will cut firewood and draw water for the house of my God.”
* You will have to cut wood and draw water from the wells for the tabernacle of my God.”

**woodcutters:** The word *woodcutters* indicates that they will cut firewood.

**and water carriers:** The phrase *water carriers* indicates that they will draw water from the wells and carry it.

**for the house of my God:** The phrase *for the house of my God* indicates that the Gibeonites will provide wood and water for the place of worship. During the time of Joshua, the *house of my God* in which the Israelites worshiped was a tent, not a permanent house. In 9:27 it is clear that the Gibeonites served both the place of worship and also the broader community in this way.

**my God:** The word *my* refers to Joshua. Joshua referred to Yahweh as his God.

#### 9:24a

**The Gibeonites answered,**

* ¶ The Gibeonites answered Joshua:
* ¶ The Gibeonites leaders replied to Joshua:

**The Gibeonites answered:** The phrase *The Gibeonites* refers to the Gibeonite leaders who met with Joshua. It may be necessary to make this clear in your translation.

#### 9:24b

**“Your servants were told clearly**

* “We did it because people told us for sure
* “We lied to you because they told us how certain is it

**Your servants were told clearly:** The phrase *were told* is passive. In some languages it may be clearer to make this an active phrase.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> we learned (GNT)

> We heard (NCV)

> people told us

**Your servants:** The Gibeonites called themselves *Your servants* to show respect to Joshua. Many languages have pronouns or other vocabulary for showing respect. Use whatever means is natural to indicate this.

**were told clearly:** The phrase *told clearly* translates an emphatic form of the Hebrew verb “told.” The Gibeonites emphasized that they heard a sure and certain report that the God of the Israelites was powerful. Use whatever means is natural to show that there is no doubt that the Gibeonites heard these things.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> your servants were clearly told (NIV)

> we learned that it was really true (GNT)

#### 9:24c

**that the LORD your God had commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land**

* that Yahweh your God commanded his servant Moses to give you all of this land.
* that Yahweh your God told his servant Moses to help you conquer this land.

**that the LORD your God had commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land:** It may be more natural to divided this long clause into two or more clauses. For example:

> we heard that Yahweh your God had made a promise to his servant Moses. Yahweh promised Moses that he would help the Israelites conquer this land

> we heard about the promise that Yahweh your God gave to Moses, who served him. Yahweh told Moses that the Israelites would take this land

#### 9:24d

**and wipe out all its inhabitants before you.**

* Yahweh promised Moses that he will help the Israelites kill all the people as you move into the land.
* We heard that you will kill all the people in the land.

**and wipe out all its inhabitants:** It may be more natural in some languages to begin a new sentence. For example:

> We heard that they will kill all the people who live in the land

**before you:** The phrase *before you* indicates that the Israelites will advance into the land, and kill the people living there wherever they find them.

#### 9:24e

**So we greatly feared for our lives because of you, and that is why we have done this.**

* We were afraid that you will kill us, and so we lied to you.
* This is why we tricked you into making a peace treaty. We were afraid you will kill us.

**So we greatly feared for our lives because of you:** The clause *we greatly feared for our lives* indicates that the Gibeonites were afraid the Israelites would kill them.

**and that is why we have done this:** The word *this* refers to the lie that the Gibeonites told the Israelites.

##### **General Comment on 9:24**

It may be more natural in some languages to rearrange the parts of this verse of the Gibeonites’ answer to Joshua.9:24 Bratcher and Newman, p. 134\. For example:

> 24aThey answered, 24e“We did it, sir, 24bbecause we learned that it was really true 24cthat the Lord your God had commanded his servant Moses to give you the whole land 24dand to kill the people living in it as you advanced. 24eWe did it because we were terrified of you; we were in fear of our lives.

**Now we are in your hands.**

* We know that you are more powerful than we are.
* Now look, you have the strength to do anything you want.

**Now:** The word *Now* calls attention to what the Gibeonites said next. It is a way to emphasize it. Use whatever means is natural to show this emphasis.

**we are in your hands:** The clause *we are in your hands* is an idiom. It indicates that the Gibeonites know the Israelites are stronger than them and can do whatever they want to them.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> we are in your power (NET)

> you are strong enough to do anything to us that you want (CEV)

#### 9:25b

* So treat us in whatever way seems just to you.”
* Do to us whatever you think is right.”

**Do to us whatever seems good and right to you:** The phrase *Do to us whatever seems good and right to you* indicates that the Gibeonites asked the Israelites to treat them in whatever way seemed just to the Israelites.

* ¶ So Joshua saved them from the Israelites,
* ¶ So Joshua rescued the Gibeonites from them

**So Joshua did this and delivered them:** The two clauses *Joshua did this and delivered them* indicate that Joshua decided to save the lives of the Gibeonites. These clauses can be combined as one clause, for example,

> So Joshua saved them from the Israelites. (NIV)

> So Joshua rescued them (GW)

**from the hands of the Israelites:** The phrase *from the hands of the Israelites* indicates that Joshua did not allow the Israelites to kill the Gibeonites.

#### 9:26b

**and they did not kill the Gibeonites.**

* and they did not kill them.
* and the Israelites did not kill them.

**and they did not kill the Gibeonites:** The clause *they did not kill the Gibeonites* states the same meaning as 26a in different words. Joshua kept the Israelites from killing the Gibeonites, and the Israelites did not kill them.

#### 9:27a

**On that day he made them woodcutters and water carriers,**

* But from that day on he made the Gibeonites cut firewood and draw water.
* But starting from that day, Joshua made the Gibeonites be woodcutters and water carriers,

**On that day he made them woodcutters and water carriers:** This indicates that Joshua carried out the decision of the leaders that was mentioned in 9:21\. The Gibeonites will live among the Israelites and will cut firewood and draw water from the wells for them.

**On that day:** Here is another way to translate the words *that day*:

> starting from that day

> from that day on

#### 9:27b

**as they are to this day**

* They are still doing it today
* and they continue to this day.

**as they are to this day:** The phrase *as they are to this day* indicates that when the book of Joshua was written, the Gibeonites were still slaves who cut wood and drew water.

#### 9:27c

**for the congregation of the LORD and for the altar**

* for the community and for the altar of Yahweh,
* They provided for the Israelites, and for the altar of Yahweh,

**for the congregation of the LORD and for the altar:** The phrase *for the congregation of the LORD and for the altar* indicates that the Gibeonites will supply wood and water for the Israelite community and for the special needs of the altar.

**altar:** The word *altar* is used in place of the phrase “house of my God” in 9:23b. Both the word *altar* and the phrase “house of my God” refer to the same place. This was the tent of worship where the priests burned sacrifices to Yahweh.

#### 9:27d

**at the place He would choose.**

* in whatever place Yahweh decides the altar should be.
* They serve the altar wherever Yahweh decides the altar should be.

**at the place He would choose:** This indicates that in the future Yahweh may choose a different place for the altar. The Gibeonites will continue to provide wood and water wherever it might be.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> wherever the Lord would choose to build it (NLT)

> wherever he chose it to be (NCV)

##### **General Comment on 9:27c\-d**

It may be more natural in some languages to reorder 27b\-d so that the phrase “at the place He would choose” is next to the phrase “for the altar.” For example:

### Section 10:1–27 Five Canaanite Kings attacked the Israelites

The kings of five Canaanite towns joined together to fight against Gibeon. Because the Israelites had a peace treaty with Gibeon, they helped them in their fight. Yahweh helped the Israelites by sending down hailstones on the Canaanites, and by causing the sun to stop moving so that the Israelites could continue their victory. The five Canaanite kings were captured and put to death.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Israel defeated the Canaan group

> The sun stood still

#### 10:1a

**Now Adoni\-zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured Ai**

* ¶ Adoni\-Zedek, the king of Jerusalem, heard that Joshua captured Ai
* ¶ At this time King Adoni\-Zedek of Jerusalem City heard that Joshua defeated

**Now:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Now* introduces a series of dependent clauses in 1a\-e.

**Adoni\-zedek king of Jerusalem heard:** In 9:1–2 the kings who ruled on the west side of the Jordan River *heard* about Joshua and the amazing things that Yahweh had done for the Israelites. In 10:1 the kings who ruled in Southern Canaan *heard* similar news. The word *heard* at the beginning of chapters 9, 10, and 11 gives a thematic unity to these chapters. It is recommended that you translate the word *heard* at the beginning of each of these chapters in a way that keeps this thematic unity but is also natural in your language.

**Adoni\-zedek:** The name *Adoni\-zedek* means “My master is righteous” in Hebrew. Some English versions hyphenate this name and other versions write it as one word. For example:

> Adonizedek (GNT)

**Jerusalem:** At this time *Jerusalem* was a Canaanite town. The people of Israel did not yet live there.

**that Joshua had captured Ai:** The clause *Joshua had captured Ai* indicates that Joshua and his army captured the town of Ai, and defeated it.

#### 10:1b

**and devoted it to destruction—**

* and destroyed it completely,
* and completely destroyed Ai City.

**and devoted it to destruction:** The phrase *devoted it to destruction* indicates that Joshua and his army completely destroyed the town and everything in it. There was nothing left but rubble.

#### 10:1c

**doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king—**

* and killed its king, as he destroyed Jericho and killed its king.
* He destroyed it and killed its king, as he destroyed Jericho City and killed its king.

**doing to Ai and its king:** The clause *doing to Ai and its king* means that Joshua and his army killed the people who lived in the town of Ai and also killed the king of Ai.

**as he had done to Jericho and its king:** The clause *as he had done to Jericho* means that Joshua treated these two towns in the same way. He killed the people of Jericho along with their king, and he also killed the people who lived in Ai and their king.

#### 10:1d

**and that the people of Gibeon had made peace with Israel**

* He heard that the Gibeonites made peace with Israel
* He also heard that the people of Gibeon City made a treaty with Israel

**and that the people of Gibeon:** The phrase *the people of Gibeon* refers to the people who lived in the towns of Gibeon.

**had made peace with Israel:** The clause *made peace with Israel* refers to the peace treaty that the Gibeonite leaders made with the Israelite leaders.

#### 10:1e

**and were living near them.**

* and lived with them.
* and that they lived among them.

**and were living near them:** The clause *were living near them* indicates that the Gibeonites lived in the same area as the Israelites.

##### **General Comment on 10:1a\-e**

This sentence in the BSB is long and complex. The main verb of the sentence does not come until verse 2\. Verse 1 consists of background information. The first action in the story is in verse 2\. It may be clearer in some languages to translate verse 1 as two or three independent sentences. For example:

> 1aAdoni\-zedek, king of Jerusalem, heard that Joshua had captured 1band completely destroyed Ai 1cand killed its king just as he had destroyed the town of Jericho and killed its king. 1dHe also learned that the Gibeonites had made peace with Israel 1eand were now their allies. (NLT)

**So Adoni\-zedek and his people were greatly alarmed,**

* King Adoni\-Zedek and his people were very afraid when they heard this,
* When he and his people heard this they were frightened.

**So Adoni\-zedek and his people were greatly alarmed:** The words *greatly alarmed* refer to King Adoni\-zedek. They indicate that the king was very afraid.

There is a textual issue here.

1. The Hebrew Masoretic text and the Septuagint translation into Greek both read “they feared greatly.” For example:

    > he and his people were very much alarmed (NIV) *(BSB, NIV, NET, NABRE, GW, NCV, NLT, GNT, CEV, KJV)*

2. Some ancient translations such as the Syriac read “he feared greatly.” For example:

    > he feared greatly (ESV) *(ESV, RSV, NASB, NJPS, REB)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\). Usually we translate the Hebrew text unless it is very difficult. Your translation could say “they” or it could say “the king and his people.” Here is another way to translate this:

> the people of Jerusalem were greatly alarmed (GNT)

If you have translated 10:1 as an independent sentence, you may need to supply some implicit information here. For example, the NLT supplies this information:

> He and his people became very afraid when they heard all this (NLT)

#### 10:2b

**because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities;**

* because Gibeon was an important city, like the cities that had a king,
* They knew that Gibeon was a big city, as big as the cities that had kings.

**because:** The word *because* introduces the reason why the king and his people were afraid.

**Gibeon was a great city:** In 9:17 it said that Gibeon was actually a group of four towns. The phrase *a great city* indicates that Gibeon was a large and important place.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> a large city (NET)

> an important city (NIV)

**like one of the royal cities:** The phrase *like one of the royal cities* indicates that Gibeon was equal in size and importance to the towns that had a king to rule them. Gibeon was ruled by an assembly of leaders and did not have a king.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> as large as any of the cities that had a king (GNT)

#### 10:2c

**it was larger than Ai, and all its men were mighty.**

* and because it was larger than Ai, and the men of Gibeon were good fighters.
* It was larger than Ai, and all its men were soldiers.

**and all its men were mighty:** The clause *all its men were mighty* indicates that all the men of Ai were good at fighting.

**“Come up and help me. We will attack Gibeon,**

* “Come to me and help me attack Gibeon,
* “Come with me. Let’s attack Gibeon,

**Come up and help me:** The two clauses *Come up and help me* indicate that the king of Jerusalem asked these four kings to join with him in battle against the Gibeonites. The word *Come* *up* is used because Jerusalem was at a higher elevation than the other four towns. In languages that do not keep track of elevation, it may be more natural to say “come to me.”

**We will attack Gibeon:** The clause *We will attack Gibeon* indicates that the king of Jerusalem asked the other four kings to gather their armies together with his and attack the people of Gibeon.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> Come and help me attack Gibeon (GNT)

#### 10:4b

**because they have made peace with Joshua and the Israelites.”**

* for they have made a peace treaty with Joshua and the Israelites.”
* because the people of Gibeon have made peace with Joshua and the people of Israel.”

**because they have made peace with Joshua and the Israelites:** The clause *they have made peace* states the reason the king of Jerusalem wanted to attack the town of Gibeon. The Gibeonites had a treaty with the Israelites.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> because its people have made peace with Joshua and the Israelites (GNT)

##### **General Comment on 10:4a\-b**

It may be more natural in some languages to change the order of 4a and 4b, and state the reason first, as in CEV:

> 4bThe Gibeonites have made a peace treaty with Joshua and the Israelites. 4aCome and help me attack Gibeon! (CEV)

### Section 10:1–27 Five Canaanite Kings attacked the Israelites

The kings of five Canaanite towns joined together to fight against Gibeon. Because the Israelites had a peace treaty with Gibeon, they helped them in their fight. Yahweh helped the Israelites by sending down hailstones on the Canaanites, and by causing the sun to stop moving so that the Israelites could continue their victory. The five Canaanite kings were captured and put to death.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Israel defeated the Canaan group

> The sun stood still

#### 10:5a

**So the five kings of the Amorites—**

* Then these five Amorite kings,
* So these five kings of the Amorites,

**So the five kings of the Amorites:** The phrase *the five kings of the Amorites* refers to the kings who were mentioned in verse 3\. These kings were all “Amorite” kings. The term “Amorite” referred to people who lived in the hill country. These five kings lived in the southwestern hill country. The towns of the Gibeonites were north of Jerusalem. These kings wanted to attack Gibeon because they had trade connections with it.10:5 Hess, p. 190\. The peace treaty that the Gibeonites made with the Israelites made it difficult to trade with them.

#### 10:5b

**the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon—**

* the king of Jerusalem City, the king of Hebron City, the king of Jarmuth City, the king of Lachish City, and the king of Eglon City,
* the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon

**the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon:** This list of kings is repeated from verse 3\. In some languages it may be more natural to avoid some of the repetition.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> Then the five kings of the Amorites—the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon (NIV)

> When these five Amorite kings (CEV)

#### 10:5c

**joined forces and advanced with all their armies.**

* gathered their armies, and they all went up
* got their soldiers together. All five armies went up

**joined forces:** The clause *joined forces* indicates that the five kings assembled their armies together.

**and advanced with all their armies:** The clause *advanced with all their armies* indicates that the five kings led their armies and went to the towns of Gibeon.

**advanced:** The Hebrew text says they *advanced*. Although the towns of Gibeon were at about the same elevation as Jerusalem, they were higher than the other four towns. In languages that do not keep track of elevation, it may be more natural to say:

> they went with all their armies

#### 10:5d

**They camped before Gibeon and made war against it.**

* and surrounded Gibeon, and attacked it.
* to Gibeon, and surrounded it, and fought against it.

**They camped before Gibeon:** The clause *camped before Gibeon* indicates that the armies surrounded the town so that the Gibeonites could not leave it. They could not find food and would soon become weak. Then the five Amorite armies could conquer it.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> (they) surrounded Gibeon (GNT)

> (they) moved all their troops into place (NLT)

In 9:17 it says that the Gibeonites lived in four towns: Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth and Kiriath Jearim. Probably this attack was only against the town of Gibeon.

**and made war against it:** The clause *made war against it* indicates that the five armies attacked the towns of Gibeon.

### Paragraph 10:6–11

The Israelites defended the Gibeonites against their enemies.

#### 10:6a

**Then the men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal:**

* ¶ The Gibeonites sent messengers to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal.
* ¶ The leaders of the Gibeonites sent a message to Joshua in his camp at Gilgal.

**Then:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Then* introduces the next event in the storyline. Introduce this next event in a natural way in your language.

**the men of Gibeon:** The phrase *the men of Gibeon* refers to an indefinite number of people. Probably these men were some of the Gibeonite leaders.

**sent word to Joshua:** The clause *sent word to Joshua* indicates that the Gibeonites sent messengers to Joshua to ask him for his help.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> sent this message to Joshua (NET)

> sent messengers to Joshua (NLT)

**in the camp at Gilgal:** The phrase *the camp at Gilgal* refers to the same camping place where the Israelites were staying. Gilgal was where the Gibeonites first met with the Israelites (9:6\).

#### 10:6b

**“Do not abandon your servants.**

* They said: “Don’t abandon your servants.
* They pleaded with them: “We are your servants. Don’t throw us away.

In Hebrew this clause begins with the word translated literally as “saying.” It may be more natural in some languages to begin a new sentence here. In this case, the word “saying” may be translated as:

> They said

> They begged

> They pleaded

Use words that show the urgency of their request.

**Do not abandon your servants:** The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as *Do not abandon* is a Hebrew idiom. It could be more literally translated “do not let your hand drop.” This idiom indicates that the Gibeonites asked Joshua to protect them from the Amorite kings and their armies. They expected the Israelites to help them because of the peace treaty that they had made with them.

**your servants:** The phrase *your servants* is used by the Gibeonites to show their respect for Joshua and the Israelites. Many languages have pronouns or nouns that are used when speaking to superiors. Use whatever is most natural in your language to express this relationship.

#### 10:6c

**Come quickly and save us! Help us,**

* Come quickly. Save us. Help us.
* Come now. We desperately need your help.

**Come:** In Hebrew, the word *Come* is more literally “come up". The town of Gibeon was higher than the Israelites’ camp at Gilgal. If your language keeps track of elevation, this would be a place to imply going up a steep hill/mountain.

**quickly:** The word *quickly* indicates the urgency of the Gibeonites’ request. They are in danger and want Joshua and the Israelite army to come at once to fight with them against the Amorite armies.

**and save us! Help us:** The two verbs *save* and *Help* are very similar in meaning. The Hebrew text uses two verbs with similar meanings to emphasize the urgency of the request. It may be more natural in some languages to express this meaning using one verb and some other means of showing emphasis.

#### 10:6d

**because all the kings of the Amorites from the hill country have joined forces against us.”**

* For all the Amorite kings who live in the hill country are attacking us.”
* The kings of all the Amorite cities in the mountains have gotten together to attack us.”

**because:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *because* introduces the reason for the Gibeonites’ request.

**all the kings of the Amorites from the hill country:** The Gibeonites referred to the five kings that are mentioned in 10:3\. There may also have been other kings of smaller towns in the hill country, as 10:28–39 suggests. In addition, the Gibeonites may have exaggerated the facts because they were afraid.10:6 Hess, p. 192\.

**have joined forces against us:** The clause *joined forces against us* indicates that the Amorite kings with their armies were preparing to attack the Gibeonites.

#### 10:7a

**So Joshua and his whole army,**

* So Joshua with all his soldiers,
* So Joshua and his entire army,

**Joshua and his whole army:** The phrase *his whole army* refers the Israelite soldiers. These soldiers went with Joshua to fight against the Amorites.

#### 10:7b

**including all the mighty men of valor,**

* including those who were strongest and bravest,
* including his best warriors,

**all the mighty men of valor:** The phrase *mighty men of valor* refers to the strongest and bravest soldiers in the Israelite army.

Here are some other way to translate this phrase:

> including the bravest warriors (NET)

> including all the best fighting men (NIV)

#### 10:7c

**came from Gilgal.**

* went from Gilgal.
* left Gilgal to go to Gibeon.

**came from Gilgal:** The clause *came from Gilgal* indicates that when Joshua received the message from the Gibeonites, he left the Israelite camp at Gilgal to help the Gibeonites fight against the Amorites. Here, as in 10:6c, the Hebrew word indicates elevation, that the army went up a steep hill/mountain since Gibeon was a higher elevation than Gilgal.

##### **General Comment on 10:7**

It may be more natural in some languages to include the whole subject (Joshua and his army) at the beginning of the verse followed by the verb, like the BSB does.

The Hebrew text mentions Joshua first as a way to show the importance of Joshua as the leader. Use a way that is natural in your language to emphasize Joshua’s importance. For an example of the Hebrew word order, the RSV says:

> Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor (RSV)

#### 10:8a

**The LORD said to Joshua,**

* Yahweh said to Joshua:
* Yahweh told Joshua:

The Hebrew word that the BSB leaves untranslated but many English versions translate as “and” indicates that the next action in the story is taking place. Use whatever connecting word is natural in your language to express this.

#### 10:8b

**“Do not be afraid of them, for I have delivered them into your hand.**

* “Don’t be afraid of them. I will give you power to defeat them.
* “Don’t be afraid of the Amorites. They will lose when you attack them.

**Do not be afraid of them:** The pronoun *them* refers to the Amorite kings and their armies. It may be necessary to make this explicit in some languages. For example:

> don’t be afraid of the Amorites (CEV)

**for I have delivered them into your hand:** The clause *I have delivered them into your hand* states the reason that the Israelites did not need to be afraid of the Amorite armies. The clause *delivered them into your hand* is a Hebrew idiom. It indicates that Yahweh will enable the Israelites to defeat the Amorites. The words Yahweh spoke to Joshua are similar to the encouraging words he said to Joshua in 1:2,5,9\.

Here are some other ways to translate this idiom:

> I have given you victory over them (NLT)

> they will run away when you attack (CEV)

#### 10:8c

**Not one of them shall stand against you.”**

* Not one of them will be able to defeat you.”
* None of them will be able to fight against you.”

**Not one of them shall stand against you:** The clause *Not one of them shall stand against you* is a Hebrew idiom. It indicates that the Amorites will not be able to defeat the Israelites. All the Amorites will die or will run away. This happened in 10:10–11\.

Here are some other ways to translate this idiom:

> not one of them can resist you (NET)

> none of them will be able to fight and defeat you

#### 10:9a

**After marching all night from Gilgal,**

* After they walked uphill from Gilgal to Gibeon during the night,
* They did this by walking all night from their camp at Gilgal.

**After marching all night from Gilgal:** The clause *marching all night from Gilgal* indicates that it took all night for Joshua and the Israelite army to walk uphill from Gilgal to Gibeon. The distance from Gilgal to Gibeon was about twenty to twenty\-five miles up a fairly steep hill.10:9 Howard, p. 236, note 186\.

**marching:** The English verb *marching* is used for soldiers who are walking.

#### 10:9b

**Joshua caught them by surprise.**

* Joshua and the Israelite army made a surprise attack on the Amorites,
* And Joshua attacked the Amorites when they were not expecting it.

**Joshua caught them by surprise:** Joshua was the leader of the Israelites, and he attacked the Amorites along with his army. The word *them* refers to the Amorites.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> Joshua and the Israelite army made a surprise attack upon the Amorite armies.

**caught them by surprise:** The phrase *caught them by surprise* is a Hebrew idiom. It indicates that the Amorites did not know that the Israelites were going to attack them. It was a surprise.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> attacked them by surprise (NET)

> attacked them when they were not expecting it

##### **General Comment on 10:9a\-b**

In some languages it may be more natural to reorder 9a and 9b so that the events are in the Hebrew sentence order. For example:

### Paragraph 10:6–11

The Israelites defended the Gibeonites against their enemies.

#### 10:10a

**And the LORD threw them into confusion before Israel,**

* Yahweh confused the Amorite armies when Israel attacked.
* Yahweh made the Amorites be afraid when they saw the Israelites.

**And the LORD threw them into confusion before Israel:** The clause *threw them into confusion* indicates that Yahweh caused the Amorite armies to be confused and afraid, so that they could not fight the Israelites.

#### 10:10b

**who defeated them in a great slaughter at Gibeon,**

* The Israelite army defeated them in a great victory at Gibeon.
* The Israelites killed many of them at Gibeon City.

**who defeated them in a great slaughter:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *defeated them in a great slaughter* is more literally “hit them with a great hit.” This Hebrew idiom means that the Israelite army killed many Amorite soldiers.

There is an interpretation issue in this clause. The verb *defeated* (or “hit”) is marked as masculine singular and there is no nominal subject. English versions interpret the subject of the verb in three ways:

1. The subject of the verb is the Israelite army. For example:

    > and the Israelites slaughtered great numbers of them at Gibeon (NLT) *(BSB, NIV, RSV, ESV, NET, NLT, NAB, GNT, NCV, CEV)*

2. The subject of the verb is Joshua. For example:

    > Joshua utterly defeated them at Gibeon (REB) *(REB, NEB, NJPS)*

3. The subject of the verb is Yahweh. For example:

    > and He struck them down with a great defeat at Gibeon (NASB) *(NASB, NJB, GW, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). Verses 8 and 11 make it clear that the Israelites defeated the Amorites only with Yahweh’s help, but verse 11 also makes it clear that the Israelites had a part in the defeat.

**at Gibeon:** The phrase *at Gibeon* refers to the town of Gibeon, where the battle took place.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> (Israel) defeated them with a great victory at Gibeon (NIV)

> Israel thoroughly defeated them at Gibeon (NET)

#### 10:10c

**pursued them along the ascent to Beth\-horon,**

* The Israelitte army chased them along the road going up to Beth\-horon,
* They chased them up to the mountain pass at Upper Beth\-horon City,

**pursued them along the ascent to Beth\-horon:** The phrase *along the ascent to Beth\-horon* indicates that the Israelite army pursued the Amorite armies uphill to Beth\-horon.

**Beth\-horon:** There were two towns named Beth\-horon. Upper Beth\-horon was 66 meters higher in altitude than Gibeon. Lower Beth\-horon is referred to in verse 11\. The road from Gibeon goes first uphill to Upper Beth\-horon, and then down to Lower Beth\-horon.10:10 Woudstra, p. 172, footnote 19\. Upper Beth\-horon was the highest town in that area. It dominated an important mountain pass that led to the lower hills and the plain to the west.10:10 Hess, p. 195\.

The English versions spell the name Beth\-horon in various ways:

> Beth\-horon (BSB, RSV, ESV, NLT, NABRE, NJPS, NASB, KJV)

> Beth Horon (NET, NIV, GNT, GW)

> Beth\-Horon (CEV)

#### 10:10d

**and struck them down as far as Azekah and Makkedah.**

* and killed more of them all the way to Azekah and Makkedah.
* kept on killing them going down to Azekah City and Makkedah City.

**and struck them down:** The Hebrew idiom that the BSB translates as *struck them down* is more literally “hit them.” This idiom indicates that the Israelite army killed many of the Amorite fighters.

**as far as Azekah and Makkedah:** The phrase *as far as Azekah and Makkedah* indicates that the Israelite army continued to pursue the Amorite armies all the way to the towns of Azekah and Makkedah. Azekah was about 30 kilometers south of Beth\-horon and is considerably lower downhill. Makkedah was in the southern part of Canaan, about 14 kilometers west of Hebron.10:10 Rasmussen, p. 244\.

#### 10:11a

**As they fled before Israel**

* While the Amorite armies ran away from the Israelites,
* The Amorites fled from the Israelites.

**As they fled before Israel:** This verse is a flashback. It provides additional information about what happened in 10:10\. The word *they* refers to the Amorite armies.

**fled before Israel:** The clause *fled before Israel* indicates that the Amorite armies turned and ran away from the Israelite army.

#### 10:11b

**along the descent from Beth\-horon**

* and while they were running down the mountain slope from Beth\-horon,
* They fled down the hill from Beth\-horon City.

**along the descent from Beth\-horon:** The phrase *the descent from Beth\-horon* indicates that the Amorite armies ran down from the mountain pass. Starting from Upper Beth\-horon, they ran southwest and down out of the hill country.

**the descent from Beth\-horon:** There is an interpretation issue with this phrase.

1. This means the descent of Beth\-horon, or the way down from Beth\-horon. For example:

    > on the road down from Beth Horon (NIV) *(BSB, NIV, NET, GNT, CEV, GW, NASB, NCV, NLT, NRSV, NJPS, REB)*

2. This mean the ascent of Beth\-horon. For example:

    > while they were going down the ascent of Beth\-horon (ESV) *(ESV, RSV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). The Hebrew text is clear and it is best to follow it. In verse 10 the Amorite army fled from the Israelites at Gibeon town and followed the road up the mountain slope to Beth\-horon town. This was at the peak of the pass through the mountains. In verse 11 the Amorite army then fled through the mountain pass and downhill to the foothills and plains below.

#### 10:11c

**to Azekah, the LORD cast down on them large hailstones from the sky,**

* Yahweh made large hailstones fall on them from the sky, all the way to Azekah, and so many of them died.
* Then Yahweh threw large hailstones on them from the sky on the road to Azekah. This killed many of them.

**to Azekah:** The phrase *to Azekah* indicates that the hail continued to fall on the Amorite armies all the way to Azekah. The distance that the Amorite armies ran away from the Israelites was about twenty miles.10:11 Howard, p. 237\.

**the LORD cast down on them large hailstones from the sky:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *large hailstones* refers to lumps of hail. Hail is ice that comes down from the sky. Hail storms occur about five to eight times per year in Palestine.10:11 Boling and Wright p. 282\.

**the sky:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *sky* can also be translated “heaven.” For example:

> the Lord threw down great stones from heaven upon them (RSV)

#### 10:11d

**and more of them were killed by the hailstones than by the swords of the Israelites.**

* The hailstones killed more of the Amorites than the Israelites killed with their swords.
* More of the Amorites were killed by hailstones than were killed by the Israelites.

**more of them were killed by the hailstones than by the swords of the Israelites:** Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> the hailstones killed more of the enemy soldiers than the Israelites killed with their swords

**more of them were killed:** The clause *more of them were killed* shows the result of the hailstorm. It may be clearer in some languages to make the connection between the hail and their death explicit. For example:

> because of that, they died

> and the hail killed them

**by the swords of the Israelites:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *by the swords* is an idiom. This is a Hebrew idiom. It means that they killed the people.

Here is another way to translate this Hebrew idiom:

> more were killed by the hailstones than by the Israelites (GNT)

### Section 10:1–27 Five Canaanite Kings attacked the Israelites

The kings of five Canaanite towns joined together to fight against Gibeon. Because the Israelites had a peace treaty with Gibeon, they helped them in their fight. Yahweh helped the Israelites by sending down hailstones on the Canaanites, and by causing the sun to stop moving so that the Israelites could continue their victory. The five Canaanite kings were captured and put to death.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Israel defeated the Canaan group

> The sun stood still

#### 10:12a

**On the day that the LORD gave the Amorites over to the Israelites,**

* On the same day that Yahweh helped the Israelites to defeat the Amorites,
* On the day that they defeated the Amorites with the help of Yahweh,

**On the day that the LORD gave the Amorites over to the Israelites:** This is the same day as the events referred to in 10:10–11\. In 10:12–15, the author told the story of the battle of Gibeon again from another perspective and added new information to what he had already said. It may be clearer in some languages to translate the clause *the day that the LORD gave the Amorites over to the Israelites* as an independent sentence. For example, you could say:

> Yahweh gave the Israelites victory over the Amorites on that day. On that same day Joshua spoke to Yahweh…

**the LORD gave the Amorites over to the Israelites:** The clause *the LORD gave the Amorites over to the Israelites* is a Hebrew idiom. It indicates that Yahweh helped the Israelites to defeat the Amorites. For example:

> the Lord gave the men of Israel victory over the Amorites (GNT)

#### 10:12b

**Joshua spoke to the LORD**

* ¶ Joshua spoke to Yahweh.
* ¶ Joshua prayed to Yahweh.

**Joshua spoke to the LORD:** Some English versions follow the Hebrew word order, “spoke Joshua to the LORD.” It puts the verb before the subject. The natural English word order is *Joshua spoke* as in the BSB. Translate this phrase in a way that is natural in your language.

**Joshua spoke:** In some languages it may be more natural to translate the word *spoke* as “prayed.” For example:

> on that same day Joshua prayed to Yahweh while the Israelites watched him

#### 10:12c

**in the presence of Israel:**

* Joshua prayed in front of the Israelites:
* Joshua prayed while Israel was watching, and he said:

**in the presence of Israel:** The phrase *in the presence of Israel* indicates that the Israelites who fought the battle watched while Joshua prayed to Yahweh.

#### 10:12d

**“O sun, stand still over Gibeon, O moon, over the Valley of Aijalon.”**

* “Sun, stop moving above Gibeon, and moon, stop moving above the valley of Aijalon.”
* “Let the sun stay in one place over Gibeon, and the moon stay in one place over the valley of Aijalon.”

**O sun, stand still over Gibeon:** The expression, *O sun, stand still over Gibeon* is a kind of figurative language called personification. Personification gives human characteristics to non\-human things for poetic effect. In 12b Joshua spoke to Yahweh. In 12d Joshua spoke to the *sun*. If the reader does not understand that this is figurative language, it is good to make this clear. One way to clarify this is to include some implicit information:

> Joshua asked Yahweh to make the sun and the moon stand still. He said, “Sun, stay still at Gibeon. And moon, stay still in the valley of Aijalon.”

**O sun, stand still:** The command *sun, stand still* may not be natural in some languages. The sun does not have legs and it may not be possible to say that the sun can *stand*.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> Sun, stop moving in the sky

> Sun, stay in one place

**over Gibeon:** It may be more natural to translate the phrase *over Gibeon* as “at Gibeon,” or “above Gibeon.” The sun shone in the sky over the town of Gibeon. Use a preposition that is natural in your language.

**O moon, over the Valley of Aijalon:** The expression *O moon, over the Valley of Aijalon* is an example of personification. Personification gives human characteristics to non\-human things for poetic effect.

**the Valley of Aijalon:** The phrase *Valley of Aijalon* refers to the valley where the town of Aijalon was, seven to ten miles west of Gibeon.10:12 Bratcher and Newman, p. 143\. The Amorites fled from Gibeon as far as Azekah (10:10d). Aijalon was between Gibeon and Azekah.

Here are some ways to translate 10:12c\-d:

> Joshua prayed to the Lord in front of all the people of Israel. He said, “Let the sun stand still over Gibeon, and the moon over the valley of Aijalon.” (NLT)

> In the presence of the people of Israel, Joshua said, “Yahweh, cause the sun to stop moving over Gibeon and cause the moon to stop moving over the valley of Aijalon.”

##### **General Comment on 10:12d**

In the ancient Near East many people believed that natural objects such as the sun and the moon had a soul or a spirit. The Bible does not teach this. Joshua did not actually speak to the sun or the moon, and he did not expect them to respond to his command. The language Joshua used is a figure of speech called “personification.” Personification gives human characteristics to non\-human things. It is used to add emotional impact to the story. As you translate this verse, keep in mind that this response by the sun and moon to Joshua’s command is poetic language. It should not be understood literally.

A miracle of God’s power took place when he lengthened the day. It was God, responding to the prayer of Joshua, who caused the miracle. The sun and moon did not actually do anything. God made them stand still.

Joshua spoke to both the sun and the moon. Biblical scholars do not agree on why he addressed both the sun and the moon. One possibility is that Joshua prayed this prayer in the early morning when the sun was rising in the east and the moon was setting in the west.

### Section 10:1–27 Five Canaanite Kings attacked the Israelites

The kings of five Canaanite towns joined together to fight against Gibeon. Because the Israelites had a peace treaty with Gibeon, they helped them in their fight. Yahweh helped the Israelites by sending down hailstones on the Canaanites, and by causing the sun to stop moving so that the Israelites could continue their victory. The five Canaanite kings were captured and put to death.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Israel defeated the Canaan group

> The sun stood still

#### 10:13a

**So the sun stood still and the moon stopped**

* Then the sun stood still and the moon did not move
* So the sun and the moon both stopped and remained in one place.

**So the sun stood still:** The clause *So the sun stood still* is a result clause. This was what happened as a result of Joshua’s prayer. Use whatever connecting word indicates a result in your language. The clause *the sun stood still* indicates that the sun remained in the same place in the sky. God answered Joshua’s prayer and caused the sun to stay still.

**and the moon stopped:** The clause *and the moon stopped* indicates that the moon remained in one place in the sky, because Joshua prayed for this to happen. God answered Joshua’s prayer and caused the moon to stay still.

#### 10:13b

**until the nation took vengeance upon its enemies.**

* until the Israelites completely defeated their enemies.
* They stayed there until Israel finished fighting its enemies.

**until the nation took vengeance upon its enemies:** The sun and moon did not move through the sky for a long period of time. This allowed Israel to finish the battle against their enemies.

**the nation:** The phrase *the nation* refers to the Israelites.

**took vengeance upon its enemies:** The clause *took vengeance upon its enemies* indicates that the Israelites defeated the Amorites.

#### 10:13c

**Is this not written in the Book of Jashar?**

* This event is written in the Book of Jashar.
* This is written down in the Book of Jashar.

**Is this not written in the Book of Jashar?:** This is a rhetorical question that functions as a statement. The expected response is “yes, it is.” It may be more natural in some languages to translate this as a statement. For example:

> This is what is written down in the Book of Jashar

**the Book of Jashar:** The term *Book of Jashar* probably refers to a collection of stories about wars. It is also mentioned one other place in the Old Testament, 2 Samuel 1:18\.10:13 Bratcher and Newman, p. 143\.

#### 10:13d

**“So the sun stopped in the middle of the sky**

* The sun remained in the middle of the sky,
* The sun stopped in the middle of the sky,

**So the sun stopped in the middle of the sky:** Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> The sun stayed in the midst of heaven (RSV)

#### 10:13e

**and delayed going down about a full day.”**

* and did not set for a whole day.
* and Yahweh delayed it’s going down for almost a whole day.

**and delayed going down about a full day:** This clause adds information about the length of time the sun did not move in the sky. Yahweh made the sun stay in one place for about one day. The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as *delayed going down* is a Hebrew idiom.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> and did not go down for a whole day (GNT)

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 10:13

#### 10:14a

**There has been no day like it before or since,**

* There has never been a day like this before or since,
* Never before or after this day was there anything like this.

**There has been no day like it before or since:** The clause *There has been no day like it before or since* indicates that the day when the Israelites fought the Amorites was an extraordinary day. In the history of the world, there was never a day when God answered such a bold request from a human being.

#### 10:14b

**when the LORD listened to the voice of a man,**

* a day when Yahweh listened to a man pray such a prayer.
* There was never a day on which Yahweh did something like that for somebody who prayed.

**when the LORD listened to the voice of a man:** There are two ways to interpret the clause *when the LORD listened to the voice of a man*.

1. It means that Yahweh listened to Joshua and granted his request. For example:

    > there has never been a day like this one before or since, when the Lord answered such a prayer (NLT) *(BSB, NLT, NIV, RSV, ESV, NASB, NCV, NJPS, REB, CEV, KJV)*

2. It means that Yahweh obeyed Joshua. For example:

    > never before, and never since, has there been a day like it, when the Lord obeyed a human being (GNT) *(GNT, GW, NAB, NET, NJB, NABRE)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\). This is followed by a majority of English versions. Sometimes the Hebrew word “to listen” can be translated as “obey.” But it is only used for humans or angels obeying God, not the other way around. A suggestion that God obeyed a human being seems unlikely.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> there has never been a day like it before or since, a day when the Lord listened to a man (NIV)

> never before and never since has the Lord done anything like that for someone who prayed (CEV)

#### 10:14c

**because the LORD fought for Israel.**

* Yahweh really did fight for Israel.
* Surely the Israelites won the battle because of what Yahweh did for them.

**because:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *because* can also mean “surely” or “certainly.” It is used to emphasize a statement. Some examples of its use in English translations are:

> surely the Lord was fighting for Israel! (NIV)

> the Lord really was fighting for Israel (CEV)

**the LORD fought for Israel:** The clause *the LORD fought for Israel* indicates that the Israelites were able to win the battle because of the miracles that Yahweh did for them.

**Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal.**

* Then Joshua and the Israelite soldiers went back to their camp at Gilgal.
* After the battle, Joshua and all the Israelites went back to their camp at Gilgal.

**Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal:** The phrase *all Israel* refers to the Israelite army. It may be more natural in some languages to translate the two subjects, *Joshua* and *all Israel*, as one compound phrase. For example:

> then Joshua and the entire Israelite army returned to their camp at Gilgal

##### **General Comment on 10:6–15**

These verses tell the story of the battle against the Amorites, which is completed in verse 15\. Verses 16–21 tell the story of the five Amorite kings who fled and hid in a cave. The CEV supplies some implicit information with verse 15:

> After the battle, Joshua and the Israelites went back to their camp at Gilgal. (CEV)

This implicit information may help to clarify the transition between verse 15 and 16\.

**Now the five kings had fled and hidden in the cave at Makkedah.**

* ¶ However, the five kings ran away and hid in a cave near Makkedah.
* ¶ During the battle, the five Amorite kings escaped and hid in a cave at Makkedah City.

**Now the five kings:** The phrase *the five kings* refers to the five Amorite kings who joined together to fight the Israelites. There is a list of these kings in 10:3\.

**had fled:** The verb *fled* indicates that the kings ran away from the battle. There is implicit information: The five kings ran away before the battle finished. They probably ran away when they realized that the Israelites would win the battle. It may be more natural in some languages to include the implicit information in this part of the verse. For example:

> During the battle the five kings escaped (NLT)

> While the enemy soldiers were running from the Israelites, the five enemy kings ran away (CEV)

**and hidden in the cave at Makkedah:** The phrase *in the cave at Makkedah* refers to a cave near the town of Makkedah. 10:10 stated that the Israelite army chased the Amorite armies as far as the towns of Azekah and Makkedah. The five enemy kings found a cave near Makkedah where they could hide from the Israelites.

#### 10:17a

**And Joshua was informed:**

* Someone told Joshua:
* And Joshua heard the news that

**And Joshua was informed:** The phrase *Joshua was informed* indicates that somebody spoke to Joshua. This passive form makes it possible to leave the speaker unnamed. Use a form in your language to indicate that the speaker is not known.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> Someone told Joshua

> Joshua heard the news that

> Joshua’s soldiers told him (CEV)

#### 10:17b

**“The five kings have been found; they are hiding in the cave at Makkedah.”**

* “We have found the five Amorite kings. They are hiding in a cave near Makkedah.”
* they found the five enemy kings hidden in a cave at Makkedah City.

**The five kings have been found:** The clause *The five kings have been found* is a passive construction. If a passive construction is not natural, it is possible to translate this clause in the active voice.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> We have found the five kings

> They have found the five enemy kings.

**they are hiding in the cave at Makkedah:** The town of Makkedah was mentioned in 10:10\. It may be more natural in some languages to translate the clause *hiding in the cave at Makkedah* as an independent sentence. For example:

> They are hiding in a cave near the town of Makkeda

**So Joshua said:** The clause *So Joshua said* is a result clause. Joshua gave a command as a result of what the soldiers told him. For example:

> Therefore

Use an appropriate means to indicate result in your language.

**Joshua said:** It may be more natural in some languages to translate the word *said* as “commanded” or “answered.” It may also be more natural to include the addressee in the clause. For example:

> So Joshua commanded them

**Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave:** Joshua told his soldiers to *Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave* so that the entrance to the cave was closed. The five kings could not leave the cave until the Israelites finished fighting the battle. It may be more natural in some languages to make this information explicit. For example:

#### 10:19a

**But you, do not stop there.**

* But as for you, don’t stay there.
* However, don’t stay there yourselves.

**But you, do not stop there:** The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as *you, do not stop there* is more literally “you, do not stand.” The pronoun “you” is in an emphatic position. Use whatever way is natural in your language to give this emphasis.

The clause *do not stop there* indicates that Joshua made a distinction between the people who gave the order to guard the cave and the people who guarded it.

#### 10:19b

**Pursue your enemies and attack them from behind.**

* Chase after your enemies and kill those who are at the back.
* Continue chasing the enemy, attack them from behind.

* Don’t let them get into their cities.
* Don’t let them escape behind their city walls.

**Do not let them reach their cities:** The clause *Do not let them reach their cities* indicates that Joshua commanded the Israelite army to kill the enemy soldiers before they could return to their walled towns.

* and destroying almost all of them.
* until there were hardly any left alive.

**until they had finished them off:** The clause *until they had finished them off* indicates that the Israelite army killed almost all the Amorite soldiers. This clause restates the information in 10:20a. It emphasizes how completely the Israelites defeated the Amorites. If repetition is not a natural way to show emphasis, it may be more natural to combine 20a and b. For example,

> So Joshua and the Israelites killed the enemy (NCV)

> Joshua and the Israelites defeated them decisively, almost destroying them (GW)

In some languages there may be grammatical particles or other means that you can use to emphasize this important information in the story.

#### 10:20c

**The whole army returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah:** The clause *returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah* indicates that Joshua had made a temporary camp at Makkedah and waited there for the army to return from battle.

**Makkedah:** The town of *Makkedah* was mentioned in 10:10\. Makkedah was in the southern part of Canaan, about 14 kilometers west of Hebron.10:21 Rasmussen, p. 244\. Joshua made his camp there temporarily while the Israelite army attacked the towns in the south of Canaan.

##### **General Comment on 10:20a\-21a**

It may be clearer in some languages to split this long sentence into several shorter sentences. For example:

> 20aJoshua and the Israelite soldiers killed almost all of the Amorite soldiers. 20bThere were hardly any left alive. 20cThose who were still alive ran into their fortified towns. 21aThen all the Israelite soldiers returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah.

* When they brought the kings out to Joshua,
* When the soldiers brought them out,

**When they had brought the kings to Joshua:** The clause *When they had brought the kings to Joshua* repeats information already stated in 10:23\. It links 10:23 with 10:24 and emphasizes that the soldiers obeyed Joshua’s commands. This head\-tail linkage is natural in some languages but not in others. It may be more natural to leave some of this information implicit. For example,

**he summoned all the men of Israel:** The clause *he summoned* indicates that he called all the soldiers together.

**all the men of Israel:** The phrase *all the men of Israel* refers to all the soldiers in the Israelite army.

**and said to the army commanders who had accompanied him:** It may be more natural in some languages to begin a new sentence. For example:

> He told the army officers

**the army commanders:** The phrase *the army commanders* indicates the officers of the Israelite army.

**who had accompanied him:** The relative clause *who had accompanied him* refers to the officers of Joshua’s army. If translating this clause implies that there were some officers who did not go with Joshua, it may be better to leave it untranslated.10:24 Bratcher and Newman, p. 149\. Some English versions leave this information implicit. For example:

> He said to the commanders of his army (NCV)

**“Come here and put your feet on the necks of these kings.”**

* “Come here. Put your feet on the necks of these five kings.”
* to put their feet on the necks of the five kings as a sign of victory.

**Come here:** The clause *Come here* indicates that Joshua commanded his officers to come close to where he was.

**and put your feet on the necks of these kings:** Joshua ordered his officers to *put your feet on the necks of these kings* because this symbolized victory in the Ancient Near East. There is implied information. Before the army officers could put their feet on the necks of the defeated kings, they must force the kings to lie down. It may be helpful to make this implied information explicit. For example:

> Make the five kings lie down and put your feet on their necks

#### 10:24d

**So the commanders came forward and put their feet on their necks.**

* So the officers did exactly as Joshua told them to do.
* So the commanders obeyed Joshua and put their feet on their necks.

**So the commanders came forward:** The clause *commanders came forward* indicates that the army officers came close to Joshua as he had told them to.

**and put their feet on their necks:** Joshua’s command to the soldiers in the first part of the verse is repeated using the same words to emphasize that the army officers obeyed Joshua exactly. It may not be natural in some languages to repeat this information in the same words. In other languages it may be more natural to make a summary statement. For example:

> So the army commanders did exactly as Joshua had commanded them

> The officers obeyed Joshua and did so.

### Section 10:1–27 Five Canaanite Kings attacked the Israelites

The kings of five Canaanite towns joined together to fight against Gibeon. Because the Israelites had a peace treaty with Gibeon, they helped them in their fight. Yahweh helped the Israelites by sending down hailstones on the Canaanites, and by causing the sun to stop moving so that the Israelites could continue their victory. The five Canaanite kings were captured and put to death.

Here are some other possible section headings:

> Israel defeated the Canaan group

> The sun stood still

#### 10:25a

**“Do not be afraid or discouraged,” Joshua said.**

* Then Joshua said to them: “Do not ever be afraid at all.
* And Joshua said to the officers: “Do not be afraid or discouraged.

**“Do not be afraid or discouraged,” Joshua said:** Use whatever connecting word is natural to indicate continuing narrative action.

**Do not be afraid or discouraged:** The two words *afraid* and *discouraged* have a similar meaning. This command is similar to the command that Yahweh gave to Joshua in 1:9 and uses the same words that Yahweh spoke to Joshua in 8:1\. These two words together indicate that the Israelites should not be afraid at all.

#### 10:25b

**“Be strong and courageous,**

* Be strong and brave.
* Be determined and have courage,

**Be strong and courageous:** The command *Be strong and courageous* repeats the words that Yahweh spoke to Joshua in 1:9\. It is recommended that you translate them in the same way as 1:9 if possible.

#### 10:25c

**for the LORD will do this to all the enemies you fight.”**

* Yahweh will defeat all your enemies as he defeated these kings.”
* because this is what Yahweh is going to do to all the people you fight against.”

**for the LORD will do this to all the enemies you fight:** The clause *for the LORD will do this to all the enemies you fight* indicates the reason that the Israelites did not have to be afraid. Yahweh will defeat all the Israelites’ enemies as he defeated the Amorite kings and their armies.

**you:** The pronoun *you* refers to the army commanders.

### Section 10:1–27 Five Canaanite Kings attacked the Israelites

The kings of five Canaanite towns joined together to fight against Gibeon. Because the Israelites had a peace treaty with Gibeon, they helped them in their fight. Yahweh helped the Israelites by sending down hailstones on the Canaanites, and by causing the sun to stop moving so that the Israelites could continue their victory.

#### 10:26a

**After this, Joshua struck down and killed the kings,**

* Then Joshua killed the kings
* After this, Joshua put the five kings to death,

**After this:** The phrase *After this* indicates that the next event took place after the officers put their feet on the necks of the kings.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> After the officers had done this

**Joshua struck down and killed the kings:** The two clauses *struck down* and *killed the kings* are parallel and have the same meaning. They indicate that Joshua killed the five kings. In some languages it may be more natural to use one verb rather than two to indicate this. For example:

> Then Joshua killed each of the five kings (NLT)

#### 10:26b

**and he hung their bodies on five trees**

* and hung their bodies on five poles,
* and hung their dead bodies on five trees,

**and he hung their bodies on five trees:** The clause *he hung their bodies on five trees* indicates that after Joshua killed the five kings, he hung them each on a tree as a public sign that God had cursed them. This was the same as Joshua did to the king of Ai in 8:29, and you should translate it in a similar way. See also Deuteronomy 21:22–23 where Moses gave rules for how such executions should be done.

#### 10:26c

**and left them there until evening.**

* where they hung until evening.
* and left them there until the evening.

**and left them there until evening:** The clause *and left them there until evening* indicates that Joshua left the five kings on the trees all day. In the evening, when the sun was setting, he took them down. This was commanded by Moses in Deuteronomy 21:23\.

#### 10:27a

**At sunset**

* But when the sun went down,
* When the sun was going down,

**At sunset:** The phrase *At sunset* refers to the time when the sun goes down. In some languages it may be more natural to begin a new sentence at this point. For example:

> when the sun was setting

#### 10:27b

**Joshua ordered that they be taken down from the trees**

* Joshua commanded his soldiers to take the bodies of the kings down from the trees.
* Joshua told the soldiers: “Take the bodies down,

**Joshua ordered:** It may be more natural in some languages to supply the direct object:

> Joshua commanded his soldiers.

**that they be taken down from the trees:** The clause *that they be taken down from the trees* indicates that Joshua’s soldiers took the bodies of the kings down from the trees where they were hanging.

#### 10:27c

**and thrown into the cave in which they had hidden.**

* The soldiers threw the bodies into the same cave where the kings hid.
* and throw them into the same cave where they hid themselves.”

**and thrown into the cave in which they had hidden:** The clause *and thrown into the cave in which they had hidden* indicates that Joshua’s soldiers threw the bodies of the dead kings into the same cave in which they first hid. It may be more natural in some languages to begin a new sentence here. It may also be helpful to make the subject and object explicit. For example:

> Then the soldiers threw the bodies into the same cave where they had been hiding

#### 10:27d

**Then large stones were placed against the mouth of the cave,**

* They covered the opening of the cave with large rocks,
* Then the soldiers covered the cave entrance with large stones.

**Then large stones were placed against the mouth of the cave:** The clause *Then large stones were placed against the mouth of the cave* indicates that after the soldiers threw the dead bodies into the cave, they covered up the cave entrance again with large rocks. The place where the kings hid themselves to escape Joshua’s army became their tomb.

#### 10:27e

**and the stones are there to this day.**

* which are there to this day.
* Those stones are still there to this day.

**and the stones are there to this day:** In some languages it may be more natural to begin a new sentence at this point. For example:

> The stones remain there until this day

**to this day:** The phrase *to this day* indicates that, at the time the author wrote the book of Joshua, the stones were still there.

Here is another possible section heading:

> Israel defeated the southern towns

#### 10:28a

**On that day Joshua captured Makkedah**

* ¶ That day Joshua defeated the city of Makkedah.
* ¶ On that same day, Joshua and the Israelites attacked and defeated Makkedah City.

**On that day:** The phrase *On that day* indicates that Joshua and the Israelite army attacked and captured Makkedah on the same day that they killed the five kings.

**Joshua captured Makkedah:** The clause *Joshua captured Makkedah* indicates that Joshua and the Israelite army captured the town of *Makkedah*. It may be necessary in some languages to make explicit that the Israelite army also fought, and that Joshua did not capture Makkedah by himself. For example:

> Joshua and the Israelites captured the town of Makkedah on that day

**Makkedah:** The town of *Makkedah* was about 40 kilometers southwest of Gibeon.10:28 Bratcher and Newman, p. 151\. The cave where the five Amorite kings hid was near *Makkedah*. After Joshua killed the five kings, he and his army proceeded to capture this nearby town.

#### 10:28b

**and put it to the sword, along with its king.**

* He killed the king and the people of the city with his sword.
* They killed the king and the people of this city.

**and put it to the sword, along with its king:** This indicates that Joshua and the Israelite army killed the king of Makkedah and the people who lived there.

**put it to the sword:** The phrase *put it to the sword* is a Hebrew idiom. The word “smote” is the past tense of “smite.” It means “hit.” This idiom means that they killed the king and the people of Makkedah.

Here is another way to translate this Hebrew idiom:

> Joshua killed its king and everyone else in the town (CEV)

#### 10:28c

**He devoted to destruction everyone in the city, leaving no survivors.**

* He devoted them to Yahweh for destruction. He killed them all.
* They killed every single person because Yahweh claimed them.

**He devoted to destruction everyone in the city:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *devoted to destruction everyone* comes from the same root word as the term “devoted for destruction” used in 6:17b. It refers to people or things that are claimed by Yahweh and cannot be bought back by any means. They must be destroyed. If possible, translate this word in the same way as you did in 6:17b. For example:

> he devoted to destruction every person in it (ESV)

**leaving no survivors:** The clause *leaving no survivors* indicates that not a single person was left alive in the town.

#### 10:28d

**So he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.**

* He did the same thing to the king of Makkedah that he did to the king of Jericho.
* He killed the king of Makkedah City in the same way that he killed the king of Jericho City.

**So he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho:** The pronoun *he* refers to Joshua. The clause *he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho* indicates that Joshua killed the king of Makkedah. It may be clearer to make this information explicit. For example:

> and he killed the king of Makkedah as he had killed the king of Jericho (NLT)

A similar phrase was used in 8:2 referring to the king of Ai.

* Then Joshua and the Israelites went from Makkedah to Libnah
* Joshua and the soldiers left Makkedah City and went to Libnah City

**Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Makkedah:** The clause *Then Joshua…moved on from Makkedah* indicates that Joshua left the town of Makkedah.

**and all Israel with him:** The phrase *and all Israel with him* indicates that the whole Israelite army went with him. The terms “Joshua” and *all Israel* are both the subjects of this sentence. In some languages it may be more natural to put them together. For example:

> Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Makkedah to Libnah (NIV)

> Then Joshua, along with his whole army, left Makkedah and went to fight against Libnah.

**to Libnah:** The town of *Libnah* was about 11 kilometers southwest of Makkedah.

#### 10:29b

**and fought against Libnah.**

* Yahweh gave the Israelites victory over Libnah and its king,

**And the LORD also delivered that city and its king into the hand of Israel:** The clause *the LORD also delivered that city and its king into the hand of Israel* indicates that Yahweh gave Joshua and the Israelite army the power to defeat the king and the town of Libnah. They captured the town of Libnah as they had captured the town of Makkedah.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> The Lord also gave that city and its king into Israel’s hand (NIV)

> The Lord also gave the Israelites victory over this city and its king (GNT)

#### 10:30b

**and Joshua put all the people to the sword,**

* The Israelites killed every single person in the city with their swords.
* and they killed the king and all the people.

**and Joshua:** There are two ways to understand the pronoun “he,” which the BSB translates as *Joshua*.

1. The pronoun “he” refers to Joshua and the Israelite army. For example:

    > the city and everyone in it Joshua put to the sword (NIV) *(BSB, NIV, NET, NJPS, GNT, NLT, NCV, CEV)*

2. The pronoun “he” refers to Yahweh. For example:

    > and he struck it with the edge of the sword, and every person in it (ESV) *(ESV, RSV, GW, NABRE, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\). The pronoun “he” probably to refers to Joshua as the representative of the Israelite army, or to the Israelite army itself.

**put all the people to the sword:** The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as *put all the people to the sword* is an idiom. It indicates that Joshua and his army killed every person in the town of Libnah.

Here is another way to translate this Hebrew idiom:

> he killed all the people (GW)

> killed every person in it (GNT)

#### 10:30c

**leaving no survivors.**

* Not a single person was left alive.
* They didn’t let any of them live.

**leaving no survivors:** The clause *leaving no survivors* indicates that there were no people still alive in Libnah after the Israelite army attacked it. This information was stated in a positive manner in the previous part of the verse. It is restated here negatively. This is a way to emphasize that every single person died.

Here is another way to translate 30b\-c:

> Joshua and his army killed everyone in Libnah with their swords, leaving no survivors

#### 10:30d

**And he did to the king of Libnah as he had done to the king of Jericho.**

* And they did the same thing to the king that they did to the king of Jericho.
* Joshua killed the king of Libnah in the same way that he killed the king of Jericho.

**And he did to the king of Libnah as he had done to the king of Jericho:** The clause *he did to the king of Libnah as he had done to the king of Jericho* is similar to the clause in 10:28d. It indicates that Joshua killed the king of Libnah. You should translate this in a similar way to 10:28d.

It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. For example:

> Then Joshua killed the king of Libnah as he had killed the king of Jericho (NLT)

**And Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Libnah to Lachish:** The clause *Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Libnah to Lachish* has similar wording to 10:29a. It indicates that Joshua and his army went from Libnah to Lachish. It is recommended that you translate this clause in the same way that you translated the clause in 10:29a.

**Lachish:** The town of *Lachish* was about 17 kilometers south of Libnah.10:31 Bratcher and Newman, p. 152\.

#### 10:31b

**He put all the people to the sword:** The clause *put all the people to the sword* is a Hebrew idiom. This is the same wording as the clauses in 10:28b and 10:30b. It is recommended that you translate it in a similar way.

The king of Lachish is not mentioned because he was one of the five kings who led the battle against the Gibeonites. Joshua killed him by the cave at Makkedah (10:23, 26\).

#### 10:32c

**just as he had done to Libnah.**

* He spared no one, as he did at Libnah.
* They killed everybody there, as they did at Libnah City.

**just as he had done to Libnah:** The clause *as he had done to Libnah* refers to what Joshua did to the people of Libnah. It may be more natural in some languages to make this information explicit. For example:

**At that time Horam king of Gezer went to help Lachish,**

* ¶ At this time Horam king of Gezer came to help Lachish,
* ¶ At that time King Horam of Gezer City came to help the people of Lachish City.

**At that time Horam king of Gezer:** *Horam* is the only king in this list of kings and towns who is mentioned by name. The grammar of this sentence is also different from the usual narrative storyline pattern in Hebrew.

The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *At that time* indicates that the action that follows has special prominence. This verse stands at the center of the narrative about these seven towns.10:33 Boling and Wright, p. 294\. It emphasizes the military leadership of Joshua because *Horam king of Gezer* came to the help of Lachish. However, Joshua and the Israelites defeated both Horam’s army and the army of Lachish. Some English versions give prominence to this verse in the following ways:

> During this same time King Horam of Gezer came to help Lachish (NCV)

> During the attack on Lachish, King Horam of Gezer arrived with his army to help defend the town (NLT)

> At that time King Horam of Gezer had come to help Lachish (GW)

**Gezer:** The town of *Gezer* is probably about 35 kilometers north of Lachish.10:33 Bratcher and Newman, p. 152\.

**went to help Lachish:** The phrase *went to help* is used in a military sense. It indicates that the king and his army came prepared to fight a battle.10:33 Boling and Wright, p. 292\.

#### 10:33b

**but Joshua struck him down along with his people, leaving no survivors.**

* But Joshua defeated him and his army, and no one was left alive.
* But Joshua killed him and his soldiers, and they all died.

**but:** The BSB used the word *but* here to indicate that what happens is surprising and not what was expected.

**Joshua struck him down along with his people:** The clause *Joshua struck him down along with his people* indicates that Joshua and the Israelite army killed the king of Gezer and his army.

**leaving no survivors:** The clause *leaving no survivors* indicates that the Israelite army continued to attack the army of the king of Gezer until every soldier had died.

**So Joshua moved on from Lachish to Eglon, and all Israel with him:** The clause *Joshua moved on from Lachish to Eglon, and all Israel with him* has similar wording as 10:31a. The town of Eglon was about 16 kilometers west of Lachish.10:34 Bratcher and Newman, p. 152\. It is possible to translate this clause in the same way as 10:31a.

**That day they captured Eglon and put it to the sword,**

* They captured it that day and killed the people in it with their swords.
* They captured it that same day, then killed everyone in it.

**That day they captured Eglon:** The clause *That day they captured Eglon* indicates that Joshua and the Israelite army captured the town and its inhabitants on the same day that they attacked it. In some languages, it is more natural to reverse the order of the words in this phrase. For example:

> They captured Eglon City that same day

**That day:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *That day* is stated twice in this verse for emphasis. It contrasts the fact that the Israelites captured and destroyed the town of Eglon in one day, whereas it took them two days to capture the town of Lachish.

**and put it to the sword:** The clause *put it to the sword* indicates that the Israelite army killed the people of the town. This is a Hebrew idiom that was used in 10:28, and it is recommended that you translate it the same way in both places.

* On that day they killed every single person because Yahweh claimed them.

**and Joshua devoted to destruction everyone in the city:** The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as *and Joshua devoted to destruction everyone in the city* has the object stated first because this is a way that the Hebrew language indicates prominence or emphasis. Other languages may have a different way to show emphasis. Indicate emphasis that is natural in your language.

**Joshua:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Joshua* refers to Joshua as the representative of the Israelite army. In some languages it may be more natural to include this implied information. For example:

> Joshua and the Israelite soldiers utterly destroyed the town of Eglon that day

**devoted to destruction:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *devoted to destruction* is the same verb used in 10:28c. It refers to people or things that are claimed by Yahweh and cannot be bought back by any means. They must be destroyed.

#### 10:35c

**just as he had done to Lachish.**

* as he did to Lachish.
* This was same as they did to Lachish City.

* ¶ Then Joshua and his soldiers went from Eglon uphill to Hebron,
* ¶ Then Joshua and all the Israelite army marched from Eglon City to Hebron City.

**Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up:** The Hebrew text says *Joshua…went* *up* to Hebron, because Hebron was in the high hill country. Joshua walked from Eglon to a higher elevation. In languages that do not keep track of elevation, it may be more natural to say:

> Then Joshua went

**and all Israel with him:** The phrase *all Israel with him* indicates that Joshua led the whole Israelite army to Hebron.

**just as he had done at Eglon:** The clause *just as he had done at Eglon* is similar to the clause in verse 10:35c. It is recommended that you translate it in a similar way.

**he devoted to destruction Hebron and everyone in it:** The clause *he devoted to destruction Hebron and everyone in it* is similar to verse 10:35b.

* They captured it with its king and all the towns near it
* They captured Debir City and its king, and the villages under its control

**And they captured Debir, its king, and all its villages:** In some languages it may be more natural to begin a new sentence, as in the BSB. The clause *they captured Debir, its king, and all its villages* is similar to verse 10:37a\-b. It indicates that the Israelite army captured the king and all the people of Debir and he also captured the small towns that were close by.

#### 10:39b

**leaving no survivors:** The clause *leaving no survivors* indicates that not a single person was left alive in the town of Debir and the surrounding towns.

#### 10:39e

#### 10:40a

**So Joshua conquered the whole region—**

* ¶ So Joshua defeated the kings of all the cities in this region.
* ¶ In this way Joshua conquered the whole land of Southern Canaan.

**So Joshua conquered the whole region:** *Joshua* is named as the leader of the Israelite army. He defeated *the whole region* by leading the army as they fought. In some languages it may be more natural to include the Israelite army with Joshua as a compound subject. For example:

> Joshua and the Israelite soldiers defeated the whole land

**the whole region:** The phrase *the whole region* refers to the region of southern Canaan. The towns that the Israelite army captured in chapter 10 were all in southern Canaan.

#### 10:40b

**the Negev:** The phrase *the Negev* refers to the wilderness area south of Canaan.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> the dry country in the south (GNT)

> the Southern Desert (CEV)

**and the slopes:** The phrase *the slopes* refers to the steep slopes that lead down from the hill country eastward to the Dead Sea.

**together with all their kings:** The phrase *all their kings* refers to the kings of the towns in these areas. It may be more natural in some languages to include the term about the kings in the first part of the verse, as in GNT:

> Joshua conquered the whole land. He defeated the kings of the hill country, the eastern slopes, and the western foothills, as well as those of the dry country in the south. (GNT)

#### 10:40c

**leaving no survivors. He devoted to destruction everything that breathed,**

* He did not let anybody live. He killed all the people.
* He killed all the people, and none of them were left alive,

**leaving no survivors:** The clause *leaving no survivors* has occurred five times in verses 10:28–39\. It is repeated to emphasize that Joshua obeyed Yahweh’s command in Deuteronomy 20:16–18 to destroy everyone in the land of Canaan. It is recommended that you translate it the same way each time.

**He devoted to destruction everything that breathed:** The clause *devoted to destruction everything that breathed* is similar to the clauses in verses 28, 35, 37, and 39\.

**devoted to destruction:** The phrase *devoted to destruction* translates the Hebrew verb that means a person or thing is claimed by Yahweh and cannot be bought back by any means, but must be destroyed.

**everything that breathed:** The phrase *everything that breathed* means “every person.” It does not refer to animals. This expression is also used in Deuteronomy 20:16\.

#### 10:40d

**just as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded.**

* This was what Yahweh the God of Israel commanded.
* as Yahweh the God of Israel said.

**just as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded:** The clause *as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded* refers to the command that Yahweh gave to Joshua and the Israelites through Moses in Deuteronomy 20:16–18\. It may be more natural in some languages to state this as an independent sentence. For example:

> This was what the Lord God of Israel had commanded. (GNT)

It is recommended that you include a footnote or a reference to Deuteronomy 20:16–18\.

* Joshua conquered them from Kadesh Barnea town in the south to Gaza City by the Mediterranean Sea.

**Joshua conquered the area:** The clause *Joshua conquered the area* continues the summary of what Joshua did.

**from Kadesh\-barnea:** *Kadesh\-barnea* was a town on the southeast boundary of Canaan, more than 80 kilometers south of Debir. It was the southernmost town that Joshua conquered.

Here is another way to spell Kadesh\-barnea:

**in one campaign:** The phrase *in one campaign* indicates that Joshua and the Israelite army were able to conquer all the kings and lands in one continuous military campaign. It does not indicate how many days this campaign lasted. The army began their battle against the five Amorite kings at Gibeon and then continued on from town to town until they had defeated them all.

#### 10:42b

* Joshua conquered these kings and their cities all at one time.
* Joshua conquered all these kings and their territory in one continuous battle.

**Chinnereth:** *Chinnereth* refers to Lake Galilee.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> the Jordan valley south of Lake Galilee (GNT)

> King Jabin also sent messengers to the kings of the Canaan people

**in the east and west:** The phrase *in the east and west* indicates the east and west sides of the Jordan River.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

It is 43 kilometers southwest of Damascus and 2,814 meters high. It is the tallest mountain in Israel.11:3 Rasmussen, p. 238\.

**at the foot of Hermon:** The Hivites lived near the foot of Hermon Mountain. Hermon Mountain is covered with snow most of the year. It was the dominant feature of the landscape above the Hivite people.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> the Hivite kings in the region of Mizpah, near the foot of Mount Hermon (CEV)

**in the land of Mizpah:** The term *Mizpah* refers to a valley at the foot of Hermon Mountain. There are several towns mentioned in the Bible that are named Mizpah, but they are in other places. The Mizpah mentioned here is only mentioned again in Joshua 11:8\.11:3 Rasmussen, p. 245\.

##### **General Comment on verses 11:1–3**

These verses contain a list of the names of towns and their kings to whom King Jabin of Hazor sent messengers. He asked them to help him fight the Israelites. In some languages it may be helpful to state this information at the beginning of 11:1\. For example:

#### 11:4a

**So these kings came out with all their armies, a multitude**

* They came out with all their soldiers, a lot of them.
* The kings of these cities gathered together, and there were many soldiers.

**So:** The Hebrew connector that the BSB translates as *So* introduces the next event in the story. Here it also indicates result. The kings and their armies marched out in response to the message they had received from King Jabin of Hazor.

**these kings:** The pronoun *these kings* indicates the kings of the towns referred to in verse 3\.

**came out with all their armies:** The verb *came out* indicates that the kings gathered their troops together and came out of their towns to fight against the Israelites.

#### 11:4b

**as numerous as the sand on the seashore,**

* There were so many soldiers they could not be counted. There were as many as the grains of sand beside the sea.

**as numerous as the sand on the seashore:** The phrase *as numerous as the sand on the seashore* indicates a comparison. The number of Canaanite soldiers gathered to fight against the Israelites is compared to the grains of sand on the beach by the sea. There were so many that it was impossible to count them. In some languages it may be helpful to make this comparison clearer. For example:

> there were so many soldiers that they could not be counted. It was like counting the sand that is on the seashore

#### 11:4c

**along with a great number of horses and chariots.**

* and they had many horses and chariots.
* They had many horses which pulled war carts.

**along with a great number of horses and chariots:** The *horses* were used to pull the *chariots*. At that time, the Israelite army did not have any horses or chariots. The Canaanite army had more soldiers and had better weapons than the Israelites. This made the Israelite victory even more remarkable and showed that it was only possible because God fought for them.

**chariots:** The *chariots* were light carts that were each pulled by one or two horses. There was room in the chariot for two soldiers. One drove the horses and the other was free to fight with a sword or with bow and arrows.

Here are some other ways to translate this term:

> war cart

> horse\-drawn war cart

* at the waters of Merom, and camped there
* to the Merom River and set up their camp together there.

**and encamped:** The clause *and encamped* indicates that all the armies set up their camps as if they were one army.

**at the waters of Merom:** The exact location of the *waters of Merom* is uncertain. It was probably a riverbed where waters flowed during rainstorms. It was probably somewhere between the Sea of Galilee and the Mediterranean coast.11:5 Howard p. 267 and footnote 264\.

Here is another way to translate this term:

> Merom Brook (GNT)

#### 11:5c

**Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them,**

* Then Yahweh said to Joshua: “Do not be afraid of them.
* Then Yahweh told Joshua: “Do not be afraid of the Canaanite armies

**Then:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Then* indicates the continuing action of the narrative. Yahweh gave instructions to Joshua after the armies gathered to fight against the Israelites.

**Do not be afraid of them:** Yahweh told Joshua not to be afraid of the enemies. Yahweh gave him this same encouragement before the battle of Ai (Joshua 8:1\) and the battle at Gibeon (Joshua 10:8\).

#### 11:6b

**for by this time tomorrow I will deliver all of them slain before Israel.**

* By this time tomorrow I will kill all of them and hand them over to Israel.
* because I am going to give them to you Israelites. At this time tomorrow they will all be dead.

**for by this time tomorrow:** The phrase *by this time tomorrow* indicates the time that Yahweh will help the Israelites to defeat the armies of the northern kings.

**I will deliver all of them slain before Israel:** The clause *I will deliver all of them slain before Israel* indicates that Yahweh will kill the enemies of the Israelites. It is evident from verses 6–7 that the Israelites had a part in pursuing their enemies and killing them. However, this happened only because Yahweh enabled them to do it.

**slain:** The word *slain* is from the verb “to slay” which means “to kill.” Yahweh said that he would kill the enemies.

**before Israel:** Yahweh said he would give the Canaanite soldiers *before Israel*. Since Yahweh was talking to Joshua, it may be clearer in some languages to translate this:

> to you

> to you Israelites

#### 11:6c

**You are to hamstring their horses**

* Then you must cut the hamstrings of their horses
* You must cut the legs of their horses so that they cannot be used in battle

**You are to hamstring their horses:** The word *to hamstring* means to cut the large tendon, the “hamstring,” that runs down the back of the horse’s hind leg. The Israelites were to cut the hamstrings of the Canaanite horses so that they would not be able to walk. They did this so that the enemy armies could not use the horses that survived.

Here are some other ways to translate this clause:

> cut the hamstrings of their horses

> cut the legs of their horses so that they cannot be used to fight

#### 11:6d

**and burn up their chariots.”**

* and burn their chariots.”
* and burn up their chariots with fire.”

**and burn up their chariots:** The Hebrew text includes the words “with fire", which may be helpful to specific in some languages. For example:

> and burn their chariots with fire

In other languages, adding this might make it redundant, because it is already implied in the verb *burn*.

* Joshua and all his soldiers caught them by surprise.
* Joshua and his army made a surprise attack against the Canaanites.

**Joshua and his whole army came upon them suddenly:** The clause *Joshua and his whole army came upon them suddenly* indicates that Joshua and his army attacked the Canaanite armies by surprise. These words are similar to the words in 10:9, and you may be able to translate them in a similar way.

**and his whole army:** The phrase *and his whole army* indicates that Joshua’s entire army was with him. In Hebrew, this is more literally “all the people of war with him”.

Here are some other ways to translate this clause:

> Joshua and his whole army caught them by surprise (NET)

> So Joshua and his whole army came against them suddenly (NIV)

**and attacked them:** The clause *and attacked them* indicates that Joshua and his army attacked the enemy armies. It may be more natural in some languages to combine this clause with the clause in 11:7a, for example:

* The Israelites fought them and chased them as far as Great Sidon, and Misrephoth\-maim,
* The Israelites attacked them and chased them as far north as Great Sidon City and Misrephoth\-maim City,

**who struck them down:** The word *struck* comes from the verb “to strike” which means “to hit.” This is an idiom for killing. The clause *struck them* indicates that the Israelite army killed many soldiers in the enemy army. It may be more natural in some languages to begin a new sentence here. For example:

> The Israelites killed them

**and pursued them:** The clause *pursued them* indicates that the Israelite army chased the Canaanites as they ran away and killed the people whom they overtook.

**all the way to Greater Sidon:** The town of *Greater Sidon* was to the northwest on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea.11:8 Hess, p. 112, Map B.

**and Misrephoth\-maim:** The location of the town of *Misrephoth\-maim* is uncertain. It was probably north of Galilee, near Sidon, possibly near the Litani River.11:8 Rasmussen, p. 245\. Some scholars think it was on the coast near the modern border between Lebanon and Israel.11:8 Boling and Wright, p. 308\.

**and eastward as far as the Valley of Mizpeh:** The Israelite army chased them in a circular path around the borders of Galilee. They went northwest towards Greater Sidon and then south towards the town of Misrephoth\-maim. Then they turned eastward to *the Valley of Mizpeh*.

This *Valley of Mizpeh* is probably the same place as the “land of Mizpah” mentioned in verse 11:3c. It is recommended that you spell this name the same way in both places.

#### 11:8d

**They struck them down, leaving no survivors.**

* They kept on killing them until none of them were still alive.
* They attacked them until they were all dead.

**They struck them down:** The clause *They struck them down* indicates that the Israelite army killed the enemy soldiers. This clause is like the clause in 11:8b. It is repeated here for emphasis.

**leaving no survivors:** The clause *leaving no survivors* indicates that the Israelite army killed all the soldiers who had gathered to attack them.

It may be more natural in some languages to translate this clause as an independent sentence. For example:

> None of the enemy soldiers escaped alive (CEV)

> They killed them until all of them were dead

**he hamstrung their horses:** The clause *he hamstrung their horses* indicates that Joshua had the tendons in the back legs of the enemy horses cut so that they could not walk. Probably Joshua ordered his soldiers to do this. He did not do it himself. It may be clearer in some languages to make this information explicit. Translate this using similar words to 11:6c.

**and burned up their chariots:** The clause *burned up their chariots* indicates that Joshua had his soldiers burn the enemy chariots. Translate this using similar words to 11:6d.

#### 11:10c

**because Hazor was formerly the head of all these kingdoms.**

* because at that time the king of Hazor City was the leader of all the Canaanite kingdoms.
* They did this because he was the leader of all the kings who fought against the Israelites.

**because:** The word *because* introduces the reason why they attacked the town of Hazor.

This clause repeats the information of verse 20c using different words to emphasize how important this was. In some languages repetition may not be a natural way to show emphasis. There may be other lexical or grammatical means to indicate emphasis. Use whatever means is natural to indicate emphasis in your language.

#### 11:20e

**as the LORD had commanded Moses.**

* as Yahweh commanded Moses.
* because this was what Yahweh commanded Moses to tell them to do.

**as the LORD had commanded Moses:** It may be more natural in some languages to begin a new sentence here. The clause *as the LORD had commanded Moses* refers to the command that Yahweh gave Moses in Deuteronomy 7:2\. Yahweh commanded the Israelites to destroy the Canaanite people so that the Israelites would not be tempted to worship their gods.

In this section there is a summary of the towns that the Israelites conquered in the land of Canaan.

#### 11:21a

**At that time Joshua proceeded to eliminate the Anakim from the hill country**

* ¶ During this time Joshua killed all the Anakites who lived in the mountains
* ¶ At this time Joshua destroyed all the Anak people who lived in the hill country.

**At that time Joshua proceeded:** The Hebrew verb *proceeded* indicates continuation of action, rather than movement.11:21 Bratcher and Newman, p. 167\. Some English versions leave this verb untranslated, for example:

> Now Joshua fought… (NCV)

**At that time:** The phrase *At that time* indicates an indefinite time. It is close to the same time that Joshua and his army finished fighting the other enemy soldiers.

Some other ways to translate this phrase are:

> During this period (NLT)

> At this time (GNT)

**to eliminate:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *to eliminate* indicates that Joshua and his army killed all the Anakim.

**the Anakim:** The *Anakim* were a group of people who were descendants of Anak. The descendants of Anak were first referred to in Numbers 13:22–33\. At that time the Israelites were afraid of the Anakim and refused to enter the promised land. They did not trust Yahweh, and so they had to walk through the wilderness for forty years. Now the Israelites killed the Anakim.

Here are some other ways to translate this term:

> descendants of Anak (NLT)

> people of Anak (GW)

> Anakites (NIV, NET)

**from the hill country:** The term *hill country* indicates the central mountain range of the land of Israel. This is the same phrase used in 9:1 and you should translate it the same way that you did there.

#### 11:21b

**of Hebron, Debir, and Anab,**

* in the area of Hebron, Debir, and Anab,
* They lived in Hebron City, Debir City, and Anab Village,

**of Hebron:** Joshua destroyed the town of *Hebron* in 10:36–37\. Hebron was in the hill country of Judah, 32 kilometers southwest of Jerusalem.11:21 Rasmussen, p. 238\.

**Debir:** Joshua destroyed the town of *Debir* in 10:38–39\. Debir was 14 kilometers southwest of Hebron, in the hill country of Judah.11:21 Rasmussen, p. 232\.

**and Anab:** *Anab* was a village in the hill country of Judah. Anab was 19 kilometers southwest of Hebron.11:21 Rasmussen, p. 226\.

#### 11:21c

**and from all the hill country of Judah and of Israel.**

* and in the mountains of Judah and the mountains of Israel.
* and in the hill country of Judah and Israel.

**and from all the hill country of Judah:** The *hill country of Judah* indicates the central mountain range in the southern part of the land of Israel.

**and of Israel:** The *and of Israel* indicates the mountains in the northern part of the country.

It may be clearer to combine these two phrases into one. For example:

> from all the hill country of Judah and Israel

#### 11:21d

**Joshua devoted them to destruction, along with their cities.**

* Joshua completely destroyed them and their cities.
* Joshua killed them all and destroyed their cities.

**Joshua devoted them to destruction, along with their cities:** The phrase *with their cities* indicates that Joshua destroyed the Anakim people, and also the towns in which they lived.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 11:21

#### 11:22a

**No Anakim were left in the land of the Israelites;**

* There were no Anakites left living in the land of the Israelites,
* None of the Anak people were left in the land of Israel.

**No Anakim were left in the land of the Israelites:** The clause *No Anakim were left in the land of the Israelites* repeats the information of verse 21 in different words, to emphasize its importance.

**the land of the Israelites:** The phrase *the land of the Israelites* indicates the entire country of the Israelites. It includes both the southern part, which was called Judah in verse 21, and the northern part, which was called Israel.

#### 11:22b

**only in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod did any survive.**

* but there were a few left in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod.
* However, some still remained in the towns of Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod which Israel did not capture.

**only in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod:** The towns of *Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod* were in the territory of the Philistines. They were in southwestern Canaan, on the Mediterranean Sea.11:22 Howard, p. 275\.

**did any survive:** The clause *did any survive* indicates that some Anakim still lived in the towns of Gaza, Gath and Ashdod. The Israelites did not capture these towns.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> However, there were still some Anakim who lived in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod.

#### 11:23a

**So Joshua took the entire land,**

* ¶ So Joshua conquered of all the land
* ¶ In this way, Joshua and the Israelite people took control of the entire land of Israel.

**So Joshua took the entire land:** The clause *Joshua took the entire land* indicates that Joshua and the Israelite army conquered the whole land of Canaan. This verse is the conclusion to the first section of the book of Joshua. Chapter 12 contains a list of conquered kings and territories and forms a kind of appendix to chapter 11\.11:23 Howard, p. 275\.

#### 11:23b

**in keeping with all that the LORD had spoken to Moses.**

* as Yahweh told Moses to do long ago.
* This was what Yahweh instructed Moses long ago.

**in keeping with all that the LORD had spoken to Moses:** The phrase *in keeping with all that the LORD had spoken to Moses* indicates that Joshua followed every command that Yahweh gave to Moses. Yahweh told Moses to drive out all the other nations from the land of Canaan.

#### 11:23c

**And Joshua gave it as an inheritance to Israel according to the allotments to their tribes.**

* Then Joshua divided up the land and gave a part to each of the clans of Israel.
* And Joshua gave it to the people of Israel, giving a part to each clan.

**And Joshua gave it as an inheritance to Israel:** The clause *Joshua gave it as an inheritance to Israel* indicates that Joshua divided up the land for each tribe of Israel to live in. Each of the twelve tribes of Israel got a certain part of the land.

**inheritance:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *inheritance* is more literally “property.” Yahweh gave land to each tribe for that tribe to own. Each family could pass this land on to their children and grandchildren.

Here are some other ways to translate this term:

> a possession (GW)

> a gift (NLV)

In some languages it may be more natural to translate this term as a clause. For example:

> The Lord gave that land to Israel as he promised (ERV)

> Joshua gave it to the Israelites as their own (GNT)

**according to the allotments to their tribes:** The phrase *according to the allotments to their tribes* indicates that Joshua divided the land into sections and each tribe received one section of the land for their people to live in.

#### 11:23d

* And there was peace in the land.
* So, there was no more fighting in the land.

**Then the land had rest from war:** The clause *the land had rest from war* indicates that the Israelite army no longer fought. The soldiers could rest. The countryside was peaceful and no longer destroyed by battles.

> Then there was peace in the land

> Then there was no war in the land

### Section 12:1–24 The kings that Joshua and the Israelites defeated

In this section there is a list of the kings that the Israelites defeated on the east side and the west side of the Jordan River.

Here is another possible section heading:

> The kings that the Israelites defeated on both sides of the Jordan River

### Paragraph 12:1–6

The kings that the Israelites defeated on the east side of the Jordan River.

#### 12:1a

**Now these are the kings of the land**

* ¶ These are the kings of the land
* ¶ These are the names of the two kings

**Now:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Now* introduces a list of two kings that the Israelites defeated. Many English versions do not translate this word. Use a word that is appropriate to introduce a list in your language.

**these are the kings:** In some languages it may be more natural to say that these are the names of the kings.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> These are the names of the kings (REB)

**of the land:** The phrase *the land* indicates the land east of the Jordan River. This is not stated until 12:1c. It may be more natural in some languages to reorder this verse. A way to reorder the verse is found at the end of the notes for this verse.

#### 12:1b

**whom the Israelites struck down**

* whom the Israelite soldiers defeated
* whom the Israelites defeated before they crossed the Jordan River.

**whom the Israelites struck down:** The Israelites defeated these kings at an earlier time, before they crossed the Jordan River. This story is found in Numbers 21:21–35\. It may be helpful to express this implicit information.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> The people of Israel had defeated these kings before they crossed the Jordan River

**Israelites:** The word *Israelites* indicates the Israelite army.

#### 12:1c

**and whose lands they took beyond the Jordan to the east,**

* and whose territory the Israelites took east of the Jordan River.
* The Israelites captured their land east of the Jordan River.

**and whose lands they took:** The clause *whose lands they took* indicates that after the Israelites defeated the kings and their armies, they occupied their land and controlled it.

**beyond the Jordan to the east:** The phrase *beyond the Jordan to the east* indicates that the land was on the east side of the Jordan River.

#### 12:1d

**from the Arnon Valley to Mount Hermon, including all the Arabah eastward:**

* Their land went from the valley of the Arnon River to Mount Hermon, including all the eastern side of the Jordan River.
* These kings ruled the land from the Arnon River gorge in the south, to Mount Hermon in the north. They ruled all the land on the east side of the Jordan River.

**from the Arnon Valley to Mount Hermon:** The *Arnon Valley* and *Mount Hermon* were at the south and the north of the area that the Israelites conquered east of the Jordan River.

**the Arnon Valley:** The *Arnon* River flows through a deep *Valley* that is dry during part of the year. It runs into the Dead Sea. Its valley is halfway between the southern and northern ends of the Dead Sea. This was the southern limit of the land that the Israelites conquered on the east side of the Jordan River.12:1 Bratcher and Newman, p. 170\.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> the valley of the Arnon River

**Valley:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Valley* refers to a riverbed that has water in it only during the rainy season. This kind of riverbed is sometimes referred to by its Arabic term, *wadi*.

Here are some ways to translate this word:

> gorge (NLT, NIV)

> ravine (NCV)

> wadi (NRSV, REB, NJPS)

Use the word in your language that best fits this context.

**Mount Hermon:** *Mount Hermon* is west of Damascus. It was the northern limit of the land that the Israelites conquered on the east side of the Jordan River.

**including all the Arabah eastward:** The *Arabah* is the valley of the Jordan River. The land that the Israelites conquered included all the Jordan River valley and the land to the east of it.

##### **General Comment on 12:1**

Here are some other ways to translate verse 1\. These examples have partially reordered the parts of the verse. They have also broken the verse into two sentences.

> These are the kings of the land east of the Jordan River that the people of Israel defeated. Israel also took possession of their land from the Arnon Valley to Mount Hermon, and all the eastern plains. (GW)

> Before Moses died, he and the Israelites had defeated two kings east of the Jordan River. These kings had ruled the region from the Arnon River Gorge in the south to Mount Hermon in the north, including the eastern side of the Jordan River Valley. (CEV)

##### **General Comment on 12:1–5**

In the Hebrew text these verses are one long sentence, and the BSB translates them this way. It is recommended that you translate these verses as several sentences. Use the sentence breaks that are most natural in your language. There are some examples of how to do this the end of each verse.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 12:1

## Joshua 12:2 (id: 516346)

### Section 12:1–24 The kings that Joshua and the Israelites defeated

In this section there is a list of the kings that the Israelites defeated on the east side and the west side of the Jordan River.

Here is another possible section heading:

> The kings that the Israelites defeated on both sides of the Jordan River

### Paragraph 12:1–6

The kings that the Israelites defeated on the east side of the Jordan River.

#### 12:2a

**Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.**

* Sihon was the Amorite king who lived in Heshbon.
* The first king that the Israelites defeated was King Sihon of the Amor people. He lived in Heshbon City.

Verses 12:2–3 give a detailed description of the territory that King Sihon ruled. Verse 2 describes the eastern part of his territory starting from its south end. Verse 3 describes the western part of his territory that was in the Jordan River valley.

**Sihon king of the Amorites:** The story of how Moses and the Israelites conquered *Sihon king of the Amorites* is in Numbers 21:21–35\.

**the Amorites:** The word *Amorites* refers to a group of people who lived on the east side of the Jordan River. This word was used in 3:10\| and you should translate it the same way in both places.

**who lived in Heshbon:** King Sihon lived in *Heshbon*, which was the capital town of the Amorites. Heshbon was about 25 kilometers northeast of the Dead Sea.12:2 Bratcher and Newman, p. 171\.

#### 12:2b

**He ruled from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley,**

* His kingdom went from Aroer, on the edge of the Arnon River valley,
* His territory started at Aroer City in the south. Aroer City was on the edge of the Arnon River gorge.

**He ruled from Aroer:** The town of Aroer was beside the Arnon River. King Sihon’s territory started at Aroer in the south and went north from there.

Here is another way to translate this clause:

> King Sihon’s territory started at the town of Aroer

**on the rim of the Arnon Valley:** The clause *on the rim of the Arnon Valley* indicates that the town of Aroer was on the bank of the Arnon River. The Arnon River runs into the Dead Sea.

#### 12:2c

**along the middle of the valley, up to the Jabbok River (the border of the Ammonites),**

* from the middle of this valley to the Jabbok River, which is the border of Ammonites.
* It went north from the middle of the Arnon River gorge to the Jabbok River. The Jabbok River starts the territory of the Ammon people.

**along the middle of the valley:** The words *the valley* refers to the Arnon River valley. There is an interpretation issue here.

1. The Hebrew text reads “and the middle of the valley.” For example:

    > from the middle of the gorge (NIV) *(BSB, NIV, RSV, ESV, GW, CEV, NLT, NABRE, KJV)*

2. Some English versions say “from the town in the middle of the valley.” They add the word “town” because of Joshua 13:9 and 16 which describe the same place. For example:

    > including the city in the middle of the valley (NET) *(NET, GNT)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\) and translate *the middle of the valley* as in the BSB. This follows the Hebrew text.

**up to the Jabbok River:** The phrase *up to the Jabbok River* indicates that the Jabbok River was the northern boundary of King Sihon’s territory. It was also that beginning of Ammonite territory.

**the border of the Ammonites:** The phrase *the border of the Ammonites* indicates that the Jabbok River formed the boundary between the territory of King Sihon and the territory of the Ammonites.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> all the way to the Jabbok Valley bordering Ammonite territory (NET)

> to the Jabbok River, which is the border of the Ammonites (NIV)

**the Ammonites:** The term *Ammonites* indicates a group of people who lived in the country of Ammon. Ammon was a region or an area, not a town.

#### 12:2d

**that is, half of Gilead,**

* This was half of the region of Gilead.
* This territory of King Sihon was the southern half of the Gilead area.

**that is, half of Gilead:** The clause *half of Gilead* indicates that the territory which King Sihon ruled was half of the region of *Gilead*.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> This included half of Gilead (NIV)

> This territory included the southern half of the territory of Gilead (NLT)

**Gilead:** The term *Gilead* indicates the mountainous region north of the Dead Sea. The Gilead Region stretched from the east of the Jordan River to the desert.12:2 Rasmussen, p. 236\.

##### **General Comment on 12:2**

Here is another way to translate 12:2\. This example has divided the verse into three sentences.

> King Sihon of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, was defeated. His kingdom included Aroer, on the edge of the Arnon Gorge, and extended from the middle of the Arnon Gorge to the Jabbok River, which serves as a border for the Ammonites. This territory included the southern half of the territory of Gilead. (NLT)

#### 12:3a

**as well as the Arabah east of the Sea of Chinnereth**

* It included the land east of the Jordan River valley, from Lake Galilee,
* King Sihon’s territory included the valley of the Jordan River and the land east of it, from Lake Galilee in the north

Verse 12:3 continues the description of King Sihon’s territory. It describes the territory that he ruled in the valley of the Jordan River, starting from its north end. It may be clearer to start a new sentence here.

**as well as the Arabah:** The *Arabah* is the valley of the Jordan River.

**east of the Sea of Chinnereth:** The *Sea of Chinnereth* is another name for the Sea of Galilee. In the Jordan River valley, the territory of King Sihon extended north beyond the Jabbok River to the Sea of Galilee.

**east of:** The phrase *east of* indicates that King Sihon’s territory was east of the Jordan River. It extended eastward from the Jordan River to the desert.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> King Sihon’s territory included the east side of the Jordan River valley to the Sea of Galilee in the north

#### 12:3b

**to the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea),**

* and the Dead Sea,
* to the Dead Sea,

**to the Sea of the Arabah:** The *Sea of the Arabah* is another name for the Dead Sea.

**the Salt Sea:** The *Salt Sea* is another name for the Dead Sea. The Dead Sea is referred to by two different names in this verse. See how you translated this phrase in Joshua 3:16\.

#### 12:3c

**eastward through Beth\-jeshimoth,**

* to Beth\-jeshimoth,
* and went south to Beth\-jeshimoth City,

**through Beth\-jeshimoth:** *Beth\-jeshimoth* is a town referred to in Numbers 33:49\. It was the last place that the Israelites camped before crossing the Jordan River into Canaan. It is beside the Jordan River, at the northeast tip of the Dead Sea.12:3 Rasmussen, p. 229\.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> and his territory went south to the town of Beth\-jeshimoth

Some English versions spell this name as two separate words:

> Beth Jeshimoth (NIV, NET, GNT)

#### 12:3d

**and southward below the slopes of Pisgah.**

* and on to the slopes of Mount Pisgah in the south.
* and on south to the foot of Pisgah Mountain.

**southward below the slopes of Pisgah:** Mount Pisgah was the southern boundary of King Sihon’s territory. The exact location of Mount Pisgah is uncertain, but it is probably at the north end of the Dead Sea.12:3 Rasmussen, p. 248\.

##### **General Comment on 12:3**

Here is another way to translate 12:3\. This example includes some connecting words to make the meaning clear.

> Sihon also controlled the Jordan Valley and regions to the east—from as far north as the Sea of Galilee to as far south as the Dead Sea, including the road to Beth\-jeshimoth and southward to the slopes of Pisgah. (NLT)

**And Og king of Bashan,**

* Og king of Bashan
* The second king that the Israelites defeated was King Og, king of Bashan Country,

**And Og king of Bashan:** King Og was the second king that the Israelites defeated. The story of how Moses and the Israelites defeated *Og king of Bashan* is found in Numbers 21:33–35\.

*Bashan* is a country northeast of the Sea of Galilee. This country appeared in Joshua 9:10 and you should translate it the same way in both places.

Verse 4 is part of the long Hebrew sentence that begins at 12:1\. In some languages it may be more natural to begin a new sentence here.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> They also defeated King Og of Bashan (GNT)

> Next, Moses and the Israelites defeated King Og of Bashan (CEV)

#### 12:4b

**one of the remnant of the Rephaim,**

* was among the last group of the Rephaim.
* He was one of the last of the Repha people.

**one of the remnant of the Rephaim:** The word *one* introduces a relative clause. Use the relative clause marker that is most natural in your language. It is also possible to translate this relative clause as an independent sentence.

Here are some other ways to translate this relative clause:

> who was one of the remnant of the Rephaim

> King Og was one of the last of the Repha people

**remnant:** The word *remnant* indicates that only a few of the Rephaim were still alive.

Here are some other ways to translate this word:

> one of the few remaining Rephaites (NET)

> one of the last of the Rephaites (NIV)

> among the last group of the Repha people

**the Rephaim:** The term *Rephaim* indicates a group of people who lived in the land of Canaan before the Israelites. They are mentioned in Deuteronomy 2:10–11, where it is said that they are strong and tall.

**and Edrei:** King Og also had a residence in the town of *Edrei*. Edrei was sixty miles south of Damascus.12:4 Rasmussen, p. 233\. The king was living there when the Israelites defeated him.

Here is another way to spell the name of Edrei:

> Edre\-i (RSV)

Here are some other ways to translate these phrases:

> Og king of Bashan was one of the last of the Rephaites. He ruled the land in Ashtaroth and Edrei (NCV)

**Salecah:** The town of *Salecah* was on the eastern boundary of the territory of Bashan. It was southeast of the Sea of Galilee.12:5 Rasmussen, p. 250\.

Here are some ways to translate this part of the verse:

**all of Bashan up to the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites,**

* and all of Bashan to where the Geshurites and the Maacathites lived.
* and included the land of Bashan as far west as the land of the Geshur people and the Maacah people.

**all of Bashan up to the border of the Geshurites:** The term *Geshurites* can also be translated “Geshur people.” They were a small group who lived northeast of the Sea of Galilee. Joshua and the Israelites were not able to conquer them.12:5 Rasmussen, p. 236\.

**and Maacathites:** The term *Maacathites* can also be translated “Maacah people.” This was a small kingdom in modern Syria whose people continued to live in their land. Joshua and the Israelites failed to drive them out.12:5 Rasmussen, p. 243\.

#### 12:5c

**Moses, the servant of the LORD, and the Israelites had struck them down**

* Moses the servant of Yahweh and the Israelites destroyed the people of King Sihon and King Og
* These were the people that Moses, Yahweh’s servant, and the people of Israel defeated.

Verse 6 is a summary of how Moses and the Israelite army conquered the land east of the Jordan River and divided it among Reuben, Gad and half of Manasseh.

**Moses, the servant of the LORD:** You should translate the phrase *the servant of the LORD* the same way you did in Joshua 1:1\.

**and the Israelites:** The word *Israelites* indicates the Israelite army.

**had struck them down:** The pronoun *them* refers to King Sihon and King Og. It may be helpful to make this reference explicit. For example:

> Moses, the servant of the Lord, had destroyed the people of King Sihon and King Og. (NLT)

#### 12:6b

**and given their land as an inheritance**

* and gave away all their land
* He gave their land

In the Hebrew text, the phrase “Moses, the servant of the LORD” is repeated here to emphasize the status of Moses as the one who led the Israelites out of Egypt. In some languages, it may be natural to repeat this phrase, as the Hebrew text does.

**and given their land as an inheritance:** The clause *given their land as an inheritance* indicates that Moses divided the land on the east side of the Jordan River between the two and a half tribes, who became the owners of it.

**to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half\-tribe of Manasseh.**

* to the clans of Reuben, Gad, and half the clan of Manasseh for them to own.
* to the clans of Reuben and Gad and East Manasseh as their own.

**to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half\-tribe of Manasseh:** The phrase *the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half\-tribe of Manasseh* indicates the descendants of Reuben, the descendants of Gad, and the descendants of Makir, who was a son of Manasseh. The people of Reuben and Gad asked to settle east of the Jordan River because it was good land for shepherding herds and flocks. This story is told in Numbers 32:1–5\. The descendants of Makir, from the tribe of Manasseh, conquered the land of Gilead and settled there in Numbers 32:39–40\).

**the half\-tribe of Manasseh:** Some English versions translate this as East Manasseh, because these people lived on the east side of the Jordan River.

### Section 12:1–24 The kings that Joshua and the Israelites defeated

In this section there is a list of the kings that the Israelites defeated on the east side and the west side of the Jordan River.

Here is another possible section heading:

> The kings that the Israelites defeated on both sides of the Jordan River

### Paragraph 12:7–24

The kings that the Israelites defeated on the west side of the Jordan River.

#### 12:7a

**And these are the kings of the land that Joshua and the Israelites conquered beyond the Jordan to the west,**

* ¶ This is a list of the kings that Joshua and the Israelites defeated west of the Jordan River,
* ¶ Joshua and the Israelite army also defeated the kings on the west side of the Jordan River.

**And:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *And* indicates the next event in the narrative. Some English versions do not translate this word.

**these are the kings of the land:** The clause *these are the kings of the land* introduces the list of kings whom Joshua and the Israelites defeated on the west side of the Jordan River. However, the actual list does not start until verse 9\.

**that Joshua and the Israelites conquered beyond the Jordan to the west:** Here are some other ways to translate this sentence:

> Joshua and the people of Israel defeated all the kings in the territory west of the Jordan (GNT)

> Joshua and the Israelites also defeated kings in the land west of the Jordan River. (NCV)

> The following is a list of the kings that Joshua and the Israelite armies defeated on the west side of the Jordan (NLT)

#### 12:7b

**from Baal\-gad in the Valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir**

* from Baal\-gad in the valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak which is near Seir.
* This land went from Baal\-gad in the Lebanon Valley in the north, to Halak Mountain near Edom in the south.

**from Baal\-gad in the Valley of Lebanon:** The term *Baal\-gad* indicates a town in the valley of Lebanon at the western foot of Mount Hermon.12:7 Rasmussen, p. 228\. The exact location of Baal\-gad is unknown, but it was the northern point of Joshua’s conquests.12:7 Howard, p. 272\.

Some English versions spell this name as two words:

> Baal Gad (NIV, NET, GW)

**the Valley of Lebanon:** The *Valley of Lebanon* was near Mount Hermon. It may be the modern Beqa Valley. It may also include the valley of the Litani River further south.12:7 Hess, p. 216\. This term occurred in 11:17 and you should translate it the same way as you did there.

**to Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir:** The term *Mount Halak* indicates a mountain that marked the southern point of the Israelites’ conquests. Its location is uncertain, but it may be Jebel Halaq, 28 miles southeast of Beersheba.12:7 Rasmussen, p. 237\.

**rises toward Seir:** *Seir* is another word for the territory of Edom, which was south of the Dead Sea. The clause *rises toward Seir* indicates that Mount Halak was near the territory of Edom.12:7 Bratcher and Newman, p. 166\.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> Mount Halak near the country of Edom (CEV)

##### **General Comment on 12:7b**

Verse 12:7b describes the land by naming its northern and southern points. In 12:8a\-b the same land is described by naming its geographical regions. 12:8c describes this land again by naming the Canaanite peoples who lived there.

#### 12:7c

**(according to the allotments to the tribes of Israel, Joshua gave them as an inheritance**

* Joshua gave this land to the clans of Israel for them to own, giving some to each clan,
* Joshua divided this land among the clans and gave it to them as their own.

**according to the allotments to the tribes of Israel, Joshua gave them as an inheritance:** The BSB puts verse 12:7d\-12:8c in parentheses. Most English versions do not use parentheses here.

**according to the allotments to the tribes of Israel:** Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> according to their tribal divisions (NIV)

**Joshua gave them as an inheritance:** These words are like the words in 12:6 and you should translate them in the same way. Joshua gave land to each of the ten\- and one\-half tribes of Israel who settled on the west side of the Jordan River. These tribes became owners of that land.

#### 12:8a

**the hill country, the foothills, the Arabah,**

* including the mountains, the lowlands to the west, the Jordan Valley,
* This land included the central mountains, the western foothills of the central mountains, the valley of the Jordan River,

Verse 12:8a\-b lists all the geographical areas of Israel on the west side of the Jordan River.

**the hill country:** The phrase *the hill country* indicates the central mountain range on the west side of the Jordan River. This word was used in 9:1 and you should translate it the same way in both places.

**the foothills:** The phrase *the foothills* refers to the western side of the central mountain range, between the mountains and the coastal plain. This word was used in 9:1 and you should translate it the same way in both places.

**the Arabah:** The term *Arabah* refers to the valley of the Jordan River. This word was used in 8:14 and you should translate it the same way in both places.

#### 12:8b

**the slopes, the wilderness, and the Negev—**

* the mountain slopes, the Judean wilderness, and the Negev.
* the eastern slopes of the central mountains, the desert of Judea, and the desert in southern Canaan.

**the slopes:** The phrase *the slopes* refers to the steep slopes that go down from the hill country eastward to the Dead Sea. This word was used in 10:40 and you should translate it the same way in both places.

**the wilderness:** The term *wilderness* indicates the wilderness of Judah. This is a deserted area that lies between the Judean hill country and the Dead Sea.12:8 Aharoni, p. 41\.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> the Judean wilderness (NLT)

**and the Negev:** The word *Negev* indicates the southern wilderness area. This word was used in 10:40 and you should translate it the same way in both places.

##### **General Comment on 12:7b\-8c**

Verse 12:7b described the land of Israel by naming its northern and southern points. In 12:8a\-b the same land is described again by naming its geographical regions. 12:8c describes this land a third time by naming the Canaanite peoples who lived there.

#### 12:8c

**the lands of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites):**

* This is the land that belonged to the Heth people, the Amor people, the Canaan people, the Periz people, the Hiv people, and the Jebus people.
* This was the land where the Hitti people, the Amor people, the Canaan people, the Periz people, the Hiw people, and the Yabus people used to live.

**the lands of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites:** These are names of peoples who lived in the land of Israel before the Israelites conquered the land. These names occurred in 3:10, but in a different order.

Here is another way to translate this list of peoples:

> The people who lived in this region were the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. These are the kings Israel defeated: (NLT)

##### **General Comment on 12:9–24**

Verses 12:9–24 is a list of the kings that the Israelites defeated. The BSB translates the words literally according to the Hebrew text. In some languages this may not be natural.

You should translate this list in a way that your language naturally arranges a list. It may be clearer to begin the list with an introduction stating that these are the kings the Israelites defeated. This information was in verse 12:7a and the readers may not make the connection. You can include this introduction at the end of verse 8, as NLT and NCV have done, or at the beginning of verse 9, as GNT has done.

These notes on verses 9–24 include only issues which need explanation.

* The people of Israel defeated the kings of the following cities: Jericho City, Ai City (near Bethel City),

**the king of Jericho, one:** The word *one* indicates that there was one king of Jericho. This is a literal translation of the Hebrew word. Most English versions do not include the word *one*. You should translate this list in a way that your language naturally arranges a list.

**the king of Ai, which is near Bethel, one:** The phrase *near Bethel* indicates that the town of Ai was near the town of Bethel.

Here are two different ways to translate verses 9–24:

> **9** The people of Israel defeated the kings of the following cities: Jericho, Ai (near Bethel), **10** Jerusalem, Hebron, **11** Jarmuth, Lachish, **12** Eglon, Gezer, **13** Debir, Geder, **14** Hormah, Arad, **15** Libnah, Adullam, **16** Makkedah, Bethel, **17** Tappuah, Hepher, **18** Aphek, Lasharon, **19** Madon, Hazor, **20** Shimron Meron, Achshaph, **21** Taanach, Megiddo, **22** Kedesh, Jokneam (in Carmel), **23** Dor (on the coast), Goiim (in Galilee), **24** and Tirzah—thirty\-one kings in all.

* the king of Kedesh, the king of Jokneam in Carmel,
* Kedesh City, Jokneam City near Carmel Mountain,

**Jokneam in Carmel:** The phrase *in Carmel* indicates that the town of *Jokneam* mentioned here was at the northern border of the territory of the tribe of Manasseh, near Mount Carmel. There was another town named Jokneam that was in the territory of the tribe of Ephraim.12:22 Boling and Wright, p. 329\.

#### 12:23

**the king of Dor in Naphath\-dor, one; the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one;**

* the king of Dor City in Naphath\-dor, the king of Goiim in Galilee,
* Dor City in Naphath\-dor, Goiim City (in the Galilee Region),

**Dor in Naphath\-dor:** The town of Dor was a seaport on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea south of Carmel. It is not clear what the Hebrew word “Naphath” refers to. This word appeared in 11:2 in a similar context. It is recommended that you translate this place name in agreement with the major language version in your area.

English versions differ in how they translate the word *Naphath\-dor*. Here are some other ways to translate the name of this town:

> Dor – near Naphath Dor (NET)

> Dor (in Naphath Dor) (NIV)

> Dor in the heights of Dor (NASB)

> Dor in the district of Dor (NJPS)

> Dor (on the coast) (GNT)

> Dor in the coast of Dor (KJV)

**the king of Goiim:** The Hebrew word that the BSB transliterates as *Goiim* means “nations.” For example:

> the king of the nations in Galilee (NJB)

Most English versions transliterate this word, as the BSB does. It is recommended that you transliterate it as the BSB does.

**in Gilgal:** There is a textual issue with the term *Gilgal*.

1. The ancient Greek translation, the Septuagint, has the name Galilee. *(RSV, ESV, NJB, REB, GNT, CEV)*
2. The Hebrew text has the name Gilgal. *(BSB, NIV, NET, NCV, NJPS, NLT, GW, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\) and translate this word as “Galilee” or “Galilee Region.” There is no evidence that there was a place called Gilgal in this area.12:23 Hess, p. 228; Woudstra, p. 206\.

### Section 13:1–33 Moses had distributed the land east of the Jordan River

Before Moses died he had given land to the tribes of Reuben, Gad and the half\-tribe of Manasseh. In this section Yahweh reminded Joshua of the land that they still had not conquered. Then there is a detailed listing of the boundaries of the lands on the east side of the Jordan River.

Here is another possible section heading:

> The land east of the Jordan River

#### 13:1a

**Now Joshua was old and well along in years,**

* ¶ Joshua was very old,
* ¶ Joshua was old and had lived for many years.

**Now:** The word *Now* indicates that a new section of the narrative is beginning in this verse. It does not refer to a specific time.

Here are some other ways to translate this connection:

> When Joshua was very old (NCV)

> Many years later (CEV)

There may be a particle or grammatical marker in your language to indicate that a significant time had passed between the events of the previous chapter and chapter 13\.

**Joshua was old and well along in years:** The Hebrew idiom that the BSB translates as *well along in years* is more literally “he had come in days.” This idiom means that Joshua was very old. If there is an idiom for great age in your language, you can use it. Or you can say:

> Joshua was very old

#### 13:1b

**and the LORD said to him,**

* and Yahweh said to him:
* Then Yahweh told him:

**and the LORD said to him:** The clause *the LORD said to him* may be restructured according to how you have translated the first part of verse one. For example:

> When Joshua was very old, the Lord said to him (NCV)

> Joshua was old, near the end of his life. So the Lord said to him (GW)

#### 13:1c

**“You are old and well along in years,**

* “You are very old,
* “You are old and have lived for many years.

**You are old and well along in years:** The clause *You are old and well along in years* contains the same words as 13:1a. It indicates that Joshua was very old. If it is not natural to restate this information, it maybe left implicit in the first part of the verse, for example,

> Many years later, the Lord told Joshua, “Now you are very old,” (CEV)

#### 13:1d

**but very much of the land remains to be possessed.**

* and there is still much land left to be conquered.
* There is a lot of land left for you to take.

**but:** In some languages it may be more natural to begin a new sentence rather than use the conjunction *but*.

**very much of the land remains to be possessed:** The clause *very much of the land remains to be possessed* indicates that there was still a lot of land that the Israelites had not conquered. In some languages it may be more natural to translate this clause in an active voice, for example:

> There is still much land for you to take (NCV)

> There is still a lot of land that the Israelites must conquer

#### 13:2–6

These verses are a list of all the towns and regions that the Israelites had not yet conquered. Use a format that is appropriate to list place names in your language. Verse 2a introduces the list.

#### 13:2a

**This is the land that remains:**

* These are the places that you still must conquer:
* This is the territory that remains for you to take:

**This is the land that remains:** The phrase *the land that remains* indicates the places in Canaan that Israel has not yet conquered. It may be helpful to include some implicit information. For example:

> This is the land that has not yet been conquered

#### 13:2b

**All the territory of the Philistines and the Geshurites,**

* all the land where the Philistines and the Geshurites live.
* all the districts that belong to the Filisti people and the Geshur people.

**All the territory of the Philistines:** The *territory of the Philistines* were on the coastal plain of the Mediterranean Sea in the southwestern part of Canaan.

**Philistines:** The *Philistines* indicates a group of people who lived in several large towns near the Mediterranean Sea.

Here is another way to translate this word:

> Filisti people

The Philistines are mentioned several times in Genesis. If you have already translated Genesis, you should translate this name the same way you did there. See, for example, Genesis 10:14\.

**and the Geshurites:** The phrase *the Geshurites* indicates the land where the Geshur people lived. The Geshur people were mentioned in Joshua 12:5 and you should translate the term the same way in both places.

Here is another possible section heading:

> The land east of the Jordan River

#### 13:3a\-d

The BSB adds parentheses around part of this section to make it clear that this is a description of the “territory of the Philistines and the Geshurites.” These parentheses are not in the Hebrew text. You may find that parentheses are helpful, or there may be some other way to connect verses 3a\-d to verse 2\.

#### 13:3a

**from the Shihor east of Egypt to the territory of Ekron on the north**

* Their land extends from the Shihor Canal which is east of Egypt, and north as far as the border of Ekron,
* That area goes south to the Shihor Canal at the east border of Egypt, and it goes north to Ekron City.

**from the Shihor east of Egypt:** The term *Shihor* indicates a canal of the Nile River in the eastern delta of Egypt, near the present\-day Suez Canal. The Shihor Canal was on the east side of Egypt, and it was the south boundary of the Philistine and Geshurite region.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> The Philistine and Geshurite region goes south to the Shihor Canal which is east of Egypt

**to the territory of Ekron on the north:** The phrase *to the territory of Ekron on the north* indicates that Ekron was the north boundary of the Philistine and Geshurite region. Ekron was a town of the Philistine people and is mentioned in 13:3d.

#### 13:3b

**(considered to be Canaanite territory)—**

* which is considered to be Canaanite territory.
* All that area formerly belonged to the Canaan people.

**considered to be Canaanite territory:** The clause *considered to be Canaanite territory* indicates that Ekron was considered to be part of Canaan because the Philistines took it from the original Canaanite settlers.13:3 Woudstra, p. 210\.

#### 13:3c

**that of the five Philistine rulers**

* There are five Philistine rulers,
* There are five kings of Filisti people who rule in these five cities:

**that of the five Philistine rulers:** The clause *that of the five Philistine rulers* indicates that each Philistine town had its own ruler. The towns are listed in the next part of the verse.

#### 13:3d

**of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron,**

* of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron.
* Gaza City, Ashdod City, Ashkelon City, Gath City, and Ekron City.

**of Gaza:** The name *Gaza* refers to a Philistine town in southwest Canaan, near the Mediterranean Sea.

**Ashdod:** The name *Ashdod* indicates a Philistine town 22 miles south of Joppa on the Mediterranean Sea.

**Ashkelon:** The name *Ashkelon* indicates a Philistine town on the Mediterranean Sea 32 miles south of Joppa.

**Gath:** The name *Gath* indicates a Philistine town 25 miles southeast of the town of Joppa. In later times King David fought against Goliath, who came from Gath.

**and Ekron:** The name *Ekron* indicates a Philistine town 20 miles southeast of Joppa.

#### 13:3e

**as well as that of the Avvites;**

* There is also the land where the Avvim people live
* The district of the Avvim people

**as well as that of the Avvites:** The phrase *that of the Avvites* indicates that the Israelites must also conquer the region where the Avvim people lived. This is a third region that is mentioned, and it is parallel to the “territory of the Philistines” and the “territory of the Geshurites” (13:2b). In some languages it may be clearer to start a new sentence here.

**Avvites:** The *Avvites* are mentioned in Deuteronomy 2:23\. They lived in villages near Gaza.13:3 Boling and Wright, p. 338\.

Here are some other ways to translate the word Avvites:

> Avvim (NRSV)

> Avvim people

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> There is also the region of the Avvim people in the south that has not been conquered

#### 13:4a

**to the south,**

* in the south.
* in the south has not been conquered.

**to the south:** The Avvim lived in the south of the Philistine territory. This prepositional phrase describes the Avvim people and is a continuation of verse 3e. You should translate it as a single phrase.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> The region of the Avvim people in the south has also not been conquered

#### 13:4b

**all the land of the Canaanites,**

* There is also all the land of the Canaanites,
* There are also the districts of all the Canaan people,

**all the land of the Canaanites:** The phrase *the land of the Canaanites* introduces a second group of towns. These are places in the north that are named in verses 4–6\.13:4 Woudstra, p. 211\.

For example:

> In the north, the following area has not yet been conquered: all the land of the Canaanites, including Mearah (which belongs to the Sidonians) stretching northward to Aphek on the border of the Amorites. (NLT)

The term “Canaanite” is used here as a term for the inhabitants of Canaan. This is different from how it is used in verse 13:3b, where it refers to a specific group of Canaan people.

#### 13:4c

**from Mearah of the Sidonians**

* from Mearah City which belongs to the Sidonians,
* including Mearah City which belongs to the Sidonian people

**from Mearah:** There is a textual issue in this verse.

1. The Hebrew text says *Mearah*. We do not know where the town of Mearah was. *(BSB, RSV, ESV, NJB, NABRE, NJPS, GW, NLT, GNT, KJV)*
2. Some scholars suggest that we should divide the word *Mearah* and modify the vowels so that it becomes two Hebrew words “from Arah.” The town of Arah is also unknown. *(NIV, NET, CEV)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\) along with the Hebrew text.

**of the Sidonians:** The clause *of the Sidonians* indicates that town of Mearah was ruled by the people of Sidon. Sidon was on the Mediterranean coast in the north.

#### 13:4d

**to Aphek, as far as the border of the Amorites;**

* and on to Aphek, on the Amorite border.
* and going north to Aphek City on the border of the Amor people.

**to Aphek:** The term *Aphek* indicates a town that was probably southeast of Byblos in Lebanon.13:4 Rasmussen p. 226\.

**as far as the border of the Amorites:** The phrase *as far as the border of the Amorites* indicates that “Aphek” was on the northern border of the land that was ruled by the Amorite people. The next people further north from there were the Amorite people.

**the land of the Gebalites:** It may be more natural to begin a new sentence at the beginning of verse 5, for example:

> It also includes the land of the Gebal people

**the Gebalites:** The term *Gebalites* indicates the people who lived in Gebal, a town on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, eighteen miles northeast of modern Beirut.13:5 Rasmussen, p. 235\. The ancient Greek name of this town was Byblos, and some English versions (NIV11, NET) refer to it by this name. The modern Arabic name for this town is Jubayl.

#### 13:5b

**and all Lebanon to the east,**

* and all of Lebanon eastward
* all of Lebanon to the east,

**and all Lebanon to the east:** The phrase *all Lebanon to the east* indicates that the rest of Lebanon east of Gebal must still be conquered.

The places named in 13:5c describe the southern and northern limits of *all Lebanon*.

#### 13:5c

**from Baal\-gad below Mount Hermon to Lebo\-hamath.**

* from Baal\-gad at the foot of Mount Hermon to the entrance into Hamath City,
* from Baal\-gad at the base of Mount Hermon in the south, to Hamath Mountain Pass in the north.

**from Baal\-gad below Mount Hermon:** The town of *Baal\-gad* was mentioned in Joshua 11:17\. It was in the Lebanon Valley at the western foot of Hermon Mountain. Baal\-gad was at the southern point Lebanon Valley.

Here is another way to spell the word Baal\-gad:

> Baal Gad (NIV, NET)

**below Mount Hermon:** The phrase *below Mount Hermon* indicates that the town of Baal\-gad was at the base of Hermon Mountain.

**to Lebo\-hamath:** There are two ways to interpret the phrase *Lebo\-hamath*.

1. The Hebrew text reads *lebo hamath*. The Hebrew word *lebo* means “entrance.” Some English versions translate this as the entrance of Hamath or the Hamath Mountain Pass. For example:

    > the border of Hamath (GW) *(GW, RSV, NJB, GNT, CEV, KJV)*

2. Some English versions translate this as a proper name, Lebo Hamath. For example:

    > Lebo Hamath (NIV) *(BSB, NIV, ESV, NCV, NLT, NET, NJPS, REB)*

It is difficult to know which is the proper interpretation. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\) unless the national version used in your area uses interpretation (2\).

**Lebo\-hamath:** The town of *Lebo\-hamath* and its mountain pass occurs several times in the Bible in boundary lists. See, for example, Numbers 13:21 and Judges 3:3\. Hamath town was the northern point of the Lebanon Valley.

## Joshua 13:6 (id: 516370)

### Section 13:1–33 Moses had distributed the land east of the Jordan River

Before Moses died he had given land to the tribes of Reuben, Gad and the half\-tribe of Manasseh. In this section Yahweh reminded Joshua of the land that they still had not conquered. Then there is a detailed listing of the boundaries of the lands on the east side of the Jordan River.

Here is another possible section heading:

> The land east of the Jordan River

#### 13:6a

**All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth\-maim—**

* and all the inhabitants of the mountain region from Lebanon to Misrephoth\-maim,
* There are also all the people who live in the mountain range that runs from Lebanon to Misrephoth\-maim,

**All the inhabitants of the hill country:** The phrase *the inhabitants of the hill country* indicates the people who lived in the mountain range that runs from north to south in Lebanon, away from the coastal plain.

**from Lebanon to Misrephoth\-maim:** The phrase *from Lebanon to Misrephoth\-maim* indicates that the mountain range extended from the north part of the country of Lebanon south to the town of *Misrephoth\-maim*.

**Misrephoth\-maim:** The location of the town of *Misrephoth\-maim* is uncertain. It was probably north of Galilee and not far from Sidon, near the Litani River.13:6 Rasmussen, p. 245\.

Here is another way to spell Misrephoth\-maim:

> Misrephoth Maim (NIV, NET)

#### 13:6b

**all the Sidonians—**

* that is, all the Sidonians.
* who are under the rule of Sidon City.

**all the Sidonians:** The phrase *the Sidonians* indicates that the people who lived in the mountain range of Lebanon were *Sidonians*. This region was governed by Sidon. The town of Sidon was twenty\-four miles southwest of Beirut on the Lebanese coast.

In some languages it may be more natural to reorder verses 6a and 6b. For example:

> This includes all the territory of the Sidonians, who live in the hill country between the Lebanon Mountains and Misrephoth Maim (GNT)

#### 13:6c

**I Myself will drive out before the Israelites.**

* I am the one who will drive them out before the Israelites.
* It is I who will drive the people mentioned above out of the land ahead of the Israelites.

**I Myself will drive out:** The Hebrew pronoun that the BSB translates as *Myself* emphasizes that Yahweh is the one who will give the Israelites victory. Use the most natural way in your language to show this emphasis.

**before the Israelites:** The phrase *before the Israelites* indicates that God will give the Israelites victory as they move forward to conquer the land.

#### 13:6d

**Be sure to divide it by lot as an inheritance to Israel,**

* Be sure to give this land to Israel as an inheritance,
* However, Joshua, you must distribute the land to Israel for them to own,

**Be sure to:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Be sure to* introduces a command. It contrasts what is Joshua’s responsibility with what Yahweh would do for the Israelites.

Here are some other ways that English versions emphasize this command:

> So be sure to give this land to Israel as a special possession (NLT)

> All you have to do is to distribute the territory as a heritage for the Israelites as I have commanded you (NJB)

**divide it by lot as an inheritance to Israel:** The clause *divide it by lot as an inheritance to Israel* indicates that Joshua must divide the land among the tribes of Israel who would live on the west side of the Jordan River.

**as an inheritance:** The phrase *as an inheritance* indicates that the Israelites received the land of Canaan as a gift from Yahweh to them. It would then belong to them and their descendants forever if they obeyed Yahweh. The word “inheritance” was used in 11:23, and you should translate it the same way in both places.

#### 13:6e

**as I have commanded you.**

* as I have told you.
* as I commanded you.

**as I have commanded you:** Yahweh gave this command to Moses in Numbers 33:54\. Moses told Joshua to carry out this command in Deuteronomy 31:7\.

Here is another possible section heading:

> The land east of the Jordan River

#### 13:7a

**Now therefore divide this land as an inheritance**

* Now, divide up this land as an inheritance
* So, divide this land

**Now therefore:** The Hebrew words that the BSB translates as *Now therefore* are literally “and now.” The word *Now* indicates that the time has arrived for Joshua to divide the land between the Israelite tribes. Use a joining word that is natural to connect this clause with the preceding clause.

**divide this land as an inheritance:** The clause *divide this land as an inheritance* has the same meaning as the command in 13:6d. It is repeated for emphasis, using different words.

#### 13:7b

**to the nine tribes and the half\-tribe of Manasseh.”**

* for the nine clans and the half\-clan of Manasseh.”
* for the nine clans and half the clan of Manasseh to own.”

**to the nine tribes:** The phrase *to the nine tribes* indicates the nine tribes of Israel that had not yet received land. These nine tribes are Judah, Ephraim, Benjamin, Simeon, Zebulun, Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and Dan.

**and the half\-tribe of Manasseh:** The phrase *the half\-tribe of Manasseh* indicates those people of the tribe of the Manasseh who chose to live west of the Jordan River.

There is a textual issue in this verse. The Septuagint, the ancient Greek translation, includes another clause at the end of verse 13:7 which is not in the Hebrew text. Most English versions do not include this clause, but it is found in the NJB:

> from the Jordan as far as the Great Sea in the west, you must give it them; the Great Sea will be their limit (NJB)

It is recommended that you do not include this clause unless it is included in the majority language version in your area.

**The other half of Manasseh,**

* ¶ Half the clan of Manasseh
* ¶ The other half of the clan of Manasseh

**The other half of Manasseh:** The phrase *The other half of Manasseh* indicates those people from the tribe of Manasseh who chose to live on the east side of the Jordan River. This story is first told in Numbers 32\.

In some languages it may be more natural to reverse the order of 8a and 8b, for example:

> The tribes of Reuben and Gad and the other half of the tribe of Manasseh had already received their land on the east side of the Jordan River

#### 13:8b

**along with the Reubenites and Gadites, had received the inheritance**

* and the clans of Reuben and Gad received their inheritance
* and the clans of Reuben and Gad had already received their land

**along with the Reubenites and Gadites, had received the inheritance:** The terms *the Reubenites and Gadites* indicate the tribe of Reuben and the tribe of Gad.

Here is another way to translate these names:

> the tribe of Reuben and the tribe of Gad

#### 13:8c

**Moses had given them beyond the Jordan to the east,**

* which Moses gave them on the east side of the Jordan.
* on the east side of the Jordan River.

**Moses had given them beyond the Jordan to the east:** The phrase *beyond the Jordan to the east* indicates that the land Moses gave these tribes was on the east side of the Jordan River.

#### 13:8d

**just as Moses the servant of the LORD had assigned to them:**

* Moses, the servant of Yahweh, gave this land to them.
* Moses, Yahweh’s servant, gave them this land.

**just as Moses the servant of the LORD had assigned to them:** The phrase *Moses the servant of the LORD* was used in Joshua 1:1 and you should translate it the same way in both places.

Verse 8d repeats information from 8c, and some English versions combine these two phrases together. Here is another way to translate this verse:

> The tribes of Reuben and Gad and the other half of the tribe of Manasseh had already received the land that Moses, the Lord’s servant, had given them; it was on the east side of the Jordan River. (GNT)

**The area from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley,**

* Their territory extended from Aroer on the edge of the valley of the Arnon River,
* Their land started at Aroer City at the Arnon River gorge.

**The area from Aroer:** In some languages it may be more natural to add implicit information, for example:

> Their land started at Aroer (NCV)

**Aroer:** The term *Aroer* indicates a town that was along the Arnon River.

**on the rim of the Arnon Valley:** The clause *on the rim of the Arnon Valley* indicates that the town of Aroer was on the bank of the Arnon River, in the Arnon River Valley.

Here is another way to translate this clause:

> Aroer was on the bank of the Arnon River, in the valley.

**Arnon Valley:** The term *Arnon Valley* appeared in 12:1 and you should translate it the same way in both places.

#### 13:9b

**along with the city in the middle of the valley,**

* including the town that is halfway along the valley,
* It included the city that is halfway along the Arnon River gorge,

**along with the city in the middle of the valley:** The phrase *in the middle of the valley* indicates that the town was halfway along the valley. The town is not named.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> including the town that is halfway along the Arnon River Valley

#### 13:9c

**the whole plateau of Medeba as far as Dibon,**

* to the plain beyond Medeba, as far as Dibon City.
* and the whole of the Medeba Plateau to Dibon City.

**the whole plateau of Medeba:** The word *plateau* indicates a plain. The *plateau of Medeba* was a high, flat area between the Arnon River in the south and Heshbon in the north. It was 600–700 meters high.13:9 Woudstra, p. 216\.

**Medeba:** The town of *Medeba* was a Moabite town that the Israelites captured from King Sihon (see Numbers 21:21–32\). Today it is the town of Madaba in Jordan, twenty miles south of Amman.13:9 Rasmussen, p. 244\.

**as far as Dibon:** The phrase *as far as Dibon* indicates that the tableland of Medeba stretched from Medeba in the north to Dibon in the south. Dibon was one of the Moabite towns that the Israelites captured. Its name today is Dhiban and it is thirteen miles east of the Dead Sea and three miles north of the Arnon Gorge.13:9 Rasmussen, p. 244\.

* It extended to all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon,
* It included all the cities ruled by King Sihon of the Amorites, who ruled from Heshbon City,

**and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites:** The phrase *all the cities* refers to all the towns in the territory that King Sihon ruled.

**the Amorites:** The word *Amorites* can be used in two senses. It can refer to a group of people who lived in the mountainous region of Canaan. This is the way it is used here. It can also be a synonym for “Canaanite,” and refer to the whole population of Canaan.

The word *Amorites* occurred in Joshua 2:10 and you should translate it the same way in both places.

**who reigned in Heshbon:** The clause *who reigned in Heshbon* indicates that *Heshbon* was the capital town of King Sihon. Heshbon was about 25 kilometers northeast of the Dead Sea, and southwest of present\-day Amman, the capital city of Jordan.13:10 Bratcher and Newman, p. 171\.

It may be helpful to start a new sentence here. Here is another way to translate this clause:

**also Gilead:** The term *Gilead* indicates the mountainous region north of the Dead Sea. The Gilead Region stretched from the east side of the Jordan River to the desert.

The term Gilead occurred in 12:2 and you should translate it the same way in both places.

**and the territory of the Geshurites:** The term *Geshurites* indicates the people of the kingdom of Geshur. They were a small group who lived northeast of the Sea of Galilee.

The term Geshurites occurred in 12:5 and you should translate it the same way in both places.

**and Maacathites:** The term *Maacathites* indicates the people of Maacah. This was a small kingdom in modern Syria whose people continued to live in their land.

The term Maacathites occurred in 12:5 and you should translate it the same way in both places.

It may be more natural to begin a new sentence at the beginning of verse 11\. Here is another way to translate it:

**all of Mount Hermon, and all Bashan as far as Salecah—**

* and all of Mount Hermon and all of Bashan as far as Salecah.
* It included all of Mount Hermon and Bashan Region as far as Salecah City.

**all of Mount Hermon:** The phrase *all of Mount Hermon* indicates Mount Hermon and its surrounding foothills. *Mount Hermon* was a high mountain that was the northern limit of Joshua’s conquests. It was in the northeast part of Israel. It formed the northwest limit of King Og’s kingdom.

The term Mount Hermon occurred in Joshua 11:3 and you should translate it the same way in both places.

**and all Bashan:** The territory of *Bashan* stretched south to the hills of northern Gilead, where Sihon’s territory began, and west to the Sea of Galilee. The east boundary of the Bashan territory was the desert.

The term Bashan occurred in Joshua 9:10\| and you should translate it the same way in both places.

**the whole kingdom of Og in Bashan:** The phrase *the whole kingdom of Og in Bashan* indicates all the places that were named in the previous verse. It may be helpful to make this explicit. For example:

> that is, the whole kingdom of Og in Bashan (NIV)

> These previously mentioned places were all included in the land of King Og, who ruled in Bashan Territory

* King Og was the last of the Repha people,

**and had remained as a remnant of the Rephaim:** The clause *and had remained as a remnant of the Rephaim* is placed in parentheses in some English versions to indicate that the translators consider this to be background information. There are no parentheses in the Hebrew text or the BSB.

**remnant:** The word *remnant* indicates that only a few of the Rephaim were still alive.

* However, the Israelites did not make the Geshur people and the Maacah people leave,

**but:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *but* contrasts what follows with the information in 13:11a. Yahweh told the Israelites to conquer the land of the Geshurites and Maacathites, but they did not.

Here are some other ways to translate this word:

> but (NIV, NET)

* But Moses did not give any land to the clan of Levi.

**To the tribe of Levi:** In the Hebrew text the phrase that the BSB translates as *To the tribe of Levi* is at the beginning of the sentence to show emphasis. The *tribe of Levi* was the only tribe that did not receive land as their gift from Yahweh.

In some languages it may not be natural to begin a sentence with this phrase. Use a natural way in your language to emphasize that the tribe of Levi was different from the other tribes.

**Moses had given no inheritance:** The clause *Moses had given no inheritance* indicates that Moses did not assign any land to the tribe of Levi.

#### 13:14b

**The offerings made by fire to the LORD, the God of Israel, are their inheritance,**

* The sacrifices burned on the altar to Yahweh God of Israel are what the Levites inherited,
* Instead, he gave them the burned sacrifices that were offered to Yahweh, the God of Israel,

**The offerings made by fire to the LORD, the God of Israel, are their inheritance:** The phrase *offerings made by fire* refers to sacrifices that were partially burned. In Numbers 18:21–32\| Yahweh told Aaron that the Levites could eat some of these offerings.

There is a textual issue in this verse:

1. The Hebrew text includes the words *offerings made by fire*. For example:

    > To the tribe of Levi alone Moses gave no inheritance. The offerings by fire to the Lord God of Israel are their inheritance (ESV) *(BSB, ESV, RSV, NIV84, NET, GW, NJPS, NLT, GNT, CEV, KJV)*

2. The Septuagint, the ancient Greek translation, does not include the words *offerings made by fire*. For example:

    > To the tribe of Levi alone no heritage was given; Yahweh, God of Israel, was his heritage (NJB) *(NJB, NEB, REB, NABRE)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\) and the Hebrew text.

**offerings made by fire:** There are two ways to interpret the phrase *offerings made by fire*:

1. It means offerings that are burned. For example:

    > the sacrifices burned on the altar to the Lord God of Israel (GNT) *(BSB, GNT, RSV, NET, ESV, NIV84, GW, NJPS, NLT, KJV)*

2. It means food offerings. For example:

    > the food offerings presented to the Lord, the God of Israel (NIV11\) *(NIV11\)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). This agrees with most English versions and the Hebrew lexicons.

Here is another way to translate the phrase *offerings made by fire*:

> offerings burned on the altar (NLT)

**are their inheritance:** The phrase *their inheritance* indicates that God gave the tribe of Levi the offerings of the Israelites instead of land.

#### 13:14c

**just as He had promised them.**

* as Yahweh said to Moses.
* as Yahweh told Moses and the Israelites.

**just as He had promised them:** The clause *just as He had promised them* indicates that Yahweh told this to Moses. This is recorded in Deuteronomy 18:1–2\.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> as the Lord had told Moses (GNT)

**them:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *them* is singular. Some English versions, such as the BSB, NIV, and KJV, observe that God spoke to all the Israelites as well as to Moses, and so they translate this word as *them*.

**This is what Moses had given to the clans of the tribe of Reuben:**

* ¶ Moses gave land to the clan of Reuben for each sub\-clan.

This verse begins with a Hebrew word that is often translated as “and.” This word introduces the next event in the story. Many English versions do not translate this word.

**This is what Moses had given to the clans of the tribe of Reuben:** The Hebrew text is more literally “Moses gave to the tribe of the sons of Reuben.” The phrase *This is what* is not in the Hebrew text. The BSB has supplied this phrase to make clear what Moses gave to the tribe of Reuben. Moses assigned land to the tribe of Reuben in Numbers 32\.

**to the clans:** The phrase *to the clans* indicates that each clan or group of families within the tribe of Reuben received their own portion of land. See how you translated the words “clan” and “family” in Joshua 7:14\.

Here are some other ways to translate this verse:

> Moses had given each family group from the tribe of Reuben some land. (NCV)

**who reigned in Heshbon:** The clause *who reigned in Heshbon* indicates that *Heshbon* was the capital city of King Sihon. Heshbon was mentioned in 13:10 and 13:17, and you should translate it the same way every time.

**until Moses killed him and the chiefs of Midian:** Moses defeated King Sihon along with all the other leaders of Midian. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. For example:

> Moses had defeated him along with the Midianites including Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba (NCV)

**chiefs of Midian:** *Midian* was one of the sons of Abraham and Keturah (Genesis 25:1–2\). Midian’s descendants became a group called Midian. They were a nomadic people who lived in northwest Arabia, east of the Gulf of Aqaba.13:21 Rasmussen p. 245\.

**The Israelites also killed the diviner Balaam son of Beor**

* The Israelites killed Balaam, son of Beor, who cast lots to predict the future,
* The Israelite soldiers also killed Balaam, the son of Beor, who used magic to tell the future,

**The Israelites also killed:** In some languages it is more natural to restructure verse 22 so that it begins with the subject, *The Israelites*. The term *The Israelites* indicates the Israelite soldiers. The Israelites soldiers killed Balaam.

**also:** The word *also* is not in the Hebrew text. It is added in the BSB to show that Balaam is a new topic. Choose the word order or lexical means that is most natural in your language to do this.

**the diviner Balaam son of Beor:** In this verse *the diviner Balaam son of Beor* is the object of the verb. In Hebrew the object is sometimes put at the beginning of the sentence to show emphasis.

**the diviner:** The word *diviner* indicates a person who predicted the future by casting lots. The lots were probably small stones. The word *diviner* refers to Balaam, not to Beor his father.

Here are some other ways to translate this word:

> the one who practiced divination (ESV

> The Israelites killed many people during the fighting, including Balaam, son of Beor, who tried to use magic to tell the future (NCV)

**they put to the sword:** The phrase that the BSB translates as *they put to the sword* is a Hebrew idiom. It indicates that they killed these people.

**The territory of Jazer, all the cities of Gilead,**

* Their territory included Jazer City, all the cities of Gilead Region,
* Their land included Jazer City, all the cities in the southern part of Gilead Region,

**The territory of Jazer:** The term *Jazer* indicates a town east of the Jordan River. Jazer was part of the kingdom of King Sihon. Its location is uncertain.

**all the cities of Gilead:** The phrase *cities of Gilead* indicates the towns in the region of *Gilead* that were near to Jazer. This was the southern part of Gilead. In verse 13:31 it says that the northern part of Gilead was assigned to the half\-tribe of Manasseh.

The name Gilead appeared in Joshua 12:2 and you should translate it the same way in both places.

#### 13:25b

* to Aroer City, which is near Rabbah City.
* as far as Aroer City close to Rabbah City.

**as far as Aroer, near Rabbah:** The term *Aroer* indicates a town that was part of the kingdom of King Sihon. The town named *Aroer* in this verse is not the same as the Aroer mentioned in verse 16 which was assigned to Reuben. The location of the Aroer in this verse is not known.

**near:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *near* is more literally “on the face of.” There are three ways to interpret this word.

1. It means near. For example:

    > near Rabbah (BSB) *(BSB, NIV, NCV, NET, NJPS, GW, NJB)*

2. It means east. For example:

    > east of Rabbah (GNT) *(GNT, RSV, ESV, REB)*

3. It means west. For example:

    > west of Rabbah (CEV) *(CEV, NLT)*

It is recommended that you choose interpretation (1\). We do not know for certain which direction Aroer town was in relation to Rabbah town. It is best to translate it using a word that means “near” or “close to.”

Here are some other ways that English versions translate this word:

> by (GW)

> facing (NJB)

**Rabbah:** The term *Rabbah* indicates the capital city of the Ammon people. Today it is the city of Amman, Jordan and it is 22 miles east of the Jordan River.

##### **General Comment on 13:25**

It may be more natural in some languages to translate this list of cites using more than one sentence. For example:

> Their territory included the town of Jazer and all the towns of the southern Gilead Region. It also included half the land of the Ammonites. It extended as far as Aroer, which was close to Rabbah.

* Their territory went from Heshbon to Ramath\-mizpeh and Betonim,
* The land given to the clan of Gad went from Heshbon City in the south to Ramath\-mizpeh City and Betonim City

**the territory from Heshbon to Ramath\-mizpeh and Betonim:** It is recommended that you begin a new sentence here.

**Heshbon:** The town of *Heshbon* was about 25 kilometers northeast of the Dead Sea, and southwest of Amman, Jordan.13:26 Bratcher and Newman, p. 238\. It formed the south boundary of the land of the tribe of Gad.

**Ramath\-mizpeh:** The town of *Ramath\-mizpeh* was one of the towns that the tribe of Gad inherited. The location of Ramath\-mizpeh is uncertain.

Here is another way to spell the name of this town:

* and from Mahanaim to Debir.
* and further north to Mahanaim City and Debir City.

**and from Mahanaim:** The phrase *from Mahanaim* indicates that the land of the tribe of Gad included the town of *Mahanaim*. Mahanaim was to the north, at the border between the tribes of Gad and Manasseh. Its location is uncertain.

**to the border of Debir:** There is a textual issue with the word *Debir*.

1. In the Hebrew text this word is spelled *lidber*. In 2 Samuel 9:4 there is a town called Lo\-debar. Some scholars think that the town mentioned here in Joshua is Lo\-debar. However, they have to amend the Hebrew spelling slightly to make it fit.

The town of Lo\-debar in 2 Samuel 9:4 was in the Jordan River Valley, ten miles south of the Sea of Galilee.13:26 Rasmussen, p. 232\.

Here are some ways that English versions spell this name:

> Lo\-debar (NLT, NABRE)

> Lodebar (GNT)

> Lidbir (GW, NJPS)

> Lidebor (CEV)

1. Some ancient versions of Joshua omit the letter “l” when they spell this name. They spell it *idber*. From this we get the English name Debir as in the BSB. However, there is no town known by the name of Debir east of the Jordan River.13:26 Woudstra, p. 222\. For example:

    > Debir (NIV) *(BSB, NIV, RSV, ESV, NET, NASB, KJV)*

The commentaries do not agree on this issue. It is recommended that you follow the majority language version of your area in translating this word.

**up to the edge of the Sea of Chinnereth:** The phrase *up to the edge of the Sea of Chinnereth* indicates that the territory of the tribe of Gad extended north to the southern end of the Sea of Chinnereth.

**Sea of Chinnereth:** The term *Sea of Chinnereth* is another name for the Sea of Galilee. It is recommended that you use the term “Lake Galilee” if it is more familiar to your readers. Translate this name the same way as in Joshua 11:2\.

Here is another way to translate Sea of Chinnereth:

> Sea of Galilee (NCV, CEV, NLT, GNT, GW)

The RSV spells this name “Chinneroth”. As with many of these names, you may wish to use a spelling/pronunciation that is used in a nearby or well\-known translation from your region.

### Section 13:1–33 Moses had distributed the land east of the Jordan River

Before Moses died he had given land to the tribes of Reuben, Gad and the half\-tribe of Manasseh. In this section Yahweh reminded Joshua of the land that they still had not conquered. Then there is a detailed listing of the boundaries of the lands on the east side of the Jordan River.

Here is another possible section heading:

> The land east of the Jordan River

#### 13:29a

**This is what Moses had given to the clans of the half\-tribe of Manasseh,**

* ¶ Moses gave land to half the clan of Manasseh for their people to inherit.
* ¶ Moses assigned the following land to half the clan of Manasseh.

The Hebrew word that the BSB leaves untranslated but some English versions translate as “and" indicates a transition to the next topic. Many English versions do not translate this connecting word.

**Moses had given to the clans of the half\-tribe of Manasseh:** The clause *Moses had given to the clans of the half\-tribe of Manasseh* indicates that Moses assigned land to half of the tribe of Manasseh for them to live on and pass on to their descendants. Moses mentioned this in Deuteronomy 3:13\.

**the half\-tribe of Manasseh:** The *half\-tribe of Manasseh* indicates the people who had Manasseh as their ancestor. Manasseh was the oldest son of Joseph, son of Jacob. The tribe of Manasseh received land on both the east and the west sides of the Jordan River, and so there were two “half\-tribes.” Some English versions refer to these two groups as East Manasseh and West Manasseh.

#### 13:29b

**that is, to half the tribe of the descendants of Manasseh:**

* It was given to them with some for each sub\-clan.
* He gave some to each of their sub\-clans.

**to half the tribe of the descendants of Manasseh:** The clause *to half the tribe of the descendants of Manasseh* repeats the information in 29a using different words. In some languages it may be more natural to leave this part of the clause as implicit information.

**the descendants of Manasseh:** The phrase *the descendants* indicates that each family or clan within half of the tribe of Manasseh received their own portion of the land on the east side of the Jordan River. See how you translated the word “family” in Joshua 7:14\.

* Their territory started at Mahanaim,
* Their land went north from Mahanaim City

**The territory from Mahanaim:** The town of *Mahanaim* was on the south border of the tribes of Gad and Manasseh. Its exact location is uncertain. The town of Mahanaim was mentioned in 13:26 and you should translate it the same way in both places.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> their land extended north from the town of Mahanaim

#### 13:30b

**through all Bashan—all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan,**

* and included all of Bashan, the country of King Og,
* through all of the country of Bashan, which was ruled by King Og.

**through all Bashan—all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan:** The phrase *through all Bashan* contains the same information as the next phrase, *all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan*.

Here is another way to translate this clause:

> it included the country of Bashan, which was ruled by King Og

**Bashan:** The term *Bashan* indicates a country or a region that was on a high and fertile plateau north of Gilead. The country of Bashan was mentioned in Joshua 9:10 and you should translate it the same way in both places.

#### 13:30c

**including all the towns of Jair that are in Bashan, sixty cities;**

* and all sixty of the cities which Jair of the clan of Manasseh captured in Bashan.
* It included all sixty cities in the country of Bashan which Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, captured.

**including all the towns of Jair that are in Bashan:** The phrase *all the towns of Jair that are in Bashan* indicates that the towns that Jair captured were included in the territory of Manasseh. Jair was a descendant of Manasseh. The story of how he captured these towns is found in Numbers 32:41\.

**sixty cities:** In some languages it may be more natural to include the words *sixty cities* as part of the preceding phrase. For example:

> It included all the sixty cities which Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, captured in Bashan

* It included the northern half of the region of Gilead, as well as Ashtaroth City and Edre\-i City, the capital cities of King Og who ruled the country of Bashan.

**half of Gilead:** The phrase *half of Gilead* indicates half of the region of Gilead. The other half of the Gilead region was captured from King Sihon and was mentioned in 12:2\. You should translate the term *Gilead* the same way in both places.

**and Ashtaroth and Edrei, the royal cities of Og in Bashan:** *Ashtaroth and Edrei* were two important towns in the kingdom of King Og.

In some languages it may be more natural to begin a new sentence here. Here is another way to translate this verse:

> It included half of Gilead, as well as Ashtaroth and Edrei (GNT)

**Ashtaroth:** The town of *Ashtaroth* was the capital town of King Og of Bashan. Ashtaroth was mentioned in Joshua 9:10 and you should translate it the same way in both places.

**Edrei:** King Og also had a residence where he sometimes lived in the town of *Edrei*. Edrei was mentioned in Joshua 12:4, and you should translate it the same way in both places.

#### 13:31b

**All this was for the clans of the descendants of Machir son of Manasseh,**

* These cities were given to the descendants of Machir, who was Manasseh’s son,
* Moses gave this land to the people descended from Machir the son of Manasseh.

**All this was for the clans of the descendants of Machir son of Manasseh:** The word *All this* indicates the towns that were listed in verses 13:30–31\.

**was for:** The verb phrase *was for* is not in the Hebrew text. The Hebrew text has no verb, but in English a verb must be supplied.

**the clans of the descendants:** The phrase *the clans of the descendants* indicates that each clan or group of families within half of the tribe of Manasseh that was descended from Machir received their own portion of the land on the east side of the Jordan River.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> Moses gave these towns to the people of Machir the son of Manasseh

**Machir son of Manasseh:** *Machir* was the first\-born son of Manasseh.

Here is another way to spell Machir:

> Makir (NET, NIV)

#### 13:31c

**that is, half of the descendants of Machir.**

* for the Machir side of the clan of Manasseh, with some land for each family.
* He gave it to each family descended from Machir. These families made up this half\-clan of Manasseh.

**that is, half of the descendants of Machir:** The phrase *half of the descendants of Machir* contains similar information to the phrase in verse 13:31b “the people of Machir the son of Manasseh.” In some languages it is more natural to leave one of these phrases as implicit information.

Here is another way to translate verse 13:31b\-c:

> Moses gave these towns to the families in this half\-tribe of Manasseh. These families were the descendants of Machir the son of Manasseh.

* ¶ These are the land assignments that Moses made
* ¶ The lands described above are the places that Moses gave to the people

**These were the portions Moses had given them:** The word *These* refers back to 13:15–31\. It indicates the regions and towns that Moses gave to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh.

#### 13:32b

**on the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan, east of Jericho.**

* when the Israelites were in the plains of Moab, east of the Jordan River, opposite Jericho.
* while they were camped on the plains of Moab, across the Jordan River, east of Jericho.

**on the plains of Moab:** The phrase *the plains of Moab* indicates a flat land on the east side of the Jordan River. Moab was one of the kingdoms on the east side of the Jordan. Moses made the distribution of land while the Israelites were camped on this plain.

**beyond the Jordan, east of Jericho:** The phrase *beyond the Jordan, east of Jericho* is written from the perspective of the author, who wrote this book in the land west of the Jordan River. It indicates that the plains of Moab were on the east side of the Jordan River. They were to the east of the town of Jericho, which was on the west side of the Jordan River.

**To the tribe of Levi, however, Moses had given no inheritance.**

* But Moses did not give an allotment to the clan of Levi,
* But Moses did not give any land to the clan of Levi.

**To the tribe of Levi, however, Moses had given no inheritance:** The tribe of Levi was the only tribe that did not receive land of their own.

The Hebrew text places the phrase *To the tribe of Levi* at the beginning of the sentence. In Hebrew this shows emphasis. In some languages it may not be natural to begin a sentence with this phrase. Use a way that is natural to emphasize that the tribe of Levi was different from the other tribes.

This verse is similar to verse 13:14\.

#### 13:33b

**The LORD, the God of Israel, is their inheritance, just as He had promised them.**

* because Yahweh, the God of Israel, promised that he himself will be their allotment.
* Instead, the Levi clan received Yahweh, the God of Israel himself, as he promised to them.

**The LORD, the God of Israel, is their inheritance:** The phrase *their inheritance* indicates that the tribe of Levi had a special relationship with Yahweh, the God of Israel. They were the only tribe that served Yahweh at his altar in the Tent of Meeting. The words here are similar to Numbers 18:20\.

**just as He had promised them:** The clause *just as He had promised them* indicates that Yahweh had previously promised this privilege to the tribe of Levi. See, for example, Deuteronomy 18:1–2\.

* ¶ This is the land that the Israelites received in the land of Canaan.
* ¶ This description that follows is about how the land of Canaan west of the Jordan was divided among the people of Israel.

**Now these are the portions that the Israelites inherited in the land of Canaan:** This sentence introduces a new topic. The topic is the areas of land which each tribe received on the west side of the Jordan River. Begin this sentence in a way that is natural in your language.

**these are the portions:** This phrase refers to the detailed description of land areas in chapters 14–19\.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> forWhat follows is an account of how the land…was divided (GNT)

> Here are the pieces of land that the people of Israel received

**portions:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *portions* is more literally “gave them as a possession.” God gave some land to each tribe of Israel. He intended that their children and grandchildren would inherit those lands forever.

Here are some other ways to translate this word:

> the land that God gave them

> the lands they received as a possession

**the land of Canaan:** The phrase *the land of Canaan* refers to the land on the west side of the Jordan River, and also to some of the other nearby lands. God first promised this land to Abraham in Genesis 15:17–21\.

**as distributed by Eleazar the priest:** *Eleazar* was the son of Aaron and he became the high priest after Aaron died. The word *priest* was used in 3:3 and you should translate it the same way in both places.

**as distributed:** The phrase that the BSB translates as *as distributed* can also be translated “divided” or “gave.”

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> they divided it among the people

> they decided what land to give to each group

**Joshua son of Nun:** This phrase was used in Joshua 1:1 and you should translate it the same way in both places.

#### 14:1c

**and the heads of the families of the tribes of Israel.**

* and the leaders of the clans gave a piece of land to each Israelite family.
* and the leaders of the families of the Israelite clans divided it among the people.

**and the heads of the families of the tribes of Israel:** This phrase refers to the leaders of the Israelite tribes. In Numbers 34:16–29 Yahweh commanded Moses to appoint one leader from each of the tribes of Israel to help assign the land along with Joshua and Eleazar the priest. Moses decided who each of these leaders would be.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> the leaders of the families of the Israelite tribes (GNT)

> the leaders of all the tribes of Israel (NCV)

##### **General Comment on 14:1a\-c**

In some languages it may be more natural to change the order of the clauses in this verse. For example:

**Their inheritance was assigned by lot**

* These leaders used lots to decide which land the people would receive
* The priests rolled stones to decide which piece of land each family will receive

**Their inheritance was assigned by lot:** It was the role of the priest to throw the lots. God used the lots to show which piece of land he would give to each family.

Here is another way to translate this clause:

> Eleazar threw stones to decide which piece of land each family would receive.

**inheritance:** This word was used in 11:23 and you should translate it the same way in both places.

**lot:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *lot* refers to small objects that the Israelite people threw to determine God’s will. It is possible that the lots were stones with a different color on each side.14:2 Bean, Albert: Lots, Holman Bible Dictionary p. 896\. Holman Bible Publishers, Nashville, TN 1991\. If you have a tradition of choosing or throwing small objects to make a decision, you can use that term here. Or you can use some other term that is familiar in your language for choosing by chance.

Here are some ways to translate this term:

> throw dice

> draw straws

#### 14:2b

#### 14:3a

**For Moses had given the inheritance**

* Moses already gave an inheritance
* Moses already assigned land

**For:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB has translated as *For* can also mean “because.” It states the reason for something. Many English versions do not translate this conjunction. For example:

> Moses had already given a grant of land to the two and a half tribes on the east side of the Jordan River. (NLT)

**Moses had given the inheritance:** This verse explains the reason why the land on the west side of the Jordan River was divided between nine and a half tribes, rather than all twelve tribes.

#### 14:3b

**east of the Jordan to the other two and a half tribes.**

* to the two and one\-half clans on the other side of the Jordan River.
* to the other two and a half clans on the east side of the Jordan River.

**east of the Jordan to the other two and a half tribes:** The*other two and a half tribes* refers to the tribes of Gad, Reuben and one half of the tribe of Manasseh.

**east of the Jordan:** The phrase *east of the Jordan* indicates the east side of the Jordan River. It may be helpful to make this clear. For example

> Moses had given the two\-and\-a\-half tribes their inheritance east of the Jordan River. (GW)

> Moses had given the other two and a half tribes their own land on the east side of the Jordan River.

#### 14:3c

**But he granted no inheritance among them to the Levites.**

* But he did not give any inheritance of land to the clan of Levi.
* Moses did not assign any land to the Levi clan.

**But he granted no inheritance among them to the Levites:** Although the BSB puts the phrase *to the Levites* at the end of the clause, it comes first in the Hebrew clause to emphasize that the Levites were different from the other tribes. Many languages will have another way to show this emphasis.

Here are some other ways to translate this clause:

> He did not give any land as an inheritance to Levi’s tribe. (GW)

> The tribe of Levi did not receive any land like the other tribes. (ERV)

**he granted no inheritance among them:** This indicates that the Levites did not receive any land. If you have translated the word inheritance as “land” in previous verses then you should translate it the same way here.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 14:3

* This happened because the clan of Joseph divided into two clans, Manasseh and Ephraim.
* There were still twelve clans even if Levi is not counted because the descendants of Joseph divided into two clans, Manasseh and Ephraim.

The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB leaves untranslated but many English versions translates as “For” is the same as the word in verse 3\. It means “because.” It introduces the reason why the tribe of Levi did not receive land of their own.

**The descendants of Joseph became two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim:** This verse explains why there were twelve tribes who inherited land, even though the Levite tribe did not receive any land. The descendants of Joseph had split into two tribes.

Here are some other ways to translate this clause:

> The descendants of Joseph had divided into two tribes—Manasseh and Ephraim. (ERV)

> Manasseh and Ephraim were the sons of Joseph. They had become two tribes. (NIRV)

#### 14:4b

**And no portion of the land was given to the Levites,**

* The clan of Levi did not receive a share of the land,
* The Levi clan did not receive any land.

**And no portion of the land was given to the Levites:** The clause *no portion of the land was given to the Levites* indicates that the Levites did not receive any land area of their own.

Here are some other ways to translate this clause:

> The Levites received no share of the land (NIV)

> The Levite tribe did not receive any land.

##### **General Comment on 14:3–4b**

The information about the Levites is repeated in 4b for emphasis. If it is not natural to repeat this information, verses three and four may be combined, as in the GNT:

> Moses had already assigned the land east of the Jordan to the other two and one\-half tribes. (The descendants of Joseph were divided into two tribes: Manasseh and Ephraim.) However, Moses gave the Levites no portion of the territory. (GNT)

#### 14:4c

**except for cities in which to live,**

* but only towns to live in,
* They only received cities to live in,

**except for cities in which to live:** The phrase *except for cities in which to live*, indicates that the Levite tribe did not receive a region of land as the other tribes did. Instead, they received towns to live in.

#### 14:4d

**along with pasturelands for their flocks and herds.**

* along with the surrounding lands for their cattle and sheep and goats to graze in.
* and the nearby land for their animals to live on.

**along with pasturelands for their flocks and herds:** The word *pasturelands* indicates fields in which cattle or other domestic animals could eat the grass.

**their flocks and herds:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates *their flocks and herds* is more literally “their acquired possessions.” It can also refer to animals. In this context it refers to other domesticated animals that the Levites owned, such as sheep and goats.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> nearby pastures for their sheep, goats, and cattle (CEV)

> fields for all their animals to live on

Here is another way to translate this clause:

> While the Israelites were camped at Gilgal, the people of Judah came to Joshua

**Gilgal:** *Gilgal* is the name of a place east of Jericho and west of the Jordan River. It is the place where the Israelites set up their camp after they crossed the Jordan River. It is first mentioned in Joshua 4:19\| and you should translate it the same way in both places.

**and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him:** The story of Caleb is told in 13\. He was one of the twelve spies who explored the land of Canaan. Caleb and Joshua were the only two of the twelve spies who trusted God.

**the Kenizzite:** There are two ways to interpret the Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Kenizzite*.

1. It indicates that Caleb is a grandson of Kenaz. For example:

    > Caleb…the grandson of Kenaz (GW) *(GW)*

2. It indicates that Caleb belongs to the family or clan of Kenaz. For example:

    > Caleb belonged to the Kenaz clan (CEV) *(BSB, CEV)*

**You know what the LORD said to Moses the man of God:** The phrase *Moses the man of God* is a title for Moses. He is called this several times, for example in Deuteronomy 33:1\. This is a term that is often used for a prophet who speaks for God, for example 1 Samuel 2:27\.

Here are some other ways to translate the phrase *Moses the man of God*:

> Moses the man who belongs to God

> the prophet Moses (NCV, CEV)

**joined the Brook of Egypt:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Brook* refers to a river. This river had water only in the rainy season. See Joshua 12:1 where this Hebrew word was translated “Valley.”

**Brook of Egypt:** The phrase *Brook of Egypt* refers to a river that drains rainwater from the Sinai Peninsula into the Mediterranean Sea. This river is usually dry but becomes a large river when it rains. It formed the boundary between Israel and Egypt. Today this river is called the Wadi el Arish.

Here are some ways to translate this phrase:

> Stream of Egypt (NET)

> River of Egypt (GW, KJV)

**turning north to Gilgal, which faces the Ascent of Adummim**

* It turns north to Gilgal, which is across from the Pass of Adummim
* It goes north toward Gilgal Town, which faces the road going through the Adummim Pass

**turning north:** The phrase *turning north* indicates that the border turned north after reaching the town of Debir.

**to Gilgal:** The phrase *to Gilgal* indicates that when the border turned north it went toward the town of Gilgal.

**Gilgal:** This town of *Gilgal* is not the same as the Gilgal mentioned in Joshua 5:9\.

**which faces the Ascent of Adummim:** The phrase *the Ascent of Adummim* refers to a pass that goes from east to west through the mountains. The road along this pass was the major road from the Dead Sea up to Jerusalem. The road was on the south side of this pass. The town of “Gilgal” was on the north side of the pass.15:7 Rasmussen, p. 225\.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Then the border went to En\-shemesh Spring

#### 15:7e

**and came out at En\-rogel.**

* and southwest to En\-rogel.
* and goes southwest to En\-rogel Spring, which ends its southward direction.

**and came out at En\-rogel:** The clause *and came out at En\-rogel* means that this was the southernmost point of the border as it went south around Jerusalem.15:7 Boling and Wright, p 368\. It does not mean that the border ended here.

**En\-rogel:** The name *En\-rogel* refers to a spring in the Kidron Valley south of Jerusalem.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> and went on to En\-rogel Spring

> and it went southwest to the spring of En\-rogel, which ends its southward direction

**Hinnom:** *Hinnom* is the name of a person. The Hebrew word *ben hinnom* means “son of Hinnom.” Some English versions keep the Hebrew word and say “valley of Ben Hinnom.” It is recommended that you follow the tradition of the major language version in your area when you translate this name.

Here are some ways that English versions translate this name:

> valley of the son of Hinnom (RSV, ESV, KJV)

> valley of Ben Hinnom (NET, NIV, NABRE, NASB, NJPS, GW, NLT)

* Then the border goes down along the northern ridge of Mount Jearim (which is also called Mount Chesalon).

**ran along the northern slope of Mount Jearim (that is, Chesalon):** The phrase *the northern slope of Mount Jearim* refers to the northern ridge of *Mount Jearim*.

**Mount Jearim (that is, Chesalon):** *Mount Jearim* was one of the low hills west of Jerusalem.

There is an interpretation issue here. There are two ways to understand the relationship between Chesalon and Mount Jearim.

1. Chesalon is another name for Mount Jearim. For example, the ESV says:

    > Mount Jearim (that is Chesalon) *(BSB, ESV, RSV, NET, NIV, GW, NJPS, GNT, KJV)*

2. Chesalon is the name of a town. For example:

    > the town of Kesalon on the northern slope of Mount Jearim (NLT) *(NLT, CEV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). This is followed by most English versions.15:10 In modern times there is a town in this area called Kesla. Thus, it is possible that there was an ancient town called Chesalon. See Woudstra, p. 255–256\.

**Chesalon:** Here are some ways that the English versions spell this word:

> Chesalon (BSB, ESV, RSV, GW, GNT, CEV, NABRE, NJPS, KJV)

> Kesalon (NIV, NET, NLT)

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> The border descended to the town of Beth\-shemesh and went on to the town of Timnah

> It continued going down southwest to Beth\-shemesh and then northwest to Timnah

**crossed to Timnah:** There is an interpretation issue here:

1. The border goes to the town of Timnah. For example:

    > and on to Timnah (GW) *(BSB, GW, NIV, NET, NABRE, NJPS, CEV, NLT, KJV)*

2. The border passes by the town of Timnah. For example:

    > passes along by Timnah (ESV) *(ESV, RSV, GNT)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\). This is the option taken by most English versions. However, the Hebrew grammar can be understood either way, and probably both are true.

> Joshua gave Caleb the son of Jephunneh a piece of land within the boundaries of the tribe of Judah, as Yahweh had told him to do

#### 15:13c

**Kiriath\-arba, that is, Hebron.**

* He gave him the town of Kiriath\-arba, which is now called Hebron.
* He received the town of Hebron which was formerly called Kiriath\-arba

**Kiriath\-arba, that is, Hebron:** The term *Kiriath\-arba* refers to the town that Joshua gave to Caleb. In Hebrew the word *Kiriath\-arba* means “town of Arba.” Some English versions translate it this way. For example:

> Caleb’s share was Hebron, which at that time was known as Arba’s Town (CEV)

**Hebron:** Hebron was the name of the town of Kiriath\-arba at the time the book of Joshua was written.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> The town Joshua gave him was Kiriath\-arba, but it is now called Hebron

> He gave Caleb the town of Hebron, which in former times was called Kiriath\-arba

#### 15:13d

**(Arba was the forefather of Anak.)**

* Arba was the ancestor of the Anak people.
* because Arba was the ancestor of the people of Anak.

**Arba was the forefather of Anak:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *the forefather of Anak* is more literally “the father of the Anak.” The word “father” in Hebrew is often used to mean ancestor. For example:

> Arba was the ancestor of the Anak people\-group (T4T)

**Anak:** There is an interpretation issue concerning the word Anak.

1. The word *Anak* refers to a group of people, the descendants of a man called *Anak*. For example:

    > because Arba was the famous ancestor of the Anakim (CEV) *(CEV, NIV)*

2. The word *Anak* refers to a person, the son of a man named Arba. For example:

    > Arba was the father of Anak (RSV) *(BSB, RSV, NET, ESV, GW, GNT, NJPS, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\) which is supported by Hebrew grammars and is implied by the information in verse 14:15\.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Arba was the ancestor of the Anak people

> Arba was the ancestor of the people of Anak

#### 15:14a

**And Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak—**

* Caleb forced the three clans of Anak people to leave there.
* Caleb attacked the three clans of Anak who lived in Hebron and made them leave.

**And Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak:** The clause *Caleb drove out from there* indicates that Caleb attacked the *three sons of Anak* and made them leave Hebron.

**the three sons of Anak:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *sons* can refer to a group of descendants. In this verse it is likely that the *three sons of Anak* refers to three tribes of the descendants of Anak.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Caleb forced three tribes of Anak people to leave there

#### 15:15a

**From there he marched against the inhabitants of Debir**

* Then he went on from Hebron to fight the people of Debir.
* After that Caleb attacked the town of Debir

**From there he marched against the inhabitants of Debir:** The town called *Debir* in this verse is not the same as the place mentioned in 15:7\. The location of this town is not clear.

**he marched:** Caleb *marched* uphill to fight against the people of Debir. Hebrew verbs keep track of elevation, and thus it says “went up.” If your language does not keep track of elevation, it may be more natural to say “went.”

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Then he went from Hebron to fight the people of Debir

> Caleb next went to attack the town of Debir

#### 15:15b

#### 15:16a

**And Caleb said, “To the man who strikes down Kiriath\-sepher and captures it,**

* Caleb said, “Whoever attacks Kiriath\-sepher and captures it,
* Then Caleb said, “The man who fights and defeats the town of Kiriath\-sepher

**And Caleb said, “To the man who strikes down Kiriath\-sepher and captures it:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *strikes* means “to hit.” This is a Hebrew idiom which means that somebody would attack Kiriath\-sepher and capture it.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> whoever defeats the town of Kiriath\-sepher

> the man who attacks the town of Kiriath\-sepher and captures it

#### 15:16b

**So Othniel son of Caleb’s brother Kenaz captured the city:** *Kenaz* was the father of *Othniel* and the younger brother of *Caleb*.

**Othniel:** Here are some ways that English versions spell the name of this person.

> Othni\-el (RSV, KJV)

### Paragraph 15:13–19

This paragraph tells about Caleb and his daughter Acsah (also spelled Aksah or Achsah in other English versions). The story of Caleb starts in Numbers 13\. In Joshua 14:6–15 Caleb received land from Joshua. In this paragraph Caleb gave Acsah a gift of land when she married Othni\-el.

#### 15:18a

**One day Acsah came to Othniel and urged him to ask her father for a field.**

* When she arrived to marry him, she urged Othni\-el to ask her father for a field.
* When she became his wife, Achsah told Othni\-el to ask her father to give her a field.

**One day Acsah came to Othniel and urged him to ask her father for a field:** There is an interpretation issue with the Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *One day Acsah came to Othniel*.

1. It refers to the time of Acsah’s marriage to Othniel. For example:

    > On the wedding day (GNT) *(GNT, NLT, CEV)*

2. It refers to an unspecified day. For example:

    > One day when she came to Othniel (NIV) *(BSB, NIV, NET)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), which is supported by commentaries15:18 See for example, Woudstra, p. 241\. and by several English versions.

**urged him:** There is a textual issue with this Hebrew word.

1. The Hebrew text and most Greek translations read “she urged him.” For example:

    > she urged him (NIV) *(BSB, NIV, ESV, RSV, NABRE, NJPS, NLT, CEV, GW, NCV, KJV)*

2. One Greek translation reads “he urged her.” For example:

    > Othniel urged her (GNT) *(GNT, NET, NEB)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\). These are the words of the Hebrew text and of most Greek manuscripts and the reading followed by most English versions.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> When Acsah came to marry Othni\-el, she urged Othni\-el to ask her father for a field

> When she became his wife, Acsah told Othni\-el to ask her father to give her a field

#### 15:18b

**When she got off her donkey,**

* So Achsah got down from her donkey
* Then Achsah went to see her father, Caleb. As she got off her donkey

**When she got off her donkey:** Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Acsah got down from her donkey

> as she got off her donkey

To make a smoother transition between 18a and 18b, some English versions add implied information. The implied information is underlined below. For example:

> Right after the wedding, Achsah started telling Othniel that he ought to ask her father for a field. She went to see her father, and while she was getting down from her donkey (CEV)

> When Caleb’s daughter married Othniel, she told him to ask her father to give her a field. Then Acsah went to talk with her father Caleb. As she got down from her donkey (T4T)

It is recommended that you add implied information if it will help readers to understand the meaning clearly.

**“Give me a blessing,” she answered.**

* She said, “Give me a gift as a sign of your blessing.”
* Achsah answered, “Do something to show that you have blessed me.”

**“Give me a blessing,” she answered:** In this context, the *blessing* that Acsah asks for is a gift. She asks her father to give her a source of water for her land.

#### 15:19b

**“Since you have given me land in the Negev,**

* You have given me land in the dry southern region,
* You gave me dry land in the south,

**Since you have given me land in the Negev:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *you have given me* is more literally “You gave me.” The word *Negev* often refers to the dry desert land in the south of Judah. In this context it probably refers to dry land south of the town of Debir. Caleb gave Debir to Othni\-el. The town had no natural water source, so Acsah asked to be given a source of water that was nearby.15:19 Coleson, p. 132–134\.

> because you have given me land in the dry south region

2. These names refer to one place that has two different names. For example, the NIV says:

    > Gederah (or Gederothaim) *(BSB, NIV, NET, NCV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). This agrees with the Hebrew text and is followed by most English versions.15:36 If Gederah and Gederothaim are two names for the same place, then the list in this paragraph comes to a total of fourteen towns.

### Section 16:1–17:18 The clans of Ephraim and Manasseh received their land

This section describes the boundaries of the land given to Ephraim and to Manasseh, and the towns within each of their lands.

#### 16:1a

**The allotment for the descendants of Joseph extended from the Jordan at Jericho**

* ¶ The land that the descendants of Joseph received began at the Jordan River near Jericho,
* ¶ The southern border of the land given to the descendants of Joseph started at the Jordan River near the town of Jericho.

**The allotment for the descendants of Joseph:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *The allotment* is more literally “the lot went out.” There is a similar phrase in Joshua 15:1\. It is recommended that you translate this phrase in a similar way in both places.

**the descendants of Joseph:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *the descendants of Joseph* is more literally “the sons of Joseph.” Joseph had two sons: Ephraim and Manasseh. Their descendants became the clans of Ephraim and Manasseh.

Here are some ways to translate this phrase:

> the descendants of Joseph (BSB, RSV, GNT, NLT, NET)

> the people of Joseph (ESV)

> Joseph (NIV, GW)

> the children of Joseph (KJV)

**extended from the Jordan at Jericho:** The clause *extended from the Jordan at Jericho* describes the starting point of the southern border of the land given to Ephraim and Manasseh. The eastern point of the border was at the Jordan River near the town of Jericho.

> The south border of the land given to the descendants of Joseph started at the Jordan River, near the town of Jericho

#### 16:1b

**to the waters of Jericho on the east, through the wilderness**

* to the east of the springs of Jericho. It went west into the wilderness.
* It began to the east of the springs at the town of Jericho and then went west into the wilderness.

**to the waters of Jericho on the east:** The phrase *waters of Jericho* refers to springs that were north of the town of Jericho.

**through the wilderness:** The phrase *through the wilderness* indicates that the border then continued west into the wilderness.

**wilderness:** A *wilderness* is an uncultivated and uninhabited area. In this verse it refers to the Judean wilderness. The Judean wilderness is between the Judean mountains and the valley of the Dead Sea. This wilderness is a rocky place that descends steeply from the mountains into the valley. It consists of flat plateaus, rounded hills, deep canyons, and cliffs.Rasmussen p. 42\. It receives little rainfall and no crops can grow there. It is not a typical desert with large areas of sand. Many languages may have a term for an uncultivated area or an uninhabited place.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> It then went to the east of the springs of Jericho and continued west into the wilderness

> The border began to the east of the springs at the town of Jericho and went west into the wilderness

#### 16:1c

**that goes up from Jericho into the hill country of Bethel.**

* It ascended from Jericho up into the hill country to Bethel.
* From Jericho it went up into the mountain country as far as the town of Bethel.

**that goes up from Jericho into the hill country of Bethel:** The clause *goes up from Jericho* indicates that the border ascended in elevation as it went through the wilderness, into the hill country to the town of Bethel.

**hill country:** The term *hill country* refers to the central mountain range which runs from the north to the south of Israel. This area receives a lot of rain and farmers plant crops in terraces along the hillsides. See how you translated this phrase in Joshua 9:1\.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> The border went from Jericho up into the hill country to the town of Bethel

> From Jericho it went up into the mountains as far as Bethel

#### 16:2a

**It went on from Bethel (that is, Luz)**

* It then continued west from Bethel, which used to be called Luz.
* The border went to the west from the town of Bethel. In the past Bethel was called Luz.

**It went on from Bethel (that is, Luz):** There is a textual issue in this verse.

1. The Septuagint reads from Bethel (that is Luz). *(BSB, NIV, NLT, NCV)*
2. The Masoretic Text reads from Bethel to Luz. *(RSV, ESV, NJPS, NABRE, GNT, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\) since this agrees with four other biblical references. In Genesis 28:19, 35:6, Joshua 18:13 and Judges 1:23 Bethel is identified with Luz.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> it then continued westward from Bethel, which used to be called Luz

#### 16:2b

**and proceeded to the border of the Archites in Ataroth.**

* It continued to Ataroth in the area of the Archites.
* It went to the town of Ataroth in the land of the Arch people.

**and proceeded to the border of the Archites in Ataroth:** The *Archites* were a group of people who are mentioned in only one other place in the Bible. In 2 Samuel 15:32 Hushai the Archite is named as a counselor of David.This is not the same as the group mentioned in Genesis 10:17, where the Hebrew name is spelled differently.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> The border continued to the town of Ataroth in the territory of the Archites

> It continued to the town of Ataroth in the land of the Arch people

**in Ataroth:** There is an interpretation issue with the term *Ataroth*.

1. It refers to a town called *Ataroth* whose location is unknown. This town is also mentioned in verse 16:7\. *(BSB, RSV, ESV, NIV, NJPS, NLT, NCV, NET, GW)*
2. It refers to the town of Ataroth Addar, which is mentioned in Joshua 16:5 and 18:13\. The GNT adds the word Addar in verse 2 to show that these both refer to the same place. *(GNT)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\) and translate this term *Ataroth*. Biblical scholars do not agree on whether the town referred to in this verse is Ataroth Addar or is a different town called Ataroth.

* It then went westward downhill to the area of the Japhlet people,
* Then the border descended west to the land of the Japhlet people,

**Then it descended westward to the border of the Japhletites:** Japhlet was the son of Heber from the clan of Asher. He is mentioned in 1 Chronicles 7:32–33\. The *Japhletites* are descendants of Japhlet.

In verse 2 the border ascended into the hill country. Now it has passed over the hills and is going downhill on its way toward the Mediterranean Sea.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> It then went downhill in a westward direction to the area where the Japhlet people lived

> Then the border descended west to the land of the descendants of Japhlet

#### 16:3b

**as far as the border of Lower Beth\-horon**

* continuing west as far as Lower Beth\-horon.
* and went on to the area of Lower Beth\-horon town.

**as far as the border of Lower Beth\-horon:** The border continued to the west until it reached the town of Lower Beth\-horon. Lower Beth\-horon is first mentioned in Joshua 10:10\.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> The border continued west as far as the town of Lower Beth\-horon

> and went on as far as the area of Lower Beth\-horon

#### 16:3c

**and on to Gezer, and it ended at the Sea.**

* Then it went to Gezer and ended at the Mediterranean Sea.
* It continued west to the town of Gezer and ended at the Mediterranean Sea.

**and on to Gezer, and it ended at the Sea:** *Gezer* is a town that was seventeen miles southeast of the town of Joppa. Joshua and the Israelites had defeated this town. The account of the battle is in Joshua 10:33\.

**the Sea:** The term *the Sea* refers to the Mediterranean Sea.

* So the descendants of Joseph, that is the clans of Ephraim and Manasseh, received this land as their inheritance.
* The sons of Joseph, which were the clans of Ephraim and Manasseh, received their land according to the boundary lines given above.

**So Ephraim and Manasseh, the sons of Joseph, received their inheritance:** This verse is the conclusion to the paragraph. It may be helpful to add a conjunction or a phrase which shows that this is a conclusion, like the BSB does with *So*. For another example:

> The people of Joseph, namely Manasseh and Ephraim, received their land according to the boundary lines given above

**Ephraim and Manasseh:** It may be helpful to state that the clans of *Ephraim and Manasseh* are the descendants of Joseph. For example:

> the descendants of Joseph, that is, the clans of Ephraim and Manasseh

**Manasseh:** *Manasseh* was the first son of Joseph so he is listed first in the Hebrew. In the paragraph that follows, the land that Ephraim received is described before that of Manasseh. This reflects the story in Genesis 48, in which Joseph blessed Ephraim before he blessed Manasseh.Woudstra p.256\.

**This was the territory of the descendants of Ephraim by their clans:** The phrase *the territory of the descendants of Ephraim* refers to the land that the clan of Ephraim received.

**clans:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *clans* actually refers to families or groups of people within a clan. This word is translated in the display as “sub\-clans.” See the note at Joshua 7:14\.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> according to their sub\-clans

> each sub\-clan in the clan of Ephraim received their own portion of land

**The border of their inheritance went from Ataroth\-addar in the east:** The boundary points in this verse define the southern boundary of the clan of Ephraim.

* The border then continued to the Mediterranean Sea.
* It then went down to the Mediterranean Sea.

**and out toward the Sea:** There is an interpretation issue in this verse.

1. The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *toward the Sea* refers to the Mediterranean Sea. *(BSB, RSV, NRSV, NET, ESV, NIV, NJPS, NABRE, GNT, KJV)*
2. The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *toward the Sea* means to the west.

    > Then the border went westward (NASB) *(NASB, GW)*

**Michmethath:** The town of *Michmethath* was on the north border of Ephraim, near the town of Shechem. The exact location of Michmethath is unknown.

The English versions spell Michmethath in several ways:

> which were in the land that belonged to the clan of Manasseh

##### **General Comment on 16:9**

It may be more natural to reorder the parts of this verse so that the last clause follows the first. For example:

> The clan of Ephraim also received other cities and the villages that surrounded them. These towns and villages were in the land that belonged to the clan of Manasseh.

* So the Canaanite people still live among the Ephraim people up to this time.
* That is why the Canaan people still live there along with the Ephraim people.

**So the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites to this day:** This clause indicates that the people of Canaan still lived alongside the people of the clan of Ephraim.

**to this day:** The phrase *to this day* indicates that they still lived there when the book of Joshua was written.

#### 17:1a

**Now this was the allotment for the tribe of Manasseh**

* ¶ Then the clan of Manasseh received land according to the lot.
* ¶ This is the land that Joshua gave to the clan of Manasseh

**Now this was the allotment for the tribe of Manasseh:** The clause *allotment for the tribe of Manasseh* translates the same Hebrew words as in Joshua 15:1, except that here it refers to the clans of the tribe of Manasseh rather than the clans of the tribe of Judah. It refers to the land that the clan of Manasseh received when Joshua and Eleazar cast lots for them. It is recommended that you translate this the same way as you did in 15:1\.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Then the clan of Manasseh received land according to the lot

> Then the descendants of Manasseh were assigned land by lot

> Joshua gave land to the descendants of Manasseh according to the lot

#### 17:1b

**as Joseph’s firstborn son,**

* Manasseh was the first\-born son of Joseph.
* who was the elder son of Joseph.

**as Joseph’s firstborn son:** Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> He was Joseph’s first son

> Manasseh was the oldest son of Joseph

**as:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *as* shows that the phrase “Joseph’s firstborn son” is additional information.

Here are some other ways to translate this clause:

> The tribe of Manasseh, Joseph’s firstborn son, was also allotted land (NET)

> This was the allotment for the tribe of Manasseh as Joseph’s firstborn (NIV)

> A part of the land west of the Jordan was assigned to some of the families descended from Joseph’s older son Manasseh (GNT)

#### 17:1c

**namely for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh and father of the Gileadites,**

* Machir, the firstborn son of Manasseh and the father of Gilead,
* Machir was Manasseh’s oldest son. The name of Machir’s son was Gilead.

**for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh and father of the Gileadites:** There is an interpretation issue concerning the name *Gileadites*.

1. *Gileadites* is the name of a person, Gilead. For example:

    > To Machir…the father of Gilead (ESV) *(ESV, RSV, NET, NLT, NABRE, NJPS, GNT, CEV, KJV)*

2. *Gileadites* is the name of a group of people who descended from a person name Gilead. For example:

    > Makir was the ancestor of the Gileadites (NIV) *(BSB, NIV)*

3. *Gileadites* is the name of a region. For example:

    > Machir…the ancestor of the people living in Gilead (GW) *(GW)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). In this phrase the word “Gilead” refers to a person, not to the region of Gilead. This is the interpretation taken by the majority of English versions and by some commentaries.Woudstra, p. 263\. The person named Gilead is also mentioned in Numbers 26:29–30 and 1 Chronicles 7:14\|. The region of Gilead is mentioned in Joshua 17:1d.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> Machir was the firstborn son of Manasseh and the father of Gilead

> Machir was Manasseh’s oldest son. The name of his son was Gilead

#### 17:1d

**who had received Gilead and Bashan**

* received the territories of Gilead and Bashan,
* Machir was assigned the lands of Gilead and Bashan east of the Jordan River,

**who had received Gilead and Bashan:** *Gilead and Bashan* were regions. They were areas of land that were east of the Jordan River.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> he received the regions of Gilead and Bashan east of the Jordan River

> Machir received the lands of Gilead and Bashan which were east of the Jordan River

> they gave Machir land in the regions of Gilead and Bashan which were east of the Jordan River

#### 17:1e

**because Machir was a man of war.**

* because he was a skilled fighter.
* because he fought well in battle.

**because Machir was a man of war:** The phrase *man of war* indicates that Machir was a skilled fighter. Numbers 32:39\.tells how Machir and his descendants went to Gilead and defeated the people who were living there. Because of this he received Gilead as his inheritance.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> because he was a skilled fighter

> because he fought well in battle. He had fought the people of Gilead and Bashan and captured their land.

##### **General Comment on 17:1d–e**

In some languages it may be more natural to translate 1e before 1d. For example:

> Machir was a skilled fighter, so he received the territories of Gilead and Bashan on the east side of the Jordan River.

#### 17:2a

**So this allotment was for the rest of the descendants of Manasseh—**

* The rest of the clan of Manasseh also received land by lot
* The other descendants of Manasseh were also assigned land.

**So this allotment was for the rest of the descendants of Manasseh:** The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as *allotment was for* is more literally “was to.” Both the subject and the object of this clause are missing. In some languages it will be necessary to make them clear. For example:

> Joshua gave land to the other descendants of Manasseh according to the lot

**the rest of the descendants of Manasseh:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *the rest of the descendants of Manasseh* is more literally “the remaining sons of Manasseh.” This phrase refers to the descendants of Manasseh who did not receive land east of the Jordan River. These people were descendants of Machir and his son Gilead.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> the rest of the clan of Manasseh also received land by lot

> the other descendants of Manasseh were also assigned land

> they gave land also to other descendants of Manasseh

#### 17:2b

**the clans of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida.**

* according to their sub\-clans. These are the names of the sub\-clans: Abi\-ezer, Helek, Asri\-el, Hepher, and Shemida.
* The names of the families were Abi\-ezer and Helek and Asri\-el and Shechem and Hepher and Shemida.

**the clans:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *the clans* was used in Joshua 16:5a. It is recommended that you translate it in the same way as you did in that verse. The Hebrew word is translated in the display as “sub\-clans.” See the note at Joshua 7:14\.

**Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida:** These are the names of the sub\-clans that received land.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> according to their sub\-clans. These are the names of the sub\-clans: Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida

> The names of the sub\-clans that received land were Abiezer and Helek and Asriel and Shechem and Hepher and Shemida

#### 17:2c

**These are the other male descendants of the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph.**

* They were the male descendants of Manasseh, who was the son of Joseph.
* They were the males who inherited land in the family of Manasseh, who was one of the sons of Joseph.

**These are the other male descendants of the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph:** The writer wanted to make clear that these were *male descendants* of Manasseh, because in the next verse he talked about the female descendants of Manasseh.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> The people named above were the male descendants of Manasseh

> Those people were the other sons of Manasseh, and the heads of their sub\-clans

**But Zelophehad son of Hepher (the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh)**

* ¶ Zelophehad was the son of Hepher, and the grandson of Gilead, whose father was Machir and whose grandfather was Manasseh.
* ¶ But Zelophehad, son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh,

**But:** The Hebrew particle that the BSB translates as *But* shows a contrast. Unlike the fathers of the sub\-clans listed in the previous verse, Zelophehad had only daughters. He did not have any sons. Use a word or particle that is natural in your language to mark a contrast.

**Zelophehad son of Hepher (the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh) had no sons but only daughters:** Many languages have their own way of stating this kind of genealogy. Use whatever is the most natural way in your language.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the grandson of Gilead, and the great\-grandson of Machir, whose father was Manasseh had no sons. He only had daughters

> Zelophehad was the son of Hepher and the grandson of Gilead, whose father was Machir. Gilead’s grandfather was Manasseh. Zelophehad had only daughters and no sons

* These women went to Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun and the heads of the clans. They said to them,

**They approached Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders, and said:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates *leaders* is more literally “one who is lifted up.” It refers to the heads of the clans. This Hebrew word was used in Joshua 14:1 (see “heads of the families”). It is recommended that you translate it the same way as you did there.

* “Yahweh commanded Moses to give us land to possess like he also gave to our male relatives.”

**The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers:** The phrase *among our brothers* indicates that the daughters would receive land as their male relatives did. The word *brothers* cannot refer to literal brothers, because Zelophehad had no sons.

The story of how Yahweh commanded Moses to give land to Zelophehad’s daughters is told in Numbers 27:1–11\.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Yahweh told Moses to give us(excl) some land for our own, as he did for our male relatives

#### 17:4c

**So Joshua gave them an inheritance among their father’s brothers,**

* He gave them land along with the male relatives of their father.
* He assigned them some land among the land of their father’s male relatives.

**So Joshua gave them an inheritance among their father’s brothers:** The Hebrew does not specify who *gave them an inheritance* and some versions use “he” here since it is not certain whether this refers to Joshua or to Eleazar the priest. If it is necessary to make this explicit then it is recommended that you choose *Joshua*, as in the BSB.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

* That is why the clan of Manasseh had ten sections of land west of the Jordan River.

**Thus ten shares fell to Manasseh:** The clause *ten shares fell to Manasseh* indicates that the clan of Manasseh received ten pieces of land on the west side of the Jordan River. The sub\-clans of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem and Shemida each received one piece of land. The sub\-clan of Hepher received five pieces of land. It received one piece for each of Zelophehad’s daughters.

**because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance among his sons.**

* This was because the female descendants of Manasseh received land just like the male descendants.
* The daughters of Zelophehad, Manasseh’s descendant, were assigned land along with their male relatives.

**because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance among his sons:** The clause *the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance among his sons* states the reason that the clan of Manasseh received ten areas of land. In some languages it may be helpful to reorder the information in verses 5 and 6 to make this clear. See the General Comment on 17:5–6a.

**the daughters of Manasseh:** The phrase *the daughters of Manasseh* refers to the five daughters of Zelophehad. These women were fifth\-generation descendants of Manasseh. They were not literally his daughters. The Hebrew language uses “daughters” to refer to female descendants.

**his sons:** The phrase *his sons* refers to five of the sons of Gilead. These men were third\-generation descendants of Manasseh. They were not literally his sons. The Hebrew language uses “sons” to refer to male descendants.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> This happened because the female descendants of Manasseh received portions of land like the male descendants

> This was because the daughters of Zelophehad, who were descended from Manasseh, were assigned land along with their male relatives

##### **General Comment on 17:5–6a**

In some languages it may be more natural to reorder these verses and put the reason first. For example:

> 6aBecause the female descendants of Manasseh received portions of land like their male relatives, 5athe clan of Manasseh received ten portions of land on the west side of the Jordan River. 5bThe other descendants of Manasseh received the lands of Gilead and Bashan 5con the east side of the Jordan River.

* The land of Gilead had been assigned to the other descendants of Manasseh.
* Other descendants of Manasseh had received the land of Gilead.

**And the land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh:** The phrase *the rest of the sons of Manasseh* refers to the other descendants of Manasseh who were mentioned in Joshua 17:1\. They received the land of Gilead on the east side of the Jordan River.

It is not clear from scripture exactly how these descendants of Manasseh were related to the six sons of Gilead. Possibly Machir had other sons who were brothers of Gilead.

**Now the border of Manasseh went from Asher to Michmethath near Shechem:** The term *Asher* refers to the clan of Asher. Their land was northwest of the land belonging to the clan of Manasseh.

**Michmethath:** The town of *Michmethath* was on the northern border of Ephraim, near the town of Shechem. The exact location is unknown. This town was mentioned in Joshua 16:6b.

**Shechem:** The town of Shechem was in the territory assigned to Ephraim.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Manasseh’s land bordered on the clan of Asher’s land in the northwest, and reached to the town of Michmethath in the south. Michmethath was east of Shechem town

**From there the border continued southward to the Brook of Kanah. There were cities belonging to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh:** There is an interpretation issue in this verse. Scholars do not agree on how the word *southward* relates to the parts of this verse.

1. It relates to the phrase *the cities* in verse 9b. For example:

    > These cities, to the south of the brook… (ESV) *(ESV, RSV, NABRE, NJPS, NLT, GNT, CEV, KJV)*

2. It relates to the term *border* in verse 9a. For example:

    > Then the boundary continued south to the Kanah Ravine (NIV) *(BSB, NIV, NET, GW)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\) along with the majority of English versions and some commentaries.Woudstra, p. 266\. The border of Manasseh went south of the Kanah River for some distance. However, there were some towns belonging to the clan of Ephraim that were within the borders of the land assigned to Manasseh.

Here is another way to translate this part of the verse:

> Some towns that belonged to the clan of Ephraim were south of the river, among the towns that belonged to the clan of Manasseh

**From there the border continued southward to the Brook of Kanah.**

* Then the border descended to the southwest to the Kanah River.

* “Why did you give us only one share of land to be our own?
* “Why have you given just one area of land to our clan?

**Why have you given us only one portion as an inheritance:** The Hebrew text considers the clan of Joseph as a single entity. Because the clan of Joseph included many people, it is more natural to translate the Hebrew pronoun “me" with a plural pronoun *us*.

**and all the Canaanites who live in the valley have iron chariots:** The clan of Joseph considered the mountain country to be too small for them, but they could not expand into the valley because the Canaanite people already lived there.

**iron chariots:** A “chariot” is a war cart with two wheels which was pulled by horses. The wheels were reinforced with iron. The Israelites did not have war vehicles. The *chariots* gave the Canaanites an advantage over the Israelites when they fought each other.

* “Do not delay any longer. Go and settle in the land that Yahweh has given you. He is the God whom your ancestors worshiped.

**How long will you put off entering and possessing the land that the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you?:** This is a rhetorical question. It functions as a rebuke. Joshua rebuked the Israelites because they had not taken the land that God gave them.

Here are two ways to translate this rebuke:

* As a rhetorical question. For example:

    > How long will you wait before you begin to take possession of the land that the Lord, the God of your ancestors, has given you? (NIV)

* As a rebuke. For example:

    > You should not have waited so long to take possession of the land that Yahweh the God of your ancestors has given you

Translate this as a natural rebuke in your language.

**How long will you put off:** The Hebrew participle that the BSB translates as *put off* indicates that the Israelite people were lazy, or slow to act.

**you:** This is a plural *you*. Joshua spoke to the people of Israel.

**entering and possessing the land:** The clause *entering and possessing the land* indicates that the Israelites should enter the land to live in it. They had conquered the land but they had not yet settled down in it.Expositor’s Bible Commentary volume 2\.

**you:** In verse 4 Joshua told the people of Israel that they must choose three men from each clan. He referred to them in the third person. In this verse Joshua addresses the chosen men in the second person. It may be more natural in some languages to keep referring to the men in the third person. For example:

Inside the tent of meeting was the ark of the covenant that was a symbol of God’s presence. The phrase *here in the presence of the LORD our God* indicates that Joshua threw the lots in front of the tent of meeting, the place where God met with his people. The Israelites believed that Yahweh had control over the way the lot would fall.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

**From there the border crossed over to the southern slope of Luz**

* From there the border passed along the mountain slope south of Luz,
* Then the boundary went along the mountain ridge south of the town of Luz.

**From there the border crossed over to the southern slope of Luz:** The Hebrew clause behind this verse is more literally “the boundary passed to Luz, to the shoulder of Luz, to the south.”

There is an interpretation issue in this verse. It concerns the placement of the Hebrew word translated as *to the southern slope*.

1. The Hebrew word translated as *to the southern slope* modifies the mountain ridge. It means that the mountain ridge is south of Luz. For example:

    > From there it crossed to the south slope of Luz (NIV) *(BSB, NIV, NJB, NABRE, NET, GW, NLT, GNT, CEV)*

2. The Hebrew word that means “to the south” modifies the boundary line. It means that the boundary line went south to Luz town. For example:

    > From there the boundary passes along southward in the direction of Luz, to the shoulder of Luz (ESV) *(ESV, RSV, NJPS)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\) along with many English versions and commentaries.Woudstra p 276\.

**the southern slope of Luz:** The *southern slope of Luz* refers to a mountain ridge that was south of the town of Luz. Compare this with “the northern slope of Jericho” in 18:12b.

Here is another way to translate this part of the verse:

> Then border then went along the mountain ridge that was south of Luz town

> From there it went to Luz…The border ran along the ridge south of Luz (CEV)

**Luz:** The town of *Luz* was mentioned in Joshua 16:2\.

#### 18:13b

#### 18:15b

**and extended westward to the spring at the Waters of Nephtoah.**

* and went to the spring of Nephtoah.
* Then the boundary continued to the spring of water called Nephtoah.

**and extended westward:** The Hebrew text is difficult. The Hebrew text reads “and the boundary goes westward.” However, that contradicts verse 14\. In verse 14 the western boundary came to an end. The description of the southern boundary begins here and is described from west to east. The English versions have handled this difficulty in several ways:

1. Some versions omit the word *westward*. For example:

    > and projected… (NABRE) *(NABRE, GNT)*

2. Some versions follow the Hebrew text. For example:

    > and extended westward (NET) *(BSB, NET, GW, NASB, NJPS)*

3. Some versions change the text to follow Joshua 15:9, which describes the same border, going from east to west. For example:

    > and the boundary goes from there to Ephron (RSV) *(RSV, ESV)*

4. Some versions move the word “west” to a different place in the sentence. For example:

    > The southern side began at the outskirts of Kiriath Jearim on the west (NIV) *(NIV)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\). This makes the least change to the text, while still making sense. If you do this, it is recommended that you add a footnote to explain the Hebrew text. For example:

> FOOTNOTE: The Hebrew text says: “and the boundary goes westward.”

**to the spring at the Waters of Nephtoah:** This is the spring mentioned in Joshua 15:9b. You should translate this phrase as you did there.

**Then it went on to the northern slope of Beth\-arabah**

* It went along the north side of the slope overlooking the Jordan River valley.
* From there it passed north of the ridge that faced the valley of the Jordan River

**Then it went on to the northern slope of Beth\-arabah:** There is a textual issue about the Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Beth\-arabah*.

1. The Hebrew text reads “in front of the Arabah.” For example:

    > It crossed to the slope in front of the Arabah to the north (NET) *(NET, NASB, NABRE, NJPS, GW, GNT, NLT, KJV)*

2. The Septuagint reads “Beth\-arabah.” For example:

    > It continued to the northern slope of Beth Arabah (NIV) *(BSB, NIV, RSV, NRSV, NJB, ESV)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\). This is the reading of the Hebrew text, and is followed by many English versions and Bible commentaries.Woudstra p. 277\.

Some versions follow the Septuagint because they compare this verse with Joshua 15:6\. The Hebrew text of Joshua 15:5 reads “It passed along to Beth\-arabah to the north.” Joshua 15:6 and 18:18 describe the same boundary, although they trace it in different directions.

**Beth\-arabah:** The word “arabah” is a Hebrew word that refers to the valley of the Jordan River.

Based on option (1\) of the previous note, here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> From there it passed along the north side of the slope overlooking the Jordan Valley (NLT)

> and passed north of the ridge overlooking the Jordan Valley (GNT)

* That describes the land that the Benjamin clan received. Each family received land within these boundaries.

**These were the borders around the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Benjamin:** The clause *These were the borders around the inheritance* is a conclusion to Joshua 18:12–20\. We have now made a circle around all four of the boundary lines of the land that Benjamin received.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> This was the land that the clan of Benjamin received as their inheritance

> That described the land that the Benjamin clan received as its permanent possession

**These were the borders around the inheritance:** The phrase *the borders around* refers to the boundary lines on all sides: north, south, east and west.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> These boundaries marked out the land that they received according to their family groups

> Each clan received land within these boundaries

In some languages it may be more natural to combine the phrase *the borders around* with the information in 18:20b. For example:

> These were the borders of the land which the clan of Benjamin received as their inheritance

> Those boundaries described the land that the Benjamin clan received

**the clans:** The phrase *the clans* actually refers to the families within the clan of Benjamin.

* They received these towns as their permanent possession: Beer\-sheba, which is also called Sheba, and Moladah.
* The land that was assigned to them included the following towns: Beer\-sheba or Sheba town, and Moladah town,

**and included Beersheba (or Sheba), Moladah:** The towns listed in verses 2–6 were in the south part of the land that belonged to the clan of Judah.

**Beersheba:** There is also an interpretation issue with the word *Beersheba*.

1. *Sheba* is another name for the town of Beersheba. For example:

    > Beersheba (or Sheba), Moladah (NIV) *(BSB, NIV, NET, NJPS, NASB, GW, REB, KJV)*

2. *Sheba* is a different town. It is not the same town as Beersheba. For example:

    > Beersheba, Sheba, Moladah (ESV) *(ESV, RSV, NRSV, NLT, GNT)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\) along with many English versions. There is a similar list of the towns that belonged to the clan of Simeon in 1 Chronicles 4:28\. That list does not include the town of *Sheba*. Moreover, if *Sheba* is counted as an independent town in this list, the total number of towns would come to fourteen, rather than thirteen, as stated in verse 6\. Because of this, many Bible scholars consider the term Sheba to be an alternative name for the town of Beersheba.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> They received the following towns as its permanent possession: Beersheba, which is also called Sheba, and Moladah

> The land that was assigned to them included the following towns: Beersheba, or Sheba, and Moladah

**Sheba:** There is a textual issue with the word *Sheba*.

1. The text should say Sheba. This follows the Masoretic Text. *(BSB, NIV, NET, RSV, ESV, NJPS, NASB, GW, GNT, KJV)*
2. The text should say Shema. This follows the Septuagint, and it also agrees with Joshua 15:26\. *(NABRE, NJB, CEV)*

* Their land also included the towns of Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan. The number of these towns was four towns with the villages that were near them.

**Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan—four cities, along with their villages:** There is a textual issue in the first part of the word *Rimmon* (some versions have “En\-rimmon”):

1. En\-rimmon is two towns: Ain and Rimmon. This is the way the vowels are written in the Masoretic text. *(BSB, NRSV, NIV, ESV, NJB, NABRE, NJPS, NET, NASB, REB, GNT, KJV)*
2. En\-rimmon is one town. This is the reading of the Septuagint. *(RSV, CEV)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\) along with the majority of English versions. This also agrees with the list of the same towns in Joshua 15:32\.

The towns of Ain and Rimmon were in the southern part of Judah’s land. The towns of Ether and Ashan were farther north, in the Shephelah district.Woudstra p. 281\.

In some languages it may be more natural to combine the information in this verse so that there is less repetition. For example:

> Simeon's tribal land was actually inside Judah's territory. Judah had received too much land for the number of people in its tribe, so part of Judah's land was given to Simeon. (CEV)

**It went up westward to Maralah,**

* The border went west to the town of Maralah.
* From there the boundary went west to the town of Maralah,

**It went up westward to Maralah:** The clause *went up westward to Maralah* indicates that the boundary line continued westward from Sarid town. The southern boundary line of Zebulun’s land followed the course of the Kishon River.Aharoni p. 257\. The Kishon River flows from east to northwest through the Valley of Jezreel and enters the Mediterranean Sea at the port of Haifa.

**Maralah:** It is not certain where this town was located.

There is an interpretation issue with the term *Maralah*. Bible scholars divide the Hebrew words in two different ways.

1. The name of the town is Maralah. *(BSB, NRSV, NIV, NASB, NJPS, NET, NLT, GW, REB, NJB, CEV, KJV)*
2. The name of the town is Mareal. The Hebrew word “Maralah” should be separated into “Mareal” and “\-ah.” The last syllable \-ah is a Hebrew directional. *(RSV, ESV, NABRE, GNT)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\). Most English versions and most Bible atlasesRasmussen p.244; Aharoni p, 257\. refer to the name of this town as Maralah.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> The border went west to the town of Maralah

**and met the brook east of Jokneam.**

* The border then went on to the stream near the town of Jokne\-am.
* Then it went on to the river valley near the town of Jokne\-am.

**met the brook east of Jokneam:** The phrase *the brook east of Jokneam* refers to a streambed that flowed with water in certain seasons. It was near the town of *Jokneam*.

**east:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *east* is more literally “on the face of.” There are two ways to interpret this word.

1. It means “near” or “opposite.” For example:

    > the ravine near Jokneam (NIV) *(NIV, NET, NASB, GW, NJPS, NJB, NABRE, CEV, KJV)*

2. It means “east.” For example:

    > the stream east of Jokneam (GNT) *(BSB, GNT, RSV, ESV, REB, NLT)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). We do not know for certain where the brook was in relation to Jokneam town. It is best to translate it using a word that means “near” or “close to.”

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> The border then went on to the streambed near the town of Jokne\-am

**From Sarid it turned eastward:** The description of the border returns to the starting point at the town of *Sarid*. The southern border is described as it went northeast along the foothills near Nazareth.Aharoni p. 257\.

**it turned eastward:** Although the Hebrew phrase is literally “eastward toward the sunrise,” in some languages it may be redundant to include both the term *eastward* and the phrase “toward the sunrise.” One of these terms may be left as implicit information. For example:

> From Sarid it turned eastward to the territory of Kisloth Tabor (NET)

**along the border of Chisloth\-tabor**

* up to the border of Chisloth\-tabor town.
* to the boundary of the town of Chisloth\-tabor.

**along the border of Chisloth\-tabor:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *border* also has the meaning of “territory.” Some English versions translate this term as “territory.” It is recommended that you translate this term as “boundary” or *border*.

**Chisloth\-tabor:** The term *Chisloth\-tabor* refers to a town. It was southeast of the town of Nazareth.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> up to the border of Chisloth\-tabor

* The clan of Asher also received the towns of Ebron and Rehob and Hammon and Kanah. Their land extended in the north to the important town of Sidon.

**It went on to Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah, as far as Greater Sidon:** The term *Ebron* is spelled “Abdon” in some Hebrew manuscripts and also in Joshua 21:30 and 1 Chronicles 6:59\. For this reason some English versions translate this term as “Abdon” here. It is recommended that you follow the major language version in your area when deciding which spelling to follow here.

**Greater Sidon:** The towns listed here were further north than those listed in the previous verse.Woudstra p. 289\. The town of *Greater Sidon* was an important Phoenician town which was on the Mediterranean Sea. The town of Sidon marked the northern limit of the land assigned to the clan of Asher.

**in the region of Achzib:** There is an interpretation issue with these two Hebrew words as they are not easy to understand. There are four ways to understand them.

1. It is two towns called “Mahalab” and *Achzib*. This is based on the Septuagint and also the parallel passage in Judges 1:31\. *(RSV, ESV, GW, REB, NJPS, NJB, NABRE, NLT, GNT)*
2. It is two towns called “Hebel” and *Achzib*. *(NET)*
3. The words mean “near Achzib.” For example:

    > in the region of Achzib (NIV) *(BSB, NIV, NASB)*

4. The words mean “from the coast to Achzib.” For example:

    > from the coast to Achzib (KJV) *(KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\) and translate it as “Mahalab, Achzib” the names of two towns. This is supported by many English versions, and by Bible commentaries.Woudstra p. 290\.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

Here are some other ways to translate this word:

> that

> in order that

**anyone who kills another unintentionally or accidentally:** The Hebrew phrase which the BSB translates as *unintentionally* can also be translated “by mistake” or “in error.” It means that the killer did not plan to kill the person.

**accidentally:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *accidentally* is more literally “without knowledge.” This is a synonym of the word “unintentionally.” It means that the killer did not plan to kill the person. Some languages may not have two words for this concept. In that case you may need to use only one word. For example:

> If any of you accidentally kills someone (GNT)

**may flee there:** The verb *flee* can also be translated “escape” or “run away.”

* If the relative who wants to kill him chases after him
* And if the relative who wants to get revenge follows after the killer,

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> He had not hated him in the past.

> and not because he was angry with him in the past

##### **General Comment on verse 20:5**

In the Hebrew and in the BSB verse 5 is a long sentence. It may be more natural in some languages to divide it into more than one sentence. For example:

**and until the death of the high priest serving at that time.**

* If he is innocent he must continue to stay there until the high priest of that time has died.
* If they decide that he is not guilty, he should live there until the chief priest in those days has died.

**until the death of the high priest serving at that time:** There is implicit information in this part of the verse. First the congregation must decide that the person who killed someone was innocent of murder. If they decided he was innocent he could stay in the town of refuge until the high priest died. It may be clearer in some languages to include this implicit information.

**high priest:** The *high priest* was the leader of all the priests. The priests offered sacrifices on behalf of the people, but the *high priest* offered certain sacrifices that no other priest could offer. He represented the Israelite people to God.

If you have translated the gospels you should translate *high priest* the same way you did there. See for example John 18:19\.

Here are some other ways to translate the term high priest:

> the chief/leader of all the priests

> the main/principal priest

> the highest/leading priest

**at that time:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *at that time* is more literally “in those days.” The high priest continued his duties until he died or could not carry them out. Then a new person was chosen.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> If he is innocent he must continue to stay there until the high priest of that time has died.

> After he is judged to be not guilty he should live there until the chief priest in those days has died.

**Then the manslayer may return to his own home:** This clause indicates that the person who killed unintentionally could then return to his home.

**in the city from which he fled:** *the city from which he fled* is the same town as is indicated in the phrase “to his own home.” In some languages it may be clearer to combine these two phrases. For example:

> to his own home in the town from which he fled

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Then the person who killed unintentionally may return to his own house in his town.

Joshua had told the men of the clans of Reuben, Gad and half the clan of Manasseh that they must help their fellow Israelites to conquer the land on the west side of the Jordan River (see Joshua 1:12–18\). Now they had conquered it with God’s help. They had fulfilled their obligation and so Joshua sent them home to where their families were living on the east side of the Jordan.

#### 22:1

**Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half\-tribe of Manasseh**

* ¶ Later, Joshua called together the people of the Reuben clan, the Gad clan, and half of the Manasseh clan.
* ¶ On another day, Joshua called the Reuben people, the Gad people and half of the Manasseh people to meet with him.

We do not know how much time passed between the events of chapter 21 and the events of chapter 22\. If the word *Then* in your language suggests that these events happened immediately after the events of chapter 22, it may be better to add a phrase such as:

**All this time you have not deserted your brothers:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *deserted* means to leave someone without intending to return to them. In some languages it may be more natural to state this in a positive sense. For example,

> For a long time you have supported your fellow Israelites. (NCV)

> It’s taken a long time, but you have stayed and helped your relatives. (CEV)

**All this time:** The phrase *All this time* refers to the time that the Israelites were fighting to conquer the land of Canaan. This was probably a period of several years.

**brothers:** The word *brothers* refers to the people of the other Israelite clans.

**has given your brothers rest:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *has given…rest* comes from the same verbal root as was used in 1:13\. It indicates that Yahweh gave the Israelites a place to settle and live in peace.

Joshua had told the men of the clans of Reuben, Gad and half the clan of Manasseh that they must help their fellow Israelites to conquer the land on the west side of the Jordan River (see Joshua 1:12–18\). Now they had conquered it with God’s help. They had fulfilled their obligation and so Joshua sent them home to where their families were living on the east side of the Jordan.

#### 22:6

* Then Joshua blessed them. He sent them on their way and they returned to their homes.
* Then Joshua blessed the men of those clans and told them they could go. They left to go home.

* Moses had given land to the half\-clan of Manasseh in the region of Bashan east of the Jordan River.
* One half of the clan of Manasseh had received land from Moses. That land was in the region of Bashan on the east side of the Jordan River.

The information in verse 22:7a–c is background information. The Hebrew conjunction that begins this sentence is usually translated “and.” Some translations translate it as “now” because this is a way to introduce background information in English. Some English versions including the BSB indicate this by putting the sentence in parentheses. Translate this Hebrew conjunction in a way that is natural in your language and shows that what follows is background information.

**To the half\-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given land in Bashan:** The author reminds the reader of information from chapter 1:12–15 and chapter 17:1–13\. Moses had given land to half of the clan of Manasseh on the east side of the Jordan River, but the other half of the people of the Manasseh clan received land on the west side of the river.

**To the half\-tribe of Manasseh:** The phrase *To the half\-tribe of Manasseh* is put at the beginning of the sentence in Hebrew to emphasize it. Use a word order that is natural in your language.

**had given land:** The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as *had given land* is more literally “Moses had given.” The BSB has supplied the word *land* to make the meaning clear in English.

**in Bashan:** *Bashan* was a region that was east of the Jordan River.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Moses had given land to the half\-clan of Manasseh in the region of Bashan east of the Jordan River

**and:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *and* indicates a contrast. It is a contrast between the two locations of land that the clan of Manasseh received.

**and to the other half:** The phrase *the other half* refers to the other half of the clan of Manasseh.

**Joshua gave land:** The Hebrew clause is more literally “Joshua had given.” The BSB has added the word *land* to make the meaning clear in English.

**on the west side of the Jordan among their brothers:** The phrase *among their brothers* indicates that half of the Manasseh clan’s land was next to the land that the other clans received on the west side of the Jordan River. The word *brothers* refers to the other Israelite clans.

**What is this breach of faith you have committed today against the God of Israel by turning away from the LORD and building for yourselves an altar, that you might rebel against the LORD this day?:** This is a long rhetorical question. It functions as a rebuke. The western clans rebuked the eastern clans for building the altar.

The BSB has translated this question as one long sentence. It may be more natural in some languages to translate it as two or more sentences. For example:

> Why have you done this evil thing against the God of Israel? You have rebelled against the Lord by building this altar for yourselves! You are no longer following him! (GNT)

**What is this breach of faith you have committed today against the God of Israel:** This is a rhetorical question that functions as a rebuke. The western clans rebuked the eastern clans for building the altar.

There are two ways to translate this question:

* As a rhetorical question. For example:

    > How could you break faith with the God of Israel like this? (NIV)

* As a statement. For example:

    > You have acted disloyally and sinned against the God of Israel.

    > You have turned against the God of Israel.

**by turning away from the LORD:** The Hebrew clause is more literally “turn back from after Yahweh.” This is a Hebrew idiom. It indicates that the western clans thought the eastern clans had stopped being faithful to Yahweh. Some languages may have a different idiom to express this meaning.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> you have turned your back on the Lord (CEV)

> Today you have stopped being faithful to Yahweh

> You have turned back from following Yahweh today

#### 22:16d

**and building for yourselves an altar, that you might rebel against the LORD this day?**

* Today you have built an altar for yourselves and rebelled against Yahweh.
* You have disobeyed Yahweh’s command and built an altar for yourselves.

**and building for yourselves an altar, that you might rebel against the LORD this day:** The Israelite leaders thought the clans of Reuben, Gad and the half\-clan of Manasseh had rebelled against Yahweh, because they had built an altar other than the one that was in the tent of meeting at Shiloh. This violated the command of Yahweh found in Leviticus 17:8–9\. They had acted against God’s Law and disobeyed him.

**this day:** The phrase *this day* means “today.”

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Today you have built an altar for yourselves and rebelled against Yahweh.

> How could you turn away from the Lord and build yourselves an altar in rebellion against him now? (NIV)

### Section 22:9–34 The eastern clans built an altar beside the Jordan River

Before the clans of Reuben, Gad and half the clan of Manasseh returned to their homes on the east side of the Jordan River, they built an altar beside the river on the west side. This made the clans on the west side of the river angry. They thought the clans from the east side were rebelling against Yahweh and being unfaithful to the covenant. When the clans from the east side explained their reason for building the altar, the other Israelites were pleased and stopped being angry.

#### 22:17–18a

**Was not the sin of Peor enough for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day? It even brought a plague upon the congregation of the LORD. And now, would you turn away from the LORD?:** This is a long rhetorical question. It functions as a rebuke.

There are two ways to translate this rhetorical question:

* As a rhetorical question. For example:

    > Was not the sin of Peor enough for us? Up to this very day we have not cleansed ourselves from that sin, even though a plague fell on the community of the Lord! And are you now turning away from the Lord? (NIV)

* As a statement. For example:

    > The sin we committed at Peor was bad enough. To this very day we have not purified ourselves; it even brought a plague on the community of the Lord. Now today you dare to turn back from following the Lord! (NET)

The BSB translates this rhetorical question as one long sentence. Many English versions translate it as two or three sentences. See the example of the NIV and the NET above. Translate this rhetorical question in the way that makes the meaning most clear in your language.

#### 22:17a

**Was not the sin of Peor enough for us,**

* Is the sin that the people of Israel committed at Peor a small thing to you?
* We(incl) Israel people sinned very wickedly at Peor,

**Was not the sin of Peor enough for us:** The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as *Was not the sin of Peor enough for us* is more literally “Was it (the sin of Peor) too little for us?

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Is the sin that Israel committed at Peor a small thing to you?

> The Israelites sinned at Peor and that was very bad.

**the sin of Peor enough for us:** The phrase *the sin of Peor* refers to the time when the people of Israel sacrificed to other gods and worshiped them. This event is recorded in Numbers 25:1–9\. The Israel men committed sexual acts with Moab women while they were camped at Shittim. These women invited them to sacrifice to their god, the Baal of Peor. Deuteronomy 4:3 says this happened at Baal Peor.

#### 22:17b

**from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day?**

* Even now we(incl) have not completely purified ourselves from that sin.
* and we still suffer from that sin up to the present day.

**from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day:** In some languages it may be more natural to begin a new sentence here.

**cleansed ourselves:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *cleansed ourselves* can also be translated “purified ourselves.” The people of Israel still felt ashamed when they thought of that sin. It may also mean that there were still some Israel people who wanted to worship Baal.Keil and Delitsch,v. 2 p.160\. Joshua alludes to this in 24:14–23\.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> We(incl) have still not completely purified ourselves from this sin

> We still suffer from that sin up to the present day

#### 22:17c

**It even brought a plague upon the congregation of the LORD.**

* Because of it, there was a plague in the community of Yahweh.
* A deadly disease struck the people of Yahweh because of it.

**It even brought a plague upon the congregation of the LORD:** In some languages it may be more natural to begin a new sentence here.

**plague:** A *plague* is a disease that spreads quickly and kills many people. A plague came and killed many Israel people when they sinned by worshiping the Baal god at Peor.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> there was a plague in the community of Yahweh

> a deadly disease struck the people of Yahweh

> a terrible disease fell upon the people of Yahweh

In some languages it may be helpful to repeat information to make the connection between the clauses clear. For example:

> because of it, there was a plague in the community of Yahweh

> a deadly disease struck the people of Yahweh because of it

**And now, would you turn away from the LORD?**

* And you(plur) also are turning back today from following Yahweh.
* Yet today you are not being faithful to Yahweh.

**And now, would you turn away from the LORD?:** This expression was used in verse 22:16\. You should translate it the same way as you did in that verse.

The plural pronoun *you* is emphatic. Some ways to show this emphasis are:

> and you(plur) also are turning back today from following Yahweh

> Yet today you too are not being faithful to Yahweh

#### 22:18b

**If you rebel today against the LORD,**

* Today you(plur) are rebelling against Yahweh!
* If you disobey Yahweh’s command today,

**If you rebel today against the LORD:** The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as *If you rebel today against the LORD* is more literally “and it will be, today you, you are rebelling against Yahweh.” The plural pronoun *you* is repeated to make it emphatic. It contrasts with “the whole congregation” in the next part of the verse.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Today it is you who are rebelling against Yahweh

> If you act against Yahweh’s command today,

* If your land is not a suitable place for worship,

**If indeed the land of your inheritance is unclean:** The people of the western clans implied that the land east of the Jordan was not pure because it was not Yahweh’s land. They thought Yahweh lived on their side of the river, where the Tent of Meeting was set up at Shiloh.Butler, p. 247\.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

* cross over into the land that belongs to Yahweh, where his holy tent is located.
* bring your families back to Yahweh’s land. This is where his dwelling place is.

**then cross over to the land of the LORD’s possession:** The clause *cross over to the land of the LORD’s possession* indicates that the people from the west side of the Jordan River were inviting the people on the east side to go and live with them.

**the land of the LORD’s possession:** The people of the western clans declared that the land on the west side of the Jordan River belonged to Yahweh because the Tent of Meeting was set up there, at Shiloh.

**where the LORD’s tabernacle stands:** The *tabernacle* was a tent, and the place where Yahweh lived. In 18:1 this place was referred to as “the Tent of Meeting.”

* and do not rebel against us. Do not build a different altar for yourselves besides the altar of Yahweh our God.
* or against us by building another altar. We already have the altar of Yahweh our God at the tent of meeting.

**or against us:** There is a textual issue in this part of the verse concerning the clause that the BSB translates “rebel…against us.”

1. The Hebrew Masoretic text reads “do not rebel against us.” *(BSB, NASB, NET, NIV, NRSV, GW, NJPS, NLT, CEV, KJV)*
2. Some translators change the vowels of the Hebrew verb so that it means “do not make us rebels.” *(RSV, ESV, NABRE, REB, NJB, GNT)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\). This follows the Hebrew text and is followed by many English versions.

**by building for yourselves an altar other than the altar of the LORD our God:** The phrase *the altar of the LORD our God* refers to the altar that was in the tent of meeting at Shiloh.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

* Remember how Achan the son of Zerah disobeyed the command about the things that belonged to Yahweh.
* When Achan the son of Zerah rebelled against Yahweh and did not destroy the things that must be destroyed,

**Was not Achan son of Zerah unfaithful regarding what was set apart for destruction:** This is a rhetorical question. It functions as a warning. There are two ways to translate this question:

* As a question. For example:

    > Achan son of Zerah acted unfaithfully concerning the things that belonged to Yahweh, didn’t he?

* As a statement. For example:

    > Remember how Achan son of Zerah refused to obey the command about things that must be destroyed. (ERV)

**Achan son of Zerah:** This person was first mentioned in 7:1\.

**unfaithful:** The Hebrew words that the BSB translates as *unfaithful* are the same words that occurred in verse 22:16 that the BSB translated as “breach of faith.” It means to act disloyally or unfaithfully. Achan did not keep the promise he made to Yahweh to obey his commands.

**regarding what was set apart for destruction:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *what was set apart* was first used in 6:17–18\. Yahweh said that these things belonged to him. The Israelites must not keep them. In 7:1 Achan stole some of these things and hid them. He and his family died because of that sin. It is recommended that you translate this Hebrew word in a similar way to how it was translated in 6:17 and 7:1\.

* “Our God is Yahweh, the mighty God. Our God is Yahweh, the mighty God.

**The LORD, the Mighty One, is God! The LORD, the Mighty One, is God:** The clans of Reuben, Gad and Manasseh answered by declaring firmly that they believe that Yahweh is the only true God.

There is an interpretation issue with the three Hebrew words that the BSB translates as *The LORD, the Mighty One, is God*.

1. The three terms are three separate names for God. *(BSB, RSV, ESV, NET, NIV, NASB, NLT, GNT)*
2. The second and third terms should be combined as a phrase: “God of Gods.” This is another way of saying that God is the mightiest God. *(NRSV, NABRE, REB, NJB, NJPS, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow option (1\) along with many English versions and several commentaries.Butler, p. 247–248, Woudstra, p. 327\. The people said three different names for God. Then they repeated them to indicate that they were faithful and loyal in following Yahweh.

**The LORD:** The term that the BSB translates as *The LORD* is the name Yahweh.

**the Mighty One:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *the Mighty One* is a Hebrew term for God that is most often used in combinations with other words. In Joshua 3:10 it is used in the phrase “the living God.” It is often used in Genesis with the Hebrew term that means mighty, as in Genesis 17:1\.

**If this was in rebellion or breach of faith against the LORD:** In some languages it may be more natural to use verbs rather than noun phrases. The Hebrew noun that the BSB translates as *breach of faith* is the same term that was used in verses 16 and 20\. It indicates that the people acted unfaithfully, or disloyally, toward Yahweh. They did not obey him.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Then your descendants might make our descendants stop worshiping Yahweh.

> If your descendants said that, they might stop our descendants from obeying Yahweh.

## Joshua 22:26 (id: 516846)

### Section 22:9–34 The eastern clans built an altar beside the Jordan River

Before the clans of Reuben, Gad and half the clan of Manasseh returned to their homes on the east side of the Jordan River, they built an altar beside the river on the west side. This made the clans on the west side of the river angry. They thought the clans from the east side were rebelling against Yahweh and being unfaithful to the covenant. When the clans from the east side explained their reason for building the altar, the other Israelites were pleased and stopped being angry.

#### 22:26

**That is why we said, ‘Let us take action and build an altar for ourselves, but not for burnt offerings or sacrifices.**

* So we(excl) said to each other, ‘Let’s build an altar. We will not offer burnt offerings or other sacrifices on it.
* That is why we decided to build an altar. It was not to make burnt offerings or other sacrifices.

**That is why:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *That is why* introduces a conclusion. Because of what might happen, the eastern people took this action. Use a connecting word that is natural in your language.

**we said:** The clause *we said* refers to the discussion that the eastern clans had with each other before they built the altar. It may be helpful to include the implicit information “to each other.”

**Let us take action and build an altar for ourselves, but not for burnt offerings or sacrifices:** This statement is in the form of a quotation. It may be more natural to rephrase it without a quotation. In that case the clause “we said” would be left untranslated. For example:

> So we decided to build this altar, not for burnt offerings and sacrifices (NET)

**burnt offerings:** This is the same term used in verse 23b.

**sacrifices:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *sacrifices* refers to offerings of animals that were burnt. It is a more general word for *sacrifices* than the word that is translated as “burnt offerings.”

Here are some other ways to translate this verse:

> So we said to each other, ‘Let’s build an altar. We will not offer burnt offerings or other sacrifices on it,

> That is why we decided to build an altar. It was not for offering burnt offerings or other sacrifices.

* On the contrary, it will remind us(excl) and you, and all of our descendants in the future
* But instead it will be a sign for you and for us, and for all the generations who are born after us

**Rather:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *Rather* shows a contrast. The altar was not for offerings, rather it was to be a witness. Use a word that is natural to show this contrast in your language.

Here are some other ways to show contrast in English:

> On the contrary (NIV)

> But instead (GNT)

**let it be a witness between us and you:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *witness* indicates that the altar was to be a proof or evidence. It was a sign that the eastern clans were still worshiping Yahweh. In some languages it may be more natural to translate the word *witness* as a verb rather than a noun.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> we built the altar to remind us and you (CEV)

> as a sign for our people and yours (GNT)

> it will help us all, our descendants and your descendants, to remember (EASY)

**and the generations to come:** This refers to their descendants who will be born in the future.

**that we will worship the LORD in His presence**

* that we worship in the presence of Yahweh.
* that we worship Yahweh where he dwells at the tent of meeting in Shiloh.

**that we will worship the LORD:** The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as *that we will worship the LORD* is more literally “to serve the service of Yahweh.” This phrase refers to the outward acts of worshiping Yahweh.Woudstra, p. 328\.

**in His presence:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *in His presence* is more literally “before his face.” Yahweh’s presence was at the tabernacle in Shiloh. In some languages it may be clearer to make this information explicit.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> that we worship Yahweh in his presence

#### 22:29a

**Far be it from us to rebel against the LORD**

* May it never happen that we(excl) rebel against Yahweh
* We most certainly will not disobey Yahweh

**Far be it from us to rebel against the LORD:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *Far be it from us* is an emphatic statement. It is a firm rejection of the idea that follows it. It indicates that the eastern clans will certainly never rebel against Yahweh. They will certainly not disobey him by offering sacrifices on another altar. If there is an idiomatic way to make an emphatic negative statement in your language, you may want to use it here.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

* ¶ It was a long time
* ¶ Many years went by

**A long time after:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *A long time after* is more literally “from many days.” There is an interpretation issue with this phrase.

1. It means that a long time passed after Israel was at peace. For example:

    > A long time passed after the Lord made Israel secure from all their enemies (NET) *(NET, REB, NCV, CEV, KJV)*

2. It means that a long time passed, and then Israel was at peace. For example:

* You yourselves have seen all that Yahweh our God has done for us. He helped us defeat all these enemy people.

**and you have seen:** The people of Israel had seen with their own eyes how God had defeated their enemies. The pronoun *you* is emphatic in Hebrew.

**everything that the LORD your God has done to all these nations:** This phrase indicates that Yahweh had defeated all the nations.

**for your sake:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *for your sake* is more literally, “from in front of you.” It means that Yahweh did everything in order to help the Israelites.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> on your behalf

> to help you

It may be clearer to change the pronoun reference to include Joshua:

> on our behalf

**See:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *See* calls attention to what is coming next. Some languages may have grammatical particles or markers that fulfill this function. Some English versions do not translate this word.

Here are some other ways to translate it in English:

> Look

> Remember

**I have allotted as an inheritance to your tribes these remaining nations:** The person who is speaking is Joshua. In chapters 14–21 he named the lands that each clan should inherit. This included many lands that they had not yet conquered.

**your:** The pronoun *your* is plural in Hebrew.

**these remaining nations:** The phrase *these remaining nations* refers to the lands of the people that Israel has not yet conquered.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

##### **General Comment on 23:4**

In some languages it may be more natural to reorder the parts of this verse. For example:

Here are some other ways to indicate this emphasis:

> Yahweh your God himself will push…

> Yahweh your God, he will push…

**push them out:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *push them out* can also be translated “force them to leave” or “drive them out.”

**of your way:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *of your way* is more literally “from your face.” It can also be translated “in front of you” or “ahead of you.” This indicates that Yahweh will cause the other nations to retreat as the Israelites move into their territory.

**before you:** The Hebrew prepositional phrase that the BSB translates as *before you* is more literally “from your face.” It is like the phrase that was used in verse 23:5a.

**so that you can take possession of their land:** Yahweh promised to take away the land from the other nations so that it could belong to the Israelites instead.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> He will drive them away in front of you, and you will own their land.

* just as Yahweh your God said to you.
* Yahweh our(incl) God promised us that he would do this.

**as the LORD your God promised you:** In some languages it may be clearer to translate the phrase *your God* as “our(incl) God” to show that Yahweh was Joshua’s God also.

**promised:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *promised* is more literally “spoke” or “said.”

* Do not make friends with the other peoples who still remain around you.

**So you are not to associate with these nations that remain among you:** The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as *not to associate with* is more literally “not enter into.” This indicates that the Israelites should not have anything to do with the non\-Israelites who still lived in the lands they had conquered.

**these nations that remain among you:** This indicates that there were non\-Israelite people who still lived in the land of Canaan because the Israelites had not yet conquered them.

Other English versions, such as the BSB, do not make this emphasis explicit. Show this emphasis in a way that is natural in your language.

**no one can stand against you:** The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as *no one can stand against you* is more literally “no man has stood before you until this day.” It indicates that none of their enemies had been able to defeat them. The Israelites had defeated all of them.

**because:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *because* can also be translated “since.” It introduces the reason why one Israelite soldier was able to make one thousand enemy soldiers run away.

**the LORD your God fights for you:** This clause uses the same words as verse 23:3b. The BSB translated the Hebrew participle “the one who fights” in the past tense in that verse (23:3\) because the context referred to what had already happened. It is translated in the present tense here because it refers to the pattern of how God operates. Use the tense or aspect that is natural in your language.

* Do not be unfaithful to him. Do not have anything to do with the peoples who are still left among you in the land.

**For:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *For* can also be translated as “because” or “but.” Use a connecting word that fits this context in your language.

**if:** The word *if* introduces a condition that is explained in verse 12\. The result is explained in verse 13\. If the Israelites associate with the other nations around them, then God will not drive those nations out.

**you turn away:** The Hebrew verb construction that the BSB translates as *turn away* indicates emphasis. Some English versions represent this emphasis. For example:

> But if you ever turn away (NET)

> If indeed you do go back (NKJV)

**turn away:** The expression *turn away* is an idiom that means to be disloyal or unfaithful.

Here are some other ways to translate this:

> For if you ever turn away from following him

> Because if you are at all disloyal to him

> Do not be unfaithful to him in any way

**and cling to the rest of these nations that remain among you:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates literally as *cling to* is the same verb that the BSB translated as “hold fast to” in verse 23:8\. It indicates that the Israelites should not have anything to do with the nations that still live in the land in which the Israelites settled. Instead, they should be faithful to Yahweh.

**the rest of these nations that remain among you:** This phrase is like the phrase in verse 23:7, but one more word is added at the beginning. The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *rest* can also be translated “what is left” or “what remains.”

#### 23:12b

**and if you intermarry and associate with them,**

* If you marry with them and you associate with them,
* Do not marry with them. Do not make friends with them.

**if you intermarry:** The Israelite people were not to marry the people of other nations.

**and associate with them:** There is an interpretation issue in this part of the verse. The Hebrew words are more literally “you go in them and they in you.”

1. The clause “you go in them and they in you” indicates association or friendship of people with each other. For example:

    > and you associate with them (NIV) *(BSB, NIV, ESV, NABRE, NET, GW, REB, NJPS, CEV, NASB)*

2. The clause “you go in them and they in you” indicates sexual intercourse and is another way to refer to marriage. For example:

    > and intermarry with them (GNT) *(GNT, RSV, NLT)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). This is supported by many English versions and Bible commentaries.Boling and Wright, p. 525, Woudstra, p. 337, footnote 6\.

* If you make friends with them, you can be sure that Yahweh your God will no longer take away the land from those peoples as you go forward.

**know for sure that the LORD your God will no longer drive out these nations before you:** Verse 12 started with the word “if” to indicate a condition. Verse 13 shows the result that will follow if the Israelites associate with the other nations around them. The Hebrew does not use the word “then” in verse 13\. In some languages it may help to say “then” to make it clear that this is a result.

**know for sure:** The Hebrew verb structure that the BSB translates as *know for sure* indicates emphasis. Look for a way to mark this emphasis if it is possible in your language.

* Instead, they will be like traps that catch you. They will be like a whip that beats your sides and like thorns that stick into your eyes.

**Instead:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *Instead* indicates a contrast. In some languages it may be more natural to begin a new sentence here.

**they will become for you a snare and a trap, a scourge in your sides and thorns in your eyes:** This is a series of metaphors that describe how dangerous the enemy nations will become to the Israelites.

**a snare and a trap:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *snare* refers to a net for catching birds. The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *trap* may refer to a wooden trap to catch birds, or it may refer to the bait inside the net which would lure the bird in. If you do not have two different words for bird traps you could say simply “a bird trap.”

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> a net and a trap

> a bird trap

> a trap

**a scourge:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *scourge* can also be translated “whip.”

**thorns in your eyes:** The phrase *thorns in your eyes* indicates that the enemy nations would damage the Israelites just as thorns damage the eyes.

In some languages it may be more natural to translate these metaphors as similes.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Rather, they will be a net or a trap for you, a whip on your side and thorns in your eyes.

> Instead, they will be like traps that catch you like a bird, like a whip that stings your sides and like thorns that stick in your eyes.

> they will be as dangerous for you as a trap. They will hurt you as much as a whip on your sides or thorns that stick into your eyes.

#### 23:13c

**until you perish from this good land that the LORD your God has given you.**

* They will torment you until you have all died. Then you will be gone from the good land that Yahweh your God has given you.
* Then none of you will be left in this good land which Yahweh your God has given you.

**until you perish from this good land that the LORD your God has given you:** This indicates that the enemy nations would inflict all those injuries on the Israelites until all of them had died.

**perish:** The English word *perish* is an older word that means “die.”

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> until you have all died and no longer live in the good land that Yahweh your God has given you

> In the end, none of you will be left in this good land that Yahweh your God has given you.

##### **General Comment on 23:12–13**

Verses 12 and 13 are a condition and a result.

> 12 If the Israelites associate with the other nations around them, 13then God will not drive those nations out.

This could also be expressed as a command with a warning.

> 12Do not associate with the other nations around you, 13otherwise God will not drive those nations out.

Joshua gave this farewell speech to the Israelites when he was near the end of his life. This section connects back to Joshua 13:1 which says that Joshua was very old, and to Joshua 21:44 which says that God had given the Israelites rest.Butler, p. 254\. The text does not say where Joshua gave this farewell speech, but it may have taken place at Shiloh.Woudstra, p. 332\.

#### 23:14a

**Now behold, today I am going the way of all the earth,**

* ¶ Look, I will soon die, just like everyone does.
* ¶ Pay attention. I will not live much longer.

**Now:** The connector that the BSB translates as *Now* is the Hebrew conjunction that joins sentences. Many English versions do not translate this connecting word. Use a connecting word that is natural in your language.

**behold:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *behold* calls attention to the next statement. Some languages may have grammatical markers that fulfill this function.

Here are some other ways to translate this word:

> Look

> Pay attention (GW)

**I am going the way of all the earth:** This is a Hebrew idiom which means that Joshua will soon die.

Here are some other ways to translate this idiom:

> I will soon die, like everyone else does

> I will not live much longer

#### 23:14b

**and you know with all your heart and soul**

* You(plur) know in your hearts
* Each one of you truly knows this:

**and you know with all your heart and soul:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *you know* is plural. It refers to all the Israelites.

**your heart and soul:** The phrase *your heart and soul* is a Hebrew idiom that refers to the entire being of a person. In this context it emphasizes the completeness of their knowledge.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> You(plur) know in your hearts and in your souls

> You(plur) know with all your being

**that not one of the good promises the LORD your God made to you has failed.**

* that none of the good words that Yahweh your God promised you has failed to happen.
* not one of the promises that Yahweh your God gave to you has failed to come true.

**that not one of the good promises the LORD your God made to you has failed:** The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as *not one of the good promises the LORD your God made to you has failed* is more literally “not one thing has fallen.” In some languages it may be more natural to express this in a positive statement. For example, “Everything has happened.”

**not one of the good promises the LORD your God made to you:** Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> none of the good words that Yahweh your God has spoken concerning you has failed to happen

> Every one of the promises that Yahweh your God gave to you has happened

#### 23:14d

**Everything was fulfilled for you; not one promise has failed.**

* All his words have been fulfilled. None have failed to happen.
* Every single one of the promises that he gave to you has come true.

**Everything was fulfilled for you:** This means that every word or promise that Yahweh has spoken to them has happened.

**not one promise has failed:** The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as *not one promise has failed* is more literally “not one word has fallen from them.”

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> All his promises have been fulfilled. None have failed to happen.

> Every single one of the words he spoke to you has come true.

##### **General Comment on 23:14c–d**

The negative and positive statements in 14c and 14d mean the same thing. The repetition functions to emphasize that nothing that Yahweh has promised has failed to happen. Every promise he made has come true. Use a natural way in your language to indicate this emphasis.

**But just as every good thing the LORD your God promised you has come to pass,**

* But, just as all the good things that he promised you(plur) have happened,
* All the good promises that Yahweh your God spoke to you have come true. But if you do not obey him

**But:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *But* indicates a contrast. God has blessed them, but if they disobey him, he will curse them. Some English versions do not translate this conjunction. Use a connecting word that is natural in your language.

**just as:** The Hebrew prepositional phrase that the BSB translates as *just as* introduces a comparison. It connects with the word “likewise” in 15b.

> 15a Just as God has given good things to them, 15blikewise he will give evil things to them if they break their covenant with him.

**every good thing the LORD your God promised you:** This clause uses almost the same Hebrew words as the clause in 23:14c.

**has come to pass:** The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as *has come to pass* is more literally “have come upon you.”

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> But, in the same way that all the promises Yahweh your God made to you have happened…

> All the good promises that Yahweh your God spoke to you have come true. In the same way…

#### 23:15b

**likewise the LORD will bring upon you the calamity He has threatened,**

* so he will cause every evil thing to happen to you.
* he will make every judgment that he warned you about come true as well.

**likewise:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *likewise* introduces the second part of the comparison.

**the LORD will bring upon you the calamity He has threatened:** Here are some other ways to translate the word *calamity*:

> judgments (NET)

> threat (GNT)

> warnings (NASB)

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> so also Yahweh will cause every evil thing to happen

#### 23:15c

**until He has destroyed you from this good land He has given you.**

* He will destroy you, and you will no longer live in this good land that he has given to you.
* That will happen until he has destroyed you and none of you is left in this good land which he had given you.

**until He has destroyed you from this good land He has given you:** This part of the verse is like verse 23:13c. In that verse the Hebrew verb that means “die” is used. In this verse the Hebrew verb that means “destroy” is used. Some English versions such as GNT do not translate this clause because the information was already stated in that verse.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> until he has destroyed you. Then you will no longer live in this good land that Yahweh your God has given to you.

> That will happen until he has destroyed you and none of you is left in this good land that he has given you.

**If you transgress the covenant of the LORD your God, which He commanded you,**

* If you(plur) do not obey the covenant of Yahweh your God that he commanded you to follow,
* Yahweh your God commanded you to obey the laws of the agreement he made with you. If you do not obey them,

Some English versions continue the sentence from verse 23:15a. It is a very long sentence. You may find that it is more natural to begin a new sentence here like the BSB.

**If you transgress the covenant of the LORD your God:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *transgress the covenant* indicates that someone has not obeyed the covenant. The term *covenant* was first mentioned in the book of Joshua in 3:3\. Look to see how you translated this term in that verse.

**which He commanded you:** Yahweh had commanded the Israelites to obey the covenant that he had made with them. It may be more natural to include implicit information:

> which he commanded you to obey

In some languages it may be more natural to have two sentences. For example,

> Yahweh your God commanded you to obey his covenant. If you disobey it,

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> This will happen if you do not obey the covenant of Yahweh your God, which he commanded you to follow,

> Yahweh your God commanded you to obey the laws of the agreement he made with you. If you do not,

#### 23:16b

**and go and serve other gods and bow down to them,**

* but you serve and bow down to worship other gods,
* but you honor and worship other gods,

**and go and serve other gods:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *serve* indicates that the Israelites might worship other gods and honor them.

**and bow down to them:** This indicates that someone is bowing down in worship.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> and you serve and bow down in worship to other gods,

> and you honor and worship other gods,

#### 23:16c

**then the anger of the LORD will burn against you,**

* then Yahweh will become angry with you.
* he will be angry with you.

**then:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *then* is the Hebrew conjunction that connects sentences. In this context it indicates the result. This is what will happen if the Israelites follow other gods instead of Yahweh. Use a connecting word that is natural in your language to indicate a result.

**the anger of the LORD will burn against you:** This is more literally “the anger of Yahweh will burn in you.” It is a Hebrew idiom which indicates that Yahweh will be angry with the Israelites.

Here is another way to translate this part of the verse:

> then Yahweh will be angry with you

#### 23:16d

**and you will quickly perish from this good land He has given you.”**

* You will all die quickly and will no longer live in the good land that he has given you.”
* Then none of you will be left in this good land that he has given you. Very soon you will all be dead.”

**and you will quickly perish from this good land He has given you:** This is the same phrase as verse 23:13c, except that the word *quickly* is added. It may be helpful to add implicit information here. The Israelites would die quickly because Yahweh would punish them. For example:

> then in his anger he will punish you, and soon none of you will be left in this good land that he has given you (GNT)

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> until you have all quickly died and you no longer live in the good land that Yahweh your God has given you

> Then none of you will be left in this good land that Yahweh your God has given you. You will all soon be dead.

##### **General Comment on 23:16**

Although some English versions begin a sentence at verse 16c, the BSB and many English versions start the sentence at the beginning of verse 16\. For example:

> If you violate the covenant of the Lord your God, which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods and bow down to them, the Lordʼs anger will burn against you, and you will quickly perish from the good land he has given you. (NIV)

**Then Joshua assembled all the tribes of Israel at Shechem.**

* ¶ Sometime later Joshua called all the clans of Israel to come together at Shechem town.
* ¶ After that, Joshua sent for all the clans of Israel to gather at Shechem town.

**Then:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *Then* introduces the next event in the storyline. It is not certain how much time had passed between chapter 23 and chapter 24\. It is recommended that you use an indefinite marker of time. Some English versions do not use a time marker here.

Here are some other ways to introduce this paragraph:

> Afterwards

> Sometime later

**Joshua assembled all the tribes of Israel at Shechem:** The clause *Joshua assembled all the tribes of Israel* indicates that Joshua sent a message to all the people of Israel asking them to come and meet together.

**the tribes of Israel:** The *tribes of Israel* refers to all the people who were descended from the twelve sons of Jacob. They all shared a common culture and language. Choose a translation of the word “tribe” that reflects this kind of relationship.

**Shechem:** The town of *Shechem* was mentioned in 17:7\.

**He summoned the elders, leaders, judges, and officers of Israel,**

* He called the leaders, the heads of families, the judges, and the officers.
* He sent for their clan leaders, their family leaders, their judges, and their officials.

The Hebrew begins with a conjunction that is usually translated as “and.” However, in some languages it may be more natural to begin a new sentence here like the BSB.

**He summoned the elders, leaders, judges, and officers of Israel:** This list of terms is like the list in 23:2a. Translate these terms the same way in both places.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

#### 24:1c

**and they presented themselves before God.**

* They came and stood before God.
* They came and stood in the presence of God.

* ‘Long ago your(plur) ancestors lived on the east side of the Euphrates River. This included Terah, the father of Abraham and Nahor. They worshiped other gods.
* ‘A long time ago your ancestors lived way over there on the other side of the Euphrates River. This included Terah, who was the father of Abraham and Nahor. They worshiped gods other than Yahweh.

**your fathers:** The phrase *your fathers* refers to the ancestors of the Israelite people.

**Terah the father of Abraham and Nahor:** *Terah* was an important ancestor of the Israelite people. He was the father of Abraham, whom God called to leave his country and form a new nation.

**lived beyond the Euphrates:** The word *lived* indicates that these people lived a long time ago.

**beyond the Euphrates:** Their ancestors lived on the east side of the Euphrates River. Joshua and the people were now far away from the Euphrates River on its west side.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> Long ago your ancestors lived on the east side of the Euphrates River.

> A long time ago your ancestors lived way over there on the other side of the Euphrates River.

**and worshiped other gods:** The clause *and worshiped other gods* indicates that Terah as well as other ancestors of the Israelites did not worship Yahweh. They worshiped other, different, gods.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

**I took your father Abraham from beyond the Euphrates:** Yahweh led Abraham away from his former country, which was on the east side of the Euphrates River. This place was mentioned in verse 2\.

**I:** God is speaking here. The person who said *I* is God, not Joshua.

**and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau.**

* To Isaac I gave two sons: Jacob and Esau.
* and I gave to Isaac his sons Jacob and Esau.

**and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau:** The BSB has placed the indirect object, *Isaac*, first in the sentence in order to emphasize it. The Hebrew text has normal Hebrew word order: “I gave to Isaac Jacob and Esau.” Translate this sentence using the word order that is natural in your language.

Here is another way to translate this part of the verse:

> I gave Isaac two sons: Jacob and Esau.

#### 24:4b

**I gave Esau Mount Seir to possess,**

* I gave his son Esau the mountain country of Seir to live in.
* I gave Esau the hilly region of Edom for his own,

The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB leaves untranslated but other English versions translate as “and” introduces the next event in the storyline.

**I gave Esau Mount Seir to possess:** The *Mount Seir* refers to the land that Esau and his descendants lived in. It was south of the Dead Sea. This land is often called “Edom,” and you may wish to translate it that way. See how you translated the term *Seir* in Joshua 11:17\.

**but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt.**

* But Jacob and his children went to live in Egypt.
* but Jacob and his family went to the land of Egypt.

**but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *went down* indicates descending to a lower elevation. If the grammar of your language does not keep track of elevation, it may be more natural to translate it as “went.”

**Then I sent Moses and Aaron,**

* Later I sent Moses and Aaron to help the Israelites.
* Many years after that I sent Moses and his brother Aaron to Egypt.

**Then:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Then* introduces the next event in the storyline. Introduce this next event in a way that is natural in your language.

**I sent Moses and Aaron:** Many years passed between the time that Jacob and his family went to Egypt, and the time that Yahweh sent Moses and Aaron to meet the king of Egypt. It may be helpful to add this implicit information at the beginning of the verse. For example,

> Later I sent Moses and Aaron (GNT)

> Many years after that, I sent Moses and Aaron

The clause *I sent Moses and Aaron* does not state where Yahweh sent them or what Yahweh sent them to do. In some languages it may be helpful to include some of this implicit information. For example:

> I sent Moses and Aaron to help the Israelites

> I sent Moses and his brother Aaron to Egypt

#### 24:5b

**and I afflicted the Egyptians by what I did there,**

* I struck the people of Egypt with the disasters that I caused there.
* I made terrible things happen to the Egyptian people.

**and I afflicted the Egyptians by what I did there:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *afflicted* is more literally “hit.” In this context it refers to the disasters that God caused the Egyptians to suffer. The disasters that God brought upon the Egyptians are recorded in Exodus 7–11\.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> I struck the people of Egypt with the disasters that I caused there

#### 24:6a

**When I brought your fathers out of Egypt**

* When I brought your(plur) ancestors out of the land of Egypt
* After I led your ancestors out from the land of Egypt

**When I brought your fathers out of Egypt:** The information in this part of the verse is the same as the information in 24:5\. The phrase *your fathers* refers to the ancestors of the Israelites to whom Joshua was speaking. It may be more natural to include the information *out of Egypt* in verse 5c and leave that information implicit here.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> When I brought your forefathers out of Egypt

> When I led your ancestors out

#### 24:6b

**and you reached the Red Sea,**

* you reached the Red Sea.
* then you arrived at the Red Sea.

**and you reached the Red Sea:** In verses 6 and 7 Joshua sometimes used the term “your fathers” and sometimes used the pronoun *you*, speaking to the Israelites. In some languages it may not be natural to alternate in this way. In that case, you may choose to refer only to the Israelite ancestors, using the pronoun “they.” For example:

> I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, and the Egyptians pursued them with chariots and cavalry. But when your ancestors got to the Red Sea they cried out to me for help, and I put darkness between them and the Egyptians. I made the sea come rolling over the Egyptians and drown them. You know what I did to Egypt. (GNT)

**the Red Sea:** In the Hebrew this was more literally “the sea.” It may be more natural in your language to identify it here as the *Red Sea* as the BSB did.

Here is another way to translate this part of the verse:

> you arrived at the Red Sea

> you came to the sea. (RSV)

#### 24:6c

##### **General Comment on 24:7**

This verse contains an implicit event. Before Yahweh made the Egyptians drown in the Red Sea, he had made the sea stand up like a wall. Then the Israelites were able to walk on a dry path through the sea to the other side. Some English versions add this implicit information so that the sequence of events is clear to the readers. For example:

> Your people cried to me for help, so I put a dark cloud between them and the Egyptians. Then I opened up the sea and let your people walk across on dry ground. But when the Egyptians tried to follow, I commanded the sea to swallow them, and they drowned while you watched. (CEV)

    > As you advanced, I threw them into panic. (GNT) *(NET, GNT, REB, CEV, NLT, NJPS, NCV)*

2. It means hornet. For example:

    > I sent the hornet before you (ESV) *(BSB, ESV, RSV, NASB, NIV, GW, NABRE, NJB, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). This is the interpretation recommended by most Bible commentariesSee for example Walton p. 83–84, and Dallaire p, 1038\. and the one taken by many English versions.

1. It refers to the two kings of the Amorites. For example:

    > I sent terror ahead of you to drive out before you the two Amorite kings (NET) *(BSB, NET, RSV, NRSV, ESV, REB, NASB, NCV, NLT, NJPS, NJB, GNT, GW)*

    > I made your enemies panic and run away, as I had done with the two Amorite kings east of the River Jordan. (CEV) *(CEV, NIV, KJV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). This is followed by most English versions and Bible commentaries.

* Yahweh our God is the one who brought us and our fathers up from the land of Egypt.
* All these things have come to us because of Yahweh our God. He led us and our parents and grandparents out of the land of Egypt.

**For:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates *For* introduces a reason. Here the people explained the reason why they would be faithful to Yahweh.

**the LORD our God brought us and our fathers out of the land of Egypt:** The Hebrew construction puts emphasis on the words “Yahweh our God.” This emphasizes the role of Yahweh as the one who saved them.

**brought us and our fathers out:** The word *fathers* refers to the parents and grandparents of the people who were standing there with Joshua.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

**And:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *And* introduces the next event in the storyline. Introduce the next event in a natural way in your language.

**the LORD drove out before us all the nations, including the Amorites who lived in the land:** There is an interpretation issue concerning the phrase *all the nations, including the Amorites*

1. It refers to the Amorites. The entire phrase refers to the same group of people. For example:

    > the Lord drove out all the Amorites who lived here (GNT) *(GNT, RSV, ESV, NASB, NJPS, NCV, KJV)*

2. It refers to other nations as well as to the Amorites. For example:

    > And the Lord drove out before us all the nations, including the Amorites, who lived in the land. (NIV) *(BSB, NIV, NET, GW, REB, NABRE, NJB, NLT, CEV)*

It is recommended that you choose interpretation (1\). This is supported by several Bible commentaries as well as many English versions.

* “I think that you(plur) will not be able to serve Yahweh,
* “It is not easy to worship and obey Yahweh,

**You are not able to serve the LORD:** The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as *You are not able to serve the LORD* is more literally “you will not be able to serve Yahweh.” Joshua warned the people to think carefully about what it meant to serve Yahweh. It would not be easy to obey and worship him.

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

**for He is a holy God; He is a jealous God;**

* because he is a holy God. He will not allow you to worship other gods.
* because he is a holy God. He is God, and he wants you to serve him only.

**for He is a holy God:** The clause *He is a holy God* states the first reason why it would be difficult to serve Yahweh. He is a completely pure God who is set apart from all others. This is the first time in the book of Joshua that the term *holy* is used regarding God. Consider the way you translated the word *holy* when you said “Holy Spirit” in the New Testament.

**He is a jealous God:** This is the second reason why it would be difficult to serve Yahweh. The clause *He is a jealous God* indicates that God demands that the Israelites worship only him.

**He will not forgive your rebellion or your sins.**

* He will not forgive you if you rebel and sin against him.
* He will not forgive you when you turn away from him and do wrong.

**He will not forgive your rebellion or your sins:** The Hebrew words that the BSB translates as *rebellion* and *sins* both refer to breaking the commands of God. Some languages may have only one word for this. In that case it may be more natural to translate using one word only. For example:

> he…will not forgive your sins (GNT)

Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:

> He will not forgive you if you rebel and sin against him.

> He will not forgive you if you turn away from him and sin.

**If you forsake the LORD and serve foreign gods,**

* If you(plur) abandon Yahweh and worship gods of other nations
* If you turn away from Yahweh to obey other gods

**If you forsake the LORD and serve foreign gods:** These words are similar to the words in verse 24:16\. In that verse the phrase “other gods” is used. Here the phrase *foreign gods* is used. Both these phrases refer to gods other than Yahweh.

You may be able to translate this clause in a similar way in both places.

The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB leaves untranslated but some English versions translate as “then” introduces the consequences of the previous clause.

**He will turn:** The clause *He will turn* indicates that Yahweh would turn against the Israelites. He would no longer help them.

**bring disaster on you and consume you:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *consume* can also be translated “bring to an end” or “destroy.” This part of the verse is similar to verse 23:15\.

* ¶ Then the people answered Joshua, “No, we(excl) will not serve other gods. It is Yahweh whom we will serve.”
* ¶ But the people told Joshua, “We will never serve other gods. We will honor and obey only Yahweh.”

The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB leaves untranslated but some English versions translate as “and” introduces the next event in the storyline. Introduce the next event in a way that is natural in your language.

**“No!” replied the people:** The people answered “No, we will not serve other gods.” They were accepting Joshua’s advice. They were not rejecting it. You may need to add some words to make the meaning clear.

**We will serve the LORD!:** The Hebrew words that the BSB translates as *We will serve the LORD* are more literally “but Yahweh we will serve.” The Hebrew sentence puts the word “Yahweh” at the front to indicate emphasis. Use a natural way in your language to mark this emphasis.

**Then:** The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *Then* introduces the next event in the storyline. Introduce the next event in a natural way in your language.

**You are witnesses against yourselves:** There is an interpretation issue with the Hebrew preposition that the BSB translates as *against*.

1. It means against. This indicates that the Israelites will be asked in the future to testify whether they have kept their covenant with Yahweh. If they have not kept the covenant, they will have to testify that they are wrong. For example:

    > Do you agree to be witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen to worship the Lord? (NET) *(BSB, NET, RSV, ESV, NIV, NABRE, NASB, REB, NJPS, KJV)*

2. It means for or about. This indicates that the Israelites are affirming that they have said that they will serve Yahweh. It does not imply any consequences for the future. For example:

    > You have testified that you have chosen to serve the Lord. (GW) *(GW, GNT, NLT, NCV, NJB, CEV)*

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\). This is followed by many English versions and Bible commentaries.

* He said, “Then throw away all the gods that you(plur) still have,
* Joshua told them, “Destroy any foreign gods that you still have with you.

**“Now, therefore,” he said:** The Hebrew text does not have the words *he said*. The BSB had supplied these words to indicate that Joshua was speaking again. In your translation, make it clear that Joshua is speaking.

The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as *Now, therefore* introduces a conclusion from the previous paragraphs. Because of their commitment, the people must put away their other gods. Introduce this conclusion in a way that is natural in your language.

**get rid of the foreign gods among you:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *get rid of* was translated as “cast aside" in verse 24:14\.

**foreign gods:** The phrase *foreign gods* refers to all gods besides Yahweh. They were the gods of other foreign nations.

**Joshua made a covenant for the people:** The term *covenant* was first mentioned in the book of Joshua in 3:3\. It was also used in 23:16\. You will probably be able to translate it the same way in all three places.

**for the people:** The Hebrew preposition that the BSB translates as *for* can also be translated “with.” Joshua did not make an agreement between the people and himself. Instead, he acted as Yahweh’s representative. He established a covenant between the people and Yahweh.

**Shechem:** The town of *Shechem* was mentioned in verse 24:1\.

**in the Book of the Law of God:** The *Book of the Law of God* refers to the book, or scroll, in which Joshua wrote down the laws that he received from God for them.Woudstra p. 357–358\. The people of that time wrote things on scrolls rather than in books. Some English versions use the word scroll. For example:

* He set a large stone on its end under the oak tree near the place that was set apart to worship Yahweh.

**Then he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak:** In many languages it may be more natural to begin a new sentence here. The clause *set it up* indicates that Joshua stood the large stone up on its end.

> He erected a big stone

> He stood a big stone on its end

**Then:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *Then* introduces the next event in the storyline. Introduce the next event in a natural way in your language.

**oak:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *oak* is found only in this verse. It refers to a kind of tree, but scholars do not agree on what kind of tree it was. Some English versions translate this word as “terebinth,” which is a tree in the cashew family.

Here are some ways to translate this word:

> oak (BSB, RSV, NET, NASB, NIV, GW, NJPS, GNT, CEV, NCV, NJB, KJV)

> Look at this stone

**this stone. It will be a witness against us:** In verse 24:22 Joshua told the Israelites that they would be witnesses against themselves in the future. In this verse he told them that the stone he had set up would also be *a witness*. He said it was a witness *against us* because he was including himself with the other Israelites.

**and:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *and* connects sentences. Many English versions do not translate this word here. Use a connecting word if there is a natural one in your language.

**it will be a witness against you:** This sentence uses almost the same words as in part b of this verse. Joshua repeated his statement to emphasize it. However, in this part of the verse he used the pronoun *you* instead of “us.”

**if you ever deny your God:** The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as *deny* can also be translated “betray” or “be unfaithful.”
