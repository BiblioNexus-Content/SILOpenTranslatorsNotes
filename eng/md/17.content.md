## Esther 1:1 (id: 513155)

### Section 1:1–9: King Xerxes gave a big feast

This section describes the setting for the story. It begins with a description of the Persian Empire and the feast which King Xerxes held in the third year of his reign to show his people how rich he was.

#### 1:1a

**This is what happened in the days of Xerxes,**

* ¶ The following story/events took place while Xerxes was king.

**This is what happened:** In Hebrew, the story begins with a word which many versions do not translate at all (see 1:1 in GNT, CEV). If you have a special way in your language to indicate the beginning of a story, you should use it here.

**Xerxes:** Xerxes was the king of the Persian Empire from 485–464 BC. Xerxes was his name in Greek. In the Hebrew text, his name is given as Ahasuerus and a number of English versions use this form (KJV, NJPS, RSV). You should follow the English version most commonly used in your area.

#### 1:1b

**who reigned over 127 provinces**

* This was the Xerxes who was king over 127 regions/districts/areas.

**provinces:** The Persian Empire was so large that it was divided into 127 districts, called provinces in the BSB. The king appointed officials in each province so that the whole empire could be governed well.

#### 1:1c

**from India to Cush.**

* He ruled over the countries/lands from the country of India in the east to the country of Ethiopia in the west.
* He ruled over India and Ethiopia and everywhere in between.

**India:** This was the same area as present day India and was the part of the Persian Empire furthest to the east.

**Cush:** This referred to the upper Nile region which today is known as Ethiopia. It was the part of the Persian Empire furthest to the west.

* **Associated Passages:** EST 1:1

## Esther 1:2 (id: 513157)

### Section 1:1–9: King Xerxes gave a big feast

This section describes the setting for the story. It begins with a description of the Persian Empire and the feast which King Xerxes held in the third year of his reign to show his people how rich he was.

#### 1:2

**In those days King Xerxes sat on his royal throne in the citadel of Susa.**

* At the time this story took place he was governing the empire from his palace in the city of Susa.

**his royal throne:** A *throne* is the special seat on which a king would sit, especially on special occasions when he was meeting with officials or other visitors. It may have been decorated with or even made of gold. Here, however, it is used in a figurative way and refers only to the fact that he was king. The Display shows one way of translating this meaning.

**citadel of Susa:** There were three major cities in the empire, and the king had a palace in each one. This story took place in the city of Susa, where the king lived during the winter. The Hebrew word which the BSB translates *citadel* means “palace, fortress” and refers to a part of the city which was raised above the rest of the city and fortified with high walls against attack. The king’s palace would probably have been inside this fortified area.

Here are some other ways to translate *citadel*:

> capital city (GNT, CEV)

> important city

> capital city

## Esther 1:3 (id: 513160)

### Section 1:1–9: King Xerxes gave a big feast

This section describes the setting for the story. It begins with a description of the Persian Empire and the feast which King Xerxes held in the third year of his reign to show his people how rich he was.

### Paragraph 1:3–4

The king displayed his riches to the officials of his kingdom for six months. During this time he may have been planning the battles against Greece which took place from 482–479 BC. At the end of the six months, he gave a huge feast for his officials and the public which lasted for a week.

#### 1:3a

**In the third year of his reign, Xerxes held a feast for all his officials and servants.**

* ¶ During the third year that he was king, he gave a big feast for all the officials/administrators and other important men in his kingdom.

**officials:** This is the first of five groups of important people mentioned in this verse as guests at the banquet. The word in Hebrew which the BSB translates *officials* is a general term for a leader or other important person and refers to someone whom the king has appointed to that position.

**servants:** Literally “servants/slaves.” Here it does not refer to ordinary servants but those of high rank. The BSB has *servants*; GNT has “administrators.”

If you translate “officials” as “important people,” you may want to switch the two terms and say, for example, “administrators and other important people.”

#### 1:3b

**The military leaders of Persia and Media were there, along with the nobles and princes of the provinces.**

* The people the king invited to the feast were the army chiefs of Persia and Media, and the governors and other important men in his provinces.

Three more groups of leaders are mentioned in this part of the verse. However, this was probably just another way of referring to the same people as in 1:3a. This is how the Display has linked the two parts of the verse.

**military leaders:** This is literally “armies.” However, it is more likely that the term refers here only to the army chiefs, not to all the soldiers (as BSB, NIV, RSV, NCV, CEV), and it is recommended that you translate it in this way.

**Persia and Media:** The Persian Empire was made up of these two kingdoms, which were ruled by the same king.

**nobles:** The Hebrew word here refers to important officials, governors ruling over a district or province.

**princes:** This is the same word that was translated “officials” in 1:3a.

## Esther 1:4 (id: 513162)

### Section 1:1–9: King Xerxes gave a big feast

This section describes the setting for the story. It begins with a description of the Persian Empire and the feast which King Xerxes held in the third year of his reign to show his people how rich he was.

### Paragraph 1:3–4

The king displayed his riches to the officials of his kingdom for six months. During this time he may have been planning the battles against Greece which took place from 482–479 BC. At the end of the six months, he gave a huge feast for his officials and the public which lasted for a week.

#### 1:4

**And for a full 180 days he displayed the glorious riches of his kingdom and the magnificent splendor of his greatness.**

* The celebrations lasted six months. During all that time he showed them his great riches and all the beautiful and splendid things which showed how great a king he was.

**the magnificent splendor:** This refers to the magnificent possessions of the king.

**his greatness:** This refers to his position as king.

* **Associated Passages:** EST 1:4

## Esther 1:5 (id: 513163)

### Section 1:1–9: King Xerxes gave a big feast

This section describes the setting for the story. It begins with a description of the Persian Empire and the feast which King Xerxes held in the third year of his reign to show his people how rich he was.

#### 1:5a

**At the end of this time,**

* ¶ At the end of the six months,

**At the end of this time:** That is, at the end of the six months.

#### 1:5b

**in the garden court of the royal palace, the king held a seven\-day feast**

* the king held another big feast in the enclosed gardens surrounding his palace. This feast lasted seven days.

**garden court:** This means an area outside where there were grass, trees and flowers, and possibly paved areas. It does not mean a place where food is grown. It was probably surrounded by hedges or walls. The BSB states this explicitly by saying *garden court*.

Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:

> enclosed garden (NIV)

> courtyard (NCV)

**the royal palace:** The Hebrew word which the BSB translates *palace* probably refers to a small building apart from the main palace buildings. It was a roof set on columns to shelter people from the sun, but allowing the breezes to pass through.

**the king held a seven\-day feast:** It isn’t clear whether this refers to another banquet or the same banquet as the one mentioned in 1:3\. In those days, banquets could last as long as six months. However, it is more logical in the context to understand it to mean a separate banquet which was held at the end of the six months. CEV and NCV have stated that meaning explicitly by adding “another.”

#### 1:5c

**for all the people in the citadel of Susa, from the least to the greatest.**

* He invited everyone from the city of Susa to the feast, rich and poor alike.

**in the citadel of Susa:** See note on 1:2\.

**from the least to the greatest:** This was a way of including everyone. *least* probably refers to the poorest and *greatest* to the richest in this context.

## Esther 1:6 (id: 513165)

### Section 1:1–9: King Xerxes gave a big feast

This section describes the setting for the story. It begins with a description of the Persian Empire and the feast which King Xerxes held in the third year of his reign to show his people how rich he was.

#### 1:6

This verse describes how the garden was decorated. There were marble pillars around the edge of the garden. Blue and white curtains were hung between these pillars and were tied to silver rings on the pillars by purple and white cords. Blue and white were the royal colors of Persia. The meaning of many of the Hebrew words in this verse is not known and that is why there are many differences in detail between the English versions.

#### 1:6a

**Hangings of white and blue linen were fastened**

* There were curtains made of white and blue fine material in the garden.

**Hangings of white and blue linen:** This probably refers to two separate sets of curtains, one set blue and the other white, not two\-colored curtains.

**linen:** This is a finely woven cloth made from the flax plant.

#### 1:6b

**with cords of fine white and purple material to silver rings on the marble pillars.**

* These were attached by cords to silver rings on pillars made of beautiful stone. These cords were made from white linen cloth and purple material.

**purple:** Purple is a color between red and blue.

**silver rings:** This could refer to:

1. rings made of silver which were attached to or embedded in the pillars (BSB, NIV, GNT, NCV, CEV).
2. silver rods which joined the pillars (NJPS, GW).

It is recommended that you follow the first interpretation.

**marble:** This is a kind of beautiful stone. It is hard and usually shiny. It can be different colors—white, black or white with stripes of other colors in it. It was used for pillars or for paving, as well as for statues.

#### 1:6c

**Gold and silver couches were arranged**

* There were long seats made of gold and silver so that people could lie on them while they ate

**couches:** This means a long low seat, often soft, where someone would normally recline (lie) to eat.

#### 1:6d

**on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother\-of\-pearl, and other costly stones.**

* These seats were on a floor that people had paved with beautiful stones of different colors.

**mosaic pavement:** The ground where the couches were was covered with beautiful stones of different colors arranged in patterns. There are four types of stone listed, but scholars are not sure what the Hebrew words mean, so nearly every version has a different translation. The important thing is that the area was paved with beautiful stones of different colors and this is how the verse has been translated in the Display. It is recommended that you do the same, rather than introducing names of stones which your readers do not know.

## Esther 1:7 (id: 513168)

### Section 1:1–9: King Xerxes gave a big feast

This section describes the setting for the story. It begins with a description of the Persian Empire and the feast which King Xerxes held in the third year of his reign to show his people how rich he was.

#### 1:7a

**Beverages were served in an array of goblets of gold, each with a different design,**

* During the feast beverages were served in cups made of gold. Each cup was made in a different design.

**Beverages were served:** The rest of the verse says that the beverages were wine. However, the text does not say who was serving the beverages. If your language has no passive, you may need to say something like: “The king’s servants served the beverages.…”

**goblets of gold:** This word refers to specially designed and decorated cups.

#### 1:7b

**and the royal wine flowed freely, according to the king’s bounty.**

* There was plenty of wine for the guests to drink because the king was generous.
* The king provided plenty of wine for his guests to drink because he was generous.

* **Associated Passages:** EST 1:7

## Esther 1:8 (id: 513170)

### Section 1:1–9: King Xerxes gave a big feast

This section describes the setting for the story. It begins with a description of the Persian Empire and the feast which King Xerxes held in the third year of his reign to show his people how rich he was.

#### 1:8a

**By order of the king, no limit was placed on the drinking,**

* Everyone was allowed to drink as much as he wanted,

**no limit was placed on the drinking:** This means that each man was free to drink as much or as little as he chose. There was so much wine available that a person could drink a lot if he wanted, but he was not compelled to do so.

#### 1:8b

**and every official of his household was to serve each man whatever he desired.**

* because the king had ordered his servants to keep on pouring out wine as long as the people still wanted to drink.

**every official of his household:** This refers to the servants whose job was to pour the wine for the guests.

**whatever he desired:** The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as *whatever he desired* means “as much as he wanted.”

* **Associated Passages:** EST 1:8

## Esther 1:9 (id: 513171)

### Section 1:1–9: King Xerxes gave a big feast

This section describes the setting for the story. It begins with a description of the Persian Empire and the feast which King Xerxes held in the third year of his reign to show his people how rich he was.

#### 1:9

**Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the royal palace of King Xerxes.**

* At the same time the wife of the king, whose name was Vashti, also gave a banquet in another part of the palace for the women.

**banquet:** This means a big feast where there was a lot to eat and drink. In Xerxes’ time, these banquets lasted many days or even weeks.

**for the women:** The text does not explain who these women were, but they may have been the wives of the officials who were feasting with the king.

* **Associated Passages:** EST 1:9

## Esther 1:10 (id: 513172)

### Section 1:10–22: Queen Vashti disobeyed the king and he removed her from her position as queen

Towards the end of the feast, when he had drunk too much wine, the king sent a message, ordering the queen to come to him so that he could show off her beauty to his guests. But she probably did not wish to be seen by a crowd of drunken, leering men, and so she refused. The king was very angry about the queen’s disobedience and asked his advisors what the law said about how she should be punished. The advisors said that the king should divorce the queen, in order to show all wives in the empire that they must obey their husbands. The king was pleased with this advice and issued a decree to inform everyone about it.

#### 1:10a

**On the seventh day, when the king’s heart was merry with wine,**

* ¶ On the seventh day of the feast, King Xerxes felt very happy because of all the wine he had drunk.

**the king’s heart was merry with wine:** Literally, “the heart of the king was good with wine.” By the last day of the feast, the king had drunk a lot of wine. If you have alcoholic drinks in your area, you probably have an expression to describe a person who has drunk enough wine to make him think he is very happy. You should use that expression here.

#### 1:10b

**he ordered the seven eunuchs who served him—Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carkas—**

* So he gave an order to the seven chief servants who looked after him. Their names were Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar and Carcas.

**eunuchs:** Many of the king’s servants were eunuchs, that is, men who had been castrated and therefore could no longer have sexual relations with a women. In ancient times a king would use such men to protect his wives because they would not try to have sexual relations with the women. If a literal translation would shock your readers or be too difficult to translate, then use a word for an important servant, and explain the meaning of “eunuch” in a footnote or in the glossary.

**who served him:** Literally “who served the face of the king.” This probably refers to the king’s personal servants, who were responsible for looking after him.

## Esther 1:11 (id: 513175)

### Section 1:10–22: Queen Vashti disobeyed the king and he removed her from her position as queen

Towards the end of the feast, when he had drunk too much wine, the king sent a message, ordering the queen to come to him so that he could show off her beauty to his guests. But she probably did not wish to be seen by a crowd of drunken, leering men, and so she refused. The king was very angry about the queen’s disobedience and asked his advisors what the law said about how she should be punished. The advisors said that the king should divorce the queen, in order to show all wives in the empire that they must obey their husbands. The king was pleased with this advice and issued a decree to inform everyone about it.

#### 1:11a

**to bring Queen Vashti before him, wearing her royal crown,**

* He told them to go to Queen Vashti and tell her to put on her crown, and then to bring her to him at the feast.

**her royal crown:** A crown is the special kind of hat a king or queen wears. In Europe, a crown is usually made of gold, but in Persia, it was probably a special sort of turban, that is, a long cloth wound round and round and fastened with some sort of jewel.

#### 1:11b

**to display her beauty to the people and officials. For she was beautiful to behold.**

* He wanted to show his officials and the other people at the feast, how very beautiful she was.
* He wanted the officials and the other people to see that she was very beautiful.

**officials:** See note on 1:3a.

* **Associated Passages:** EST 1:11

## Esther 1:12 (id: 513177)

#### 1:12a

**Queen Vashti, however, refused to come at the king’s command brought by his eunuchs.**

* But when the servants gave the king’s message/order to Queen Vashti, she refused to obey.

#### 1:12b

**And the king became furious, and his anger burned within him.**

* When he heard this, the king became very angry.

**became furious, and his anger burned within him:** The Hebrew uses two expressions to show how very angry the king was. You need to decide whether you should use two expressions in your language or just one very strong expression to show the same thing.

* **Associated Passages:** EST 1:12

## Esther 1:13 (id: 513179)

### Section 1:10–22: Queen Vashti disobeyed the king and he removed her from her position as queen

Towards the end of the feast, when he had drunk too much wine, the king sent a message, ordering the queen to come to him so that he could show off her beauty to his guests. But she probably did not wish to be seen by a crowd of drunken, leering men, and so she refused.

The advisors said that the king should divorce the queen, in order to show all wives in the empire that they must obey their husbands. The king was pleased with this advice and issued a decree to inform everyone about it.

#### 1:13a

**Then the king consulted the wise men who knew the times,**

* He summoned his advisors who knew what should be done about such matters as the queen’s disobedience and consulted them,

**the wise men who knew the times:** There is a textual problem with this verse, in particular with the word translated *times* by the BSB. The two possibilities are:

1. The text has the Hebrew word *ʿitîm* “times.” This is the text followed by the majority of the translations. This means the phrase could refer to astrologers, but here it probably refers to men who were experts in legal matters. For example, the GNT has:

    > his advisers, who would know what should be done

2. The text has *ḏaṯîm*, the plural of the word the BSB translates “law” in 1:13b. For example, the NRSV and NJB have:

    > who knew the laws

It is recommended that you follow the first option like the GNT.

#### 1:13b

**for it was customary for him to confer with the experts in law and justice.**

* because it was normal for the king to ask advice from wise men who knew all about the law and how to judge things.

**law and justice:** The Hebrew words *daṯ* and *dîn*, translated *law* and *justice* in the BSB, go together. The second one probably refers to legal procedures.

#### 1:14a

**His closest advisors were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan,**

* The names of the men he trusted the most were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena and Memucan.

#### 1:14b

**the seven princes of Persia and Media who had personal access to the king and ranked highest in the kingdom.**

* These seven men were the most important officials in the kingdom of Persia and Media and they were permitted to talk openly/freely to the king.

**princes:** See note on 1:3b.

**who had personal access to the king:** Literally “who saw the king’s face.” This means that they were allowed to enter the king’s presence freely and talk with him because he trusted them.

#### 1:15a

**“According to law,” he asked, “what should be done with Queen Vashti,**

* The king said to these men, “What does the law say should happen to Queen Vashti?

**he asked:** The BSB has added this to make it clear that the king has begun to speak. You will probably need to do something similar.

#### 1:15b

**since she refused to obey the command of King Xerxes delivered by the eunuchs?”**

* Because I, the king, sent an order to her by my servants and she refused to obey it.”

**the command of King Xerxes:** Consider whether in your language the king should refer to himself as *King Xerxes*, or whether this should be translated as “my command.”

**And in the presence of the king and his princes, Memucan replied,**

* ¶ Then Memucan said to the king in front of the other important men,

**princes:** See note on 1:3b.

#### 1:16b

**“Queen Vashti has wronged not only the king, but all the princes and the peoples in all the provinces of King Xerxes.**

* “Vashti, the queen, has done wrong. She has insulted not only you, the king, but she has also insulted all your officials and the people in every part of your kingdom.

**wronged not only the king:** Memucan did not refer to the king as “you” although he was speaking directly to him. You need to decide whether you can do this or whether you need to say “you.” If you have a special way of addressing a chief, you need to consider if you should use it here. For example, the CEV has:

> Your Majesty, Queen Vashti has not only embarrassed you

* Instead, they will say that when the king ordered his servants to bring Queen Vashti to him, she refused to come, so why should they obey their husbands.
* For they will say, ‘Queen Vashti refused to come to King Xerxes when he sent for her, so we do not need to do what our husbands tell us’

The advisors said that the king should divorce the queen, in order to show all wives in the empire that they must obey their husbands. The king was pleased with this advice and issued a decree to inform everyone about it.

#### 1:19a

**So if it pleases the king, let him issue a royal decree,**

* So, your Majesty, if you think it a good idea, give an order

#### 1:19b

**and let it be recorded in the laws of Persia and Media so that it cannot be repealed,**

* which your officials should add to the other laws of the kingdom of Persia and Media, laws which no one can ever revoke.
* and cause it to be written down with all the other laws of Persia and Media, laws which no one can cancel.

#### 1:19a\-b

**So if it pleases the king:** This phrase is used often in Esther when someone suggests something to the king. It is a polite way to say “if you agree.”

**a royal decree:** This means a command or order issued by the king.

#### 1:19c

**that Vashti shall never again enter the presence of King Xerxes,**

* The order should say that Vashti should never be allowed to come into your presence again.

**Vashti shall never again enter the presence of King Xerxes:** This implied that the king should never again permit Vashti to approach him either as queen or as wife.

#### 1:19d

**and that her royal position shall be given to a woman better than she.**

* Then you should choose another woman, someone better than she, and make her the queen instead.

**her royal position:** That is, her position as queen.

### Section 1:10–22: Queen Vashti disobeyed the king and he removed her from her position as queen

Towards the end of the feast, when he had drunk too much wine, the king sent a message, ordering the queen to come to him so that he could show off her beauty to his guests. But she probably did not wish to be seen by a crowd of drunken, leering men, and so she refused. The king was very angry about the queen’s disobedience and asked his advisors what the law said about how she should be punished. The advisors said that the king should divorce the queen, in order to show all wives in the empire that they must obey their husbands. The king was pleased with this advice and issued a decree to inform everyone about it.

* Then when news of your order spreads to all the towns of your large kingdom,
* Then when everyone in your huge kingdom hears what you have ordered to happen to Queen Vashti,

**The edict the king issues:** This has a similar meaning to “decree” in 1:19a.

#### 1:20b

**and so all women, from the least to the greatest, will honor their husbands.”**

* every woman in the kingdom, whether rich or poor, will respect her husband.”

**to each province in its own script and to each people in their own language,**

* Each message was written in the language and way of writing of the people who would receive it.

**script:** This means the alphabet people used to write their language. For example, if you write Hebrew, you use a different script from English.

#### 1:22c

**proclaiming that every man should be master of his own household.**

* In each message, written in the language of the people to whom it was written, the king gave the order that each man should be in control of his own family.

**in their own language:** This phrase is at the end of the verse in Hebrew and is literally “and speaking according to the language of his people.” Commentators and translators have found it difficult to understand this phrase and have many different solutions. Some of the possibilities are:

1. It is referring again to the language in which the message was to be written and announced (BSB, NIV, NLT).
2. The LXX (Greek OT) omitted the phrase completely and some English versions do the same (NJB, NRSV, CEV, NCV).
3. The husband should speak with final authority (GNT).

You may want to follow the interpretation of the major national translation in your area. The Display follows the first interpretation.

* He thought about what she had done and also about the order that he had made about her.

#### 2:1

**commissioners:** This was another kind of official.

#### 2:3b

**to assemble all the beautiful young women into the harem at the citadel of Susa.**

* to go and find all these beautiful girls. Then they should bring them to the house of your concubines in your palace here in Susa.

**harem:** This was the area of the palace where the concubines of the king lived. A concubine is a woman who is a secondary wife, that is, who is not legally married to a man but who lives like his wife. Usually a man would have several concubines but fewer legal wives.

**citadel of Susa:** See note on 1:2\.

#### 2:3c

Some time later the king decided to choose a new queen to replace Vashti. Many beautiful girls were brought to the palace and Esther was among them. When her turn came to go to the king, he liked her better than any other girl, so he chose her to be his new queen.

#### 2:5

**Now there was at the citadel of Susa a Jewish man from the tribe of Benjamin named Mordecai son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish.**

* ¶ At that time there was a Jew named Mordecai living in the city of Susa. He was the son of Jair who was the son of Shimei who was the son of Kish who was from the tribe of Benjamin.

**Now:** This verse introduces Mordecai, one of the important characters in the story. If you have special ways of introducing characters in stories in your language, you should introduce Mordecai in that way here. The BSB has indicated this by using *Now*.

**citadel of Susa:** See note on 1:2\.

**from the tribe of Benjamin:** All Jews traced their ancestors back to one of Jacob’s 12 sons. Benjamin was Jacob’s youngest son.

**son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish:** Jair, Shimei and Kish were ancestors of Mordecai. Hebrew used the term “son of” in the more general sense of “descendant of,” so some commentators think Shimei and Kish were famous ancestors of Mordecai who had lived many years before him. For example, Shimei is mentioned in 2 Samuel 16:5; and the father of King Saul, the first king of Israel, was called Kish (see 1 Samuel 9:1–2\). GNT translates it in this way. However, this verse must be considered with the comments on 2:6 below, which seem to suggest that it is a literal “son of” which was meant here.

## Esther 2:6 (id: 513204)

### Section 2:1–18: The king chose a new queen

Some time later the king decided to choose a new queen to replace Vashti. Many beautiful girls were brought to the palace and Esther was among them. When her turn came to go to the king, he liked her better than any other girl, so he chose her to be his new queen.

#### 2:6

**He had been carried into exile from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon among those taken captive with Jeconiah king of Judah.**

* Many years before, when Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had conquered the country of Judah and taken captive its king, Jehoiachin, and many other people from there, this Kish was among the people who had been taken away from the city of Jerusalem into Babylon.

**He had been carried into exile:** It is not clear to whom exactly this refers and the BSB is ambiguous. There are three main possibilities:

1. It refers to Kish, the great\-grandfather of Mordecai. This seems to be the easiest way of understanding the Hebrew. *(NJPS, CEV, GW)*
2. It refers to Mordecai himself. However, if it were Mordecai himself who had been taken captive in 597 BC, he would be a very old man in 480 BC when this story takes place. So this seems rather unlikely. *(GNT, REB)*
3. It refers to Mordecai’s family, but not necessarily Mordecai himself. No major English version follows this interpretation.

Both (1\) and (2\) are possible grammatically, but (1\) is more probable since it is unlikely that Mordecai was already 120 years old in this story.

**carried into exile:** This means to be taken away or sent away from your own country and forced to live in another place.

**taken captive with Jeconiah king of Judah:** This refers to when the Babylonians defeated the people of the tribe of Judah in 597 BC. King Nebuchadnezzar then took the king of Judah and many of his people back with him to Babylon as captives. When the OT refers to “Judah” it usually includes the tribe of Benjamin as well.

#### 2:7a

**And Mordecai had brought up Hadassah (that is, Esther), the daughter of his uncle,**

* Mordecai had reared Hadassah (called Esther), his cousin,

**the daughter of his uncle:** Literally “daughter of his paternal uncle.” Esther’s father and Mordecai’s father were brothers. You should use the correct kinship term in your language for this sort of relative.

#### 2:7b

**because she did not have a father or mother.**

* because both her father and mother were dead.

##### **General Comment about 2:7**

You may want to rearrange this verse in your language because of the repetition. GNT would be a helpful model to follow, if you wish to combine 2:7b and 2:7e:

> He had a cousin, Esther, whose Hebrew name was Hadassah; she was a beautiful young woman, and had a good figure. At the death of her parents, Mordecai had adopted her and brought her up as his own daughter, (GNT)

#### 2:18b

**He proclaimed a tax holiday in the provinces**

* He also said that all the people in his kingdom could rest from their work to celebrate Esther becoming queen.

**tax holiday:** The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as *holiday* is more literally “causing to rest.” There are two main ways that English versions translate this word:

1. It refers to any type of holiday. *(NIV, GNT, NCV, CEV)*
2. It refers to a period of not paying taxes, something that kings of that time sometimes did to celebrate special events. *(BSB, NJPS, RSV)*

It is recommended that you follow the first option.

#### 2:18c

**and gave gifts worthy of the king’s bounty.**

* He also told his servants to distribute presents among the people to demonstrate his generosity.
* Also he gave many good things to people in the way that is fitting for a king.

**worthy of the king’s bounty:** This means that the king did it in a way which displayed his generosity. He did it in the way people expected a king to behave.

## Esther 2:19 (id: 513226)

### Section 2:19–23: Mordecai discovered a plot against the king

These verses describe an event which will be very important later in the story. Two of the king’s servants were angry with the king and plotted to kill him. Mordecai heard about the plot and told Esther, who in turn told the king. The two servants were executed, and the event was written in the records of the kingdom.

#### 2:19a

**When the virgins were assembled a second time,**

* ¶ After some time, the king’s officials gathered together the group of virgins again.

**When the virgins were assembled a second time:** It is not known who this group of virgins was or why they were gathered together after Esther had already been chosen to be queen. The various interpretations are:

1. It refers to the previous group of virgins first mentioned in 2:8\. *(BSB, KJV, NIV, RSV, NJPS, NASB, GW; Keil \& Delitzsch, p.341\).*
2. It refers to the gathering of another group of virgins. *(LB; Bush, p.372\)*
3. It should be omitted. *(LXX, REB, GNT, NCV)*

It is recommended that you follow the first interpretation, which is the majority view.

#### 2:19b

**Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate.**

* By this time, Mordecai had become one of the officials working for the king.

**Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate:** This can be understood in two different ways:

1. It is meant figuratively. The gate of the king’s palace was where important business took place, so to say that Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate means that he was an important government official. *(GNT, CEV)*
2. It should be understood literally. Once Esther became queen, Mordecai would spend time at the palace entrance, hoping to get news of how Esther was. *(BSB, NIV, RSV, NCV, NJPS, GW)*

It is recommended that you follow the first interpretation because it is the most logical one in the context.

Mordecai heard about the plot and told Esther, who in turn told the king. The two servants were executed, and the event was written in the records of the kingdom.

#### 2:23a

**After the report had been investigated and verified,**

* The king sent people to investigate the story and they found out that it was true.

#### 2:23b

**both officials were hanged on the gallows.**

* So, on the king’s orders, they seized the two servants and they hung them on wooden poles, and so they died.

**hanged on the gallows:** In the Hebrew, this phrase is more literally “hanged on a tree.” It is possible that Xerxes had these men executed by impaling them on a piece of wood, rather than hanging them by a rope. However, the Hebrew text uses the verb “to hang,” and this is how most English versions translate it. It is recommended that you follow the majority of English translations.

#### 2:23c

**And all this was recorded in the Book of the Chronicles in the presence of the king.**

* Then, the king ordered that one of his secretaries should write, as he watched, all that had happened in the book where they recorded the important things that happened in the kingdom.

### Section 3:1–6: Haman became angry with Mordecai

The next event in the story was that the king promoted one of his officials called Haman to the highest position in the land, next to the king himself. The king ordered all his servants to bow down to Haman in respect to him, but Mordecai refused to do this because he was a Jew. When Haman heard about this, he was angry and planned to destroy all the Jews in the empire. He cast lots to find out the best day to choose for killing the Jews.

#### 3:1a

**After these events, King Xerxes honored Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite,**

* ¶ Some years later, King Xerxes greatly honored a man called Haman, son of Hammedatha, a descendant of Agag.

**After these events:** The text doesn’t state an exact time here, but it was probably about four years after Esther had become queen.

**honored:** No reason is given why the king suddenly decided to honor Haman.

**Agagite:** Agag was the name of the king of the Amalekites whom King Saul conquered and took prisoner and whom Samuel cut in pieces (1 Samuel 15:8, 33\). It may be that Haman was descended from this king.

#### 3:1b

**elevating him to a position above all the princes who were with him.**

* He gave him a more important job than before and made him chief over all the other officials in his kingdom.
* He promoted him and made him more important than all the other officials.

When Haman heard about this, he was angry and planned to destroy all the Jews in the empire. He cast lots to find out the best day to choose for killing the Jews.

#### 3:2a

**All the royal servants at the king’s gate bowed down and paid homage to Haman,**

* All the officials who worked at the palace gate knelt down and bowed their heads to the ground in front of Haman to show their respect

**royal servants:** See note on “official” at 1:3a.

**at the king’s gate:** See note on 2:19b.

**bowed down:** Literally “prostrate oneself,” that is, a person knelt on the ground and bent forward until his head touched the ground. It was a common way of showing respect to someone very important. If such actions in your culture do not mean showing respect, you will have to add this implicit information or state the information in a footnote.

#### 3:2b

**because the king had commanded that this be done for him.**

* just as the king had ordered them to do.

#### 3:2c

**But Mordecai would not bow down or pay homage.**

* But Mordecai refused to do this.

#### 3:2b\-c

The text does not explain why Mordecai refused to bow down. The only clue given is 3:4, where he seems to have told the other servants that it was because he was a Jew. Perhaps he refused to bow down because he thought this would be disobeying the second commandment (Exodus 20:4\).

### Section 3:7–15: Haman plotted to kill the Jews

Haman went to the king and told him that the Jews in the empire did not obey the laws of the land, and so they all should be killed. The king authorized him to write an order saying that the Jews should be killed. Haman caused the order to be sent out everywhere in the kingdom on the thirteenth day of the first month of the next year. The order told the public to be ready to attack the Jews on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month.

#### 3:7a

**In the twelfth year of King Xerxes, in the first month, the month of Nisan,**

* ¶ It was now the twelfth year that Xerxes was king. During the first month of that year, the month called Nisan,

**Nisan:** See the note about Tebeth in 2:16\. The month of Nisan was mid\-March to mid\-April.

#### 3:7b

**the Pur (that is, the lot) was cast before Haman**

* Haman ordered the astrologers to cast lots while he was watching. This lot was also called “pur.”

#### 3:7c

**to determine a day and month.**

* They did this because Haman wanted to know the best day and the best month to do what he had planned.

#### 3:7b\-c

**the Pur (that is, the lot) was cast before Haman:** The verse does not say who cast the Pur. The Hebrew text says “he cast…” but this cannot refer to Haman, because the verse contains the phrase “in the presence of Haman.” Because of this, many versions make this phrase passive and say, “the Pur was cast.” The Pur, or the lot, were probably cast by an astrologer or another person who claimed to be able to predict the future. If your language has no passive, you could say: “Haman ordered the people to cast the Pur (that is, the lot).”

**Pur:** This was another word for “lot.” This word is important because the Jews used the plural of this word, purim, as the name of the festival they would later hold to celebrate their victory over their enemies (see 9:20–32\).

**lot:** No one knows exactly how Persians cast lots. One possible method could have been that someone threw a group of small objects like stones or sticks in the air. After they fell to the ground, this person would study the pattern they made and from it answer the question being asked.

#### 3:7d

**And the lot fell on the twelfth month, the month of Adar.**

* After they had cast the lots, they decided that the best time would be the twelfth month which is called Adar.

**Adar:** See the note about Tebeth in 2:16\. The month of Adar was mid\-February to mid\-March.

## Esther 3:8 (id: 513246)

### Section 3:7–15: Haman plotted to kill the Jews

Haman went to the king and told him that the Jews in the empire did not obey the laws of the land, and so they all should be killed. The king authorized him to write an order saying that the Jews should be killed. Haman caused the order to be sent out everywhere in the kingdom on the thirteenth day of the first month of the next year. The order told the public to be ready to attack the Jews on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month.

#### 3:8a

**Then Haman informed King Xerxes,**

* Then Haman went to the king, and said to him,

#### 3:8b

**“There is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the peoples of every province of your kingdom. Their laws are different from everyone else’s,**

* “Your Majesty, there is a certain race of people living everywhere throughout your kingdom. They live among the other races, but their customs are not like those of any other race in your kingdom.

#### 3:8a\-b

Haman was addressing the king. Some Bible versions use an honorific title to show that Haman was addressing the king. You again need to decide whether or not to use a term like “Your Majesty” and whether Haman should address the king as “you” or not.

#### 3:8c

**and they do not obey the king’s laws.**

* They continually disobey your laws.

#### 3:8d

**So it is not in the king’s best interest to tolerate them.**

* It is of no advantage to you to allow them to continue to live in your kingdom.
* Things would be better for you if you did not allow them to live in your kingdom any longer.

#### 3:8c\-d

**So it is not in the king’s best interest to tolerate them:** This can also be translated in a negative form. For example, the CEV has:

> We would be better off to get rid of them!

* So, if it pleases you, tell your officials to send out an order to kill them.
* So, if this seems like a good idea to you, make a command which says that people have your permission to kill them.

**and I will deposit ten thousand talents of silver into the royal treasury to pay those who carry it out.”**

* If you do this, I will bring 750,000 pounds of silver and give it to the officials who look after your wealth and they can store it with the rest of your riches.”

**ten thousand talents of silver:** This was an enormous amount of money. A talent weighed 75 pounds (34 kilograms). So the total amount was 750,000 pounds of silver (340,000 kilograms). This equals 335 British tons, 375 American tons and 340 metric tonnes. You should choose whichever measure is normally used in your area. However the most important thing to communicate is that Haman was promising a huge amount of money. If you use footnotes in your translation, you could put this information there. The text does not explain where Haman expected to get all this money. He may have been very wealthy already, or he may have expected to get the wealth of the Jews who would be killed.

**the royal treasury:** This refers to the place where all the king’s wealth was stored.

**those who carry it out:** Literally “the doers of the work.” This may refer to:

1. the officials who ran the government of the empire, as the same expression clearly does in 9:3\. Here it would refer especially to those who looked after the king’s financial matters. The order of the Hebrew and the reference to the “royal treasury” also suggest that this is the best interpretation. *(RSV, GNT, NCV, CEV, NJPS, GW, REB, NLT, JB)*
2. the men who would carry out the order to destroy all the Jews. *(BSB, NIV)*

It is recommended that you follow option 1\. The Display follows the NCV.

* When the king heard this plan, he removed his ring from his finger

**the signet ring:** This was a ring that the king wore on his finger which he used to press on the wax which sealed his letters. This would show that the document had been written with the king’s authority and so its message should be obeyed.

**but:** The action of the king and Haman, sitting calmly drinking, contrasts very strongly with the confusion among the people of the city.

**the city of Susa:** This refers to the people living in the city.

**in confusion:** The text does not explain why the people were *in confusion*. Most likely it was because they did not understand the reason for the edict and so were upset and confused.

* ¶ When Mordecai heard about all that had happened,

#### 4:1b

**he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes,**

* he was very sad. So he tore his clothes and instead dressed himself in rough cloth and sprinkled ashes on his head.

**tore his clothes:** This was one way Jews showed that something terrible had happened to them.

**put on sackcloth:** Sackcloth was coarse cloth usually made from goat’s hair and black in color. The Jews dressed in sackcloth to mourn for the dead or at times of great personal or national disaster.

**put on…ashes:** This was yet another way to show deep grief. A person would usually sprinkle the ashes on his head.

You may need to find some way of informing your readers that all these actions were a sign of being very unhappy about something. The Display shows one way. Another way would be to explain the actions in a footnote.

#### 4:1c

**and went out into the middle of the city, wailing loudly and bitterly.**

* Dressed like this, he walked through the city, crying and wailing loudly.

**wailing loudly and bitterly:** Use the natural expression in your language for expressing great sorrow.

### Section 4:1–17: Mordecai asked Esther to beg the king to save the Jews

When Mordecai heard about the order to kill the Jews, he dressed in the sort of clothes he would wear to mourn someone who had died and walked around the city weeping loudly. Esther sent him other clothes but he refused to wear them. She then sent a messenger to find out why he was behaving in this way. Mordecai gave the messenger a copy of the decree to show to Esther, and he pleaded with her to go and ask the king not to destroy the Jews. Esther hesitated, but finally agreed, although it was dangerous for her to approach the king in this way and she might be killed.

**In every province to which the king’s command and edict came,**

* In every province, wherever the messengers with the king’s order arrived,
* Everywhere in the kingdom, where people learned about the law which the king had made,

**king’s command and edict:** See note on 2:8a.

#### 4:3b

**there was great mourning among the Jews. They fasted, wept, and lamented,**

* the Jews were very distressed. They refused to eat food, they wept and they lamented.

**They fasted:** When people fasted, they chose not to eat food for a chosen length of time. They also usually prayed to God. In the book of Esther there is a sharp contrast between the king and his men who feasted (see 3:15\), and the Jews who fasted (see 4:3, 16\).

#### 4:3c

**and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.**

* Because of their grief many people spread ashes and rough cloth on the ground and lay on top of them.

**many lay in sackcloth and ashes:** Literally “sackcloth and ashes were spread to many.” This phrase is ambiguous in many English versions. There are three possibilities:

1. *lay in sackcloth and ashes* means that people spread ashes on the ground, put sackcloth on top of the ashes, and then they lay on the sackcloth. For example, the NCV has:

    > many of them lay down on rough cloth and ashes *(BSB, NCV, REB)*

2. The expression means to “put on,” in the same way as Mordecai did in 4:1b. So the people acted in the same way as Mordecai. For example, the GW has:

    > Many put on sackcloth and ashes *(GW)*

3. *lay in sackcloth* means to lie down wearing sackcloth. However *lay in…ashes* means to lie down on ashes. For example, the GNT has:

    > most of them put on sackcloth and lay in ashes *(GNT, CEV)*

It is recommended that you follow the first option.

**for her people:** Mordecai was reminding Esther that she too was a Jew. If there is no distinction between “his” and “her” in your language, you must take care that it is referring clearly to Esther’s people, not the king’s or Hathach’s.

**“All the royal officials and the people of the king’s provinces know that one law applies to every man or woman who approaches the king in the inner court without being summoned—that he be put to death.**

* “Everyone, whether one of the king’s officials or an ordinary person in any part of the kingdom knows the law. It says that if anyone, whether man or woman, goes into the room in the middle of the palace where the king usually is without a special invitation from him, the king will tell his servants to kill that person.

**All the royal officials and the people of the king’s provinces:** That is, everyone throughout the kingdom.

**royal officials:** See note on 1:3a.

**the inner court:** This was the part of the palace where the king met with people.

**without being summoned:** That is, without the king inviting them to come.

#### 4:11b

**Only if the king extends the gold scepter may that person live.**

* The only escape is if the king holds out his gold stick to the person to show that he should not die.
* The only way that this will not happen is if the king holds out his gold stick to the person. Then he will not die.

**the gold scepter:** This was the special stick that the king often held in his hand. It indicated the king’s authority to rule. It was made of gold.

**For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place,**

* If you refuse to beg the king to save the Jews now, someone else will rescue the Jews.

**from another place:** There are two different possibilites to interpret where the other *place* where help will come from:

1. The help will come from someone else. For example, the NCV has:

    > someone else will come to help and save the Jewish people *(BSB, NCV, NIV, NLT, ESV)*

2. The help will come from God. For example, the GNT has:

    > help will come from heaven

It is recommended that you follow the first option, there is nothing in the text to suggest Mordecai was referring to God.

#### 4:14b

**but you and your father’s house will perish.**

* But you and your family will die.
* But our whole family, including you, will die.

**you and your father’s house:** The CEV includes Mordecai with those who would be saved in 4:14a (“we will somehow get help”). But Mordecai was part of Esther’s father’s family, so he was surely including himself in those who would die if Esther didn’t speak to the king.

#### 4:14c

**And who knows if perhaps you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this?”**

* Perhaps the reason you became queen was to prevent such a bad thing as this from happening.”

**you have come to the kingdom:** That is, “you have become queen.”

**“Go and assemble all the Jews who can be found in Susa, and fast for me.**

* “Assemble all the Jews who live in Susa. Then you(plur) all must decide not to eat, but instead pray for me.

**Go:** The Hebrew word *leḵ* literally means “go.” However, when this word precedes another command, it usually makes the second command more emphatic and so should not be translated literally. In English, “go” can be used in the same way as it is in Hebrew, but if in your language it would mean that Esther was telling Mordecai to go somewhere, you should choose one of the following options:

* If there is some other way of emphasizing a command in your language, use that to emphasize the commands “*assemble” and “fast,”* and omit “go.”
* Just omit “go,” as the CEV has done.

**fast for me:** See note on 4:3b. Here, because the text says *fast for me*, it is very probable that Esther wanted the people, while they fasted, to pray to God to help her.

#### 4:16b

**Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day,**

* For three days and three nights do not eat or drink anything.

After Esther had finished fasting, she went to the inner rooms of the palace. The king was pleased to see her and promised to grant any request she might make. So she asked that the king and Haman should come and eat a special meal that she would get her servants to prepare for them. The king agreed.

#### 5:1a

**On the third day, Esther put on her royal attire**

* ¶ After Esther had refused food for two days, the next day she put on clothes which showed that she was queen.

**On the third day:** That is, on the last day of the fast.

#### 5:1b

**and stood in the inner court of the palace across from the king’s quarters.**

* Then she went into the middle part of the palace. This area was near the room where the king’s special chair was.

**the king’s quarters:** The word translated “quarters” is literally “house.” The expression “house of the king” can mean the whole palace, but here it probably refers to the room where the king would sit on his throne to receive visitors.

#### 5:1c

**The king was sitting on his royal throne in the royal courtroom, facing the entrance.**

* At the moment when she entered the area, the king was sitting on his special chair, looking toward the entrance to the room.

**his royal throne:** A throne is the special chair a king or queen sits on, especially when greeting visitors or during other special occasions. It may have been made of, or decorated with, gold.

**As soon as the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, she found favor in his sight.**

* When he saw the queen, Esther, standing outside the room, he was pleased to see her.

#### 5:2b

**The king extended the gold scepter in his hand toward Esther,**

* So he stretched out the gold stick he was holding to her to show her that he allowed her to approach him.

**the gold scepter:** See note on 4:11b.

#### 5:2c

**and she approached and touched the tip of the scepter.**

* So Esther entered the room, went toward the king and touched the end of the stick.

**touched the tip of the scepter:** The text does not describe whether Esther touched the scepter with her hand or her lips (that is, she kissed it; see Keil\-Delitzsch, p. 355\). If you can use a general verb, like the English versions, and not specify how she touched the scepter, you should do so. If it is necessary in your language to say how she touched the scepter, it is recommended that you say “with her hand,” since this is the most natural meaning of the Hebrew verb.

#### 5:3a

**“What is it, Queen Esther?” the king inquired. “What is your request?**

* Then the king asked her, “Queen Esther, what’s the matter? What do you want to ask me?

**Queen Esther:** You need to decide the best way for King Xerxes to address Esther in your language. In Hebrew, he uses her title “queen” and her name “Esther.” Maybe it would be better for you just to use her name, or just her title or even to not use either one.

**“may the king and Haman come today to the banquet I have prepared for the king.”**

* please come to me today. I have caused a feast to be prepared for you. Bring Haman with you.”

**the banquet I have prepared for the king:** Because Esther is referring to the king in the third person, “him” refers to the king, not Haman.

* So the king turned to one of his servants and said, “Go and bring Haman here at once so that we(dual excl) can go together to the queen’s feast.”

Notice that the king was no longer talking to Esther, but to one of his servants. The Display shows a couple of ways to state this explicitly.

**Esther:** The king here refers to Esther by her name. If this would be inappropriate or too familiar in your language, you may have to say “the queen” instead.

## Esther 5:12 (id: 513298)

### Section 5:9–14: Haman planned to kill Mordecai

Haman was delighted that Esther had invited him to eat with the king again, since it was a great honor. But on his way home, he became angry when Mordecai once more refused to show him the respect he thought he was owed, and, taking his friends’ advice, he decided to kill him.

#### 5:12a

**“What is more,” Haman added, “Queen Esther invited no one but me to join the king at the banquet she prepared,**

* Then he continued, “There is something better than all that. Today when Esther, the queen, invited the king to eat a feast, I was the only other person she invited.

Notice that in the English versions, this verse is in direct speech, whereas 5:11 was indirect. You need to decide if it is possible in your language to keep these verses in this way or whether it would be better to treat both verses in the same way.

**What is more:** This translates a Hebrew word which means that what follows is even greater than what was before. Here is another way to translate this phrase:

> And that’s not all (NIV)

**banquet:** See note on 1:9\.

#### 5:12b

**and I am invited back tomorrow along with the king.**

* And she has invited me as well as the king to another feast tomorrow.

**I am invited back tomorrow along with the king:** The emphasis is on the word “me” here. Haman was saying that he was such an important man in the kingdom that he was the only other person besides the king who was invited to the queen’s feast.

* But all these things are not enough to keep me happy while I can still see day after day that Jew Mordecai sitting at the palace entrance.”

**a gallows…Mordecai hanged on it:** See note on 2:23b. The pole, or some kind of structure made of wood, was to be very tall (75 feet or 25 meters) so that everybody would see Mordecai’s dead body.

#### 5:14c

### Section 6:1–14: The king honored Mordecai

The same night that Haman was planning Mordecai’s death, the king could not sleep. So he told his servants to read to him from the book of the annals, in which the important events of his reign were recorded. One of the events the servants read about was the time when Mordecai had saved his life (see 2:19–23\), and the king decided that he ought to reward him. So when Haman arrived the next morning, the king asked him how he thought the king ought to reward a man whom he wanted to honor. Haman suggested some ways to do that, thinking that the king was referring to him. The king then decided to honor Mordecai in those ways, and made Haman carry out his suggestions.

#### 6:1

**That night sleep escaped the king; so he ordered the Book of Records, the Chronicles, to be brought in and read to him.**

* ¶ That same night, the king could not sleep, so he told his servants to bring the book in which people had written down all the important things that had happened in his kingdom since he had become king and read it to him.

**That night:** That is, the same night that Haman was planning to kill Mordecai.

**the Book of Records, the Chronicles:** This was the record of the important events which had happened since Xerxes became king. It refers to the same book as “the Book of the Chronicles” in 2:23c.

**The king inquired, “What honor or dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this act?”**

* This reminded the king of what had happened and he asked, “What reward did I give Mordecai for what he did? How did I honor him?”

**honor or dignity:** These two words are similar in meaning. If you do not have two suitable terms, you may follow the CEV and combine the two:

> What has been done to reward Mordecai for this?

#### 6:3b

**Now:** This word here does not mean “at the present time.” The BSB has added this word to show that this piece of information is a sort of parenthesis. It is something which has already happened or has just happened. If you have a special word in your language which shows that a sentence is background information, you should use it here.

**the king is delighted to honor:** The king is again referring to himself as “the king” not “I.” Translate this in the same way as you have done before. See note on 1:15b.

#### 6:6b

**Now Haman thought to himself, “Whom would the king be delighted to honor more than me?”**

* Haman thought about it, saying to himself, “The king must be talking about me. There is no one else that he would want to honor.”

**Haman thought to himself:** What follows this is what Haman was thinking, so he did not speak it aloud. You need to decide whether in your language you can use direct speech for people’s thoughts.

**Whom would the king be delighted to honor more than me?:** Since this is a rhetorical question, not a real question, it could be translated as a statement. For example: “There is nobody whom the king would want to honor more than me.” Decide whether the question or statement is more natural and more vivid in your language.

#### 6:8b

**and a horse on which the king himself has ridden—one with a royal crest placed on its head.**

* Then tell them to bring one of your horses, one that you yourself have ridden. Let them put one of your crowns on its head.

**a royal crest placed on its head:** This is the same word in Hebrew as was used for the queen’s crown in 1:11a and 2:17c. See note on 1:11a. Here the crown was attached to the horse’s head to show that the horse belonged to the king.

* Then tell your servants to give the robe and the horse to one of your highest officials

#### 6:9b

**Let them array the man the king wants to honor**

* and let him dress the man that you want to honor in the robe,

**Let them array:** There is a textual issue here:

1. The LXX has a singular subject “him.” For example, the NRSV has:

    > Let him robe *(GNT, CEV, NLT, NRSV, REB, NJB)*

2. The Hebrew text has the plural subject. For example, the ESV has:

    > Let them dress *(BSB, ESV, NASB, NIV)*

It is recommended that you follow the first option, as this makes the most sense in context. See the Display.

#### 6:9c

* and put him on the horse and lead him through the city.

#### 6:9d

**proclaiming before him, ‘This is what is done for the man whom the king is delighted to honor!’”**

* As the official leads him through the streets, he should call out loudly, ‘Look how well the king treats the man he wants to honor.’ ”

#### 6:9c–d

#### 7:4a

**For my people and I have been sold out to destruction, death, and annihilation.**

* For someone has betrayed me and the people of my race, so that every one of us will be killed and completely destroyed.

**have been sold out:** This could refer to the money Haman offered to the king (see note on 3:9b) or as a way of saying “betrayed” or “handed over to.” It is probably the latter.

**destruction, death, and annihilation:** These are translated from the same three Hebrew verbs as in 3:13b. See the note on that verse. Even if you do not use three words in your translation, be sure to use language that is very strong and includes the idea of no Jew being left alive.

#### 7:4b

**If we had merely been sold as menservants and maidservants, I would have remained silent,**

* If this person had only sold us, both men and women, as slaves, I would not have said anything to you,

#### 7:4c

**because no such distress would justify burdening the king.”**

* because that would not have been important enough to justify troubling you.”

**no such distress would justify burdening the king:** The meaning of this clause in Hebrew is not clear because several of the words have more than one meaning. The two most likely meanings are:

1. If Haman had intended only to sell the Jews as slaves, that would not have been sufficient reason to trouble the king with the problem. *(BSB, NIV, GNT, NCV, CEV, GW)*
2. The word translated *distress* in the BSB can also mean “enemy” and the verb translated *burdening* can also mean “compensate.” So the expression means that no enemy would be able to compensate for the loss to the king caused by the death of so many of the people in the empire. *(NRSV, NJB)*

It is recommended that you follow the first interpretation.

When the king and Haman came to Esther’s second feast, Esther begged the king not to allow her and the other Jews to be killed. When the king heard that it was Haman who had ordered their destruction, he was very angry and left the room. When he returned, he found Haman pleading with Esther, but since he was lying on the couch on which Esther also was lying, he suspected him of trying to rape Esther and ordered his death. So Haman was hung on the tall pole which he had had erected for putting Mordecai to death.

#### 7:8a

**Just as the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was reclining.**

* ¶ Now Esther was lying on a couch. Haman threw himself down next to her to beg her for mercy. At that very moment, the king came back from the garden into the room where they had been eating.

**couch:** See note on 1:6c.

#### 7:8b

**The king exclaimed, “Would he actually assault the queen while I am in the palace?”**

* When the king saw Haman on the couch beside Esther he shouted: “Is this man going to rape the queen even while I am present in the palace with her?”
* When the king saw this, he said loudly: “This man thinks he can rape the queen even while I am here with her in the palace!”

**Would he actually assault the queen while I am in the palace?:** This is a rhetorical question. The Display shows one way of expressing this as a statement.

#### 7:8c

**As soon as the words had left the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face.**

* As soon as the king said this, the servants took a cloth and covered Haman’s face. This showed that Haman would die.

**they covered Haman’s face:** Most scholars think that this action showed that Haman was condemned to death. You will need to find some way of making this clear to your readers. The Display shows one way of doing this. However, if you are using footnotes in your translation, it would be better to put this information in a footnote.

### Section 8:1–17: Xerxes allowed the Jews to protect themselves

After Haman’s death, the king gave Esther everything that had belonged to Haman and made Mordecai the chief official in the land. Esther asked the king to cancel Haman’s order to kill the Jews.

* Then he took his ring off his finger and gave it to Mordecai. This was the same ring that he had previously given to Haman and taken back when he died.

After Haman’s death, the king gave Esther everything that had belonged to Haman and made Mordecai the chief official in the land. Esther asked the king to cancel Haman’s order to kill the Jews.

#### 8:5a

**“If it pleases the king,” she said, “and if I have found favor in his sight, and the matter seems proper to the king, and I am pleasing in his sight,**

* She said, “Your Majesty, if you are willing, and if you are pleased with me, and if you think that it is right to do,

This part of the verse contains four main clauses:

1. **If it pleases the king**
2. **and if I have found favor in his sight**
3. **and the matter seems proper to the king**
4. **and I am pleasing in his sight**

Clause 1, *If it pleases the king,* is similar in meaning to clause 3, *and the matter seems proper to the king,* and clause 2, *and if I have found favor in his sight,* is similar in meaning to clause 4, *and I am pleasing in his sight.*

You need to decide in your translation whether you should translate each clause separately or whether you should combine clauses. Any of these ways is acceptable, so you can choose the one that can be most easily translated into your language. GNT has translated clauses 1 and 3 separately but combined 2 and 4\. You could also combine 1 and 3, then combine 2 and 4, as in the CEV:

> I know you will do the right thing, and that you really love me

#### 8:5b

**may an order be written to revoke the letters that the scheming Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, wrote**

* tell your secretaries to write a document to cancel the orders in the documents which Haman, son of Hammedatha, the descendant of Agag, planned and wrote.

**letters:** See note on 1:22a.

**Agagite:** See note on 3:1a.

**to destroy the Jews in all the king’s provinces.**

* In those documents Haman ordered the people to kill all the Jews everywhere in your kingdom.

After Haman’s death, the king gave Esther everything that had belonged to Haman and made Mordecai the chief official in the land. Esther asked the king to cancel Haman’s order to kill the Jews. The king instead permitted her and Mordecai to send letters in his name allowing the Jews to defend themselves and kill their enemies. The news of this order brought great joy to the Jews.

#### 8:6a

**For how could I bear to see the disaster that would befall my people?**

* Please do this for I cannot bear to see the people of my race suffer in that way.
* For I cannot bear to see such a terrible thing happen to the people of my race.

**For:** This gives the reason why Esther was making her request to the king in these verses.

**how could I bear to see the disaster that would befall my people?:** This is a rhetorical question. Decide whether in your language it is better to use the question or statement form. The question in 8:6b is also rhetorical.

#### 8:6b

**How could I bear to see the destruction of my kindred?”**

* I cannot bear to see people destroy my family like that.”

After Haman’s death, the king gave Esther everything that had belonged to Haman and made Mordecai the chief official in the land. Esther asked the king to cancel Haman’s order to kill the Jews. The king instead permitted her and Mordecai to send letters in his name allowing the Jews to defend themselves and kill their enemies. The news of this order brought great joy to the Jews.

#### 8:7a

**So King Xerxes said to Esther the Queen and Mordecai the Jew,**

* ¶ Then King Xerxes said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai, the Jew,

#### 8:7b

**“Behold, I have given Haman’s estate to Esther,**

* “I gave everything that belonged to Haman to you, Esther,

**Haman’s estate:** See note on 8:1a.

#### 8:7c

**and he was hanged on the gallows**

* and I ordered my servants to hang him on the pole so that he died.

**hanged on the gallows:** See note on 2:23b.

#### 8:7d

**because he attacked the Jews.**

* I did that because Haman planned to kill the Jews.

**because he attacked the Jews:** The Hebrew text is more literally “laid hands on the Jews.” Because Haman’s attack on the Jews was still in the future, you may translate this phrase in a different way:

> Because Haman was against the Jews (NCV)

> Because of his evil plans to kill the Jews (CEV)

##### **General Comment about 8:7b–d**

It may be more logical in your language to reverse 8:7b and 8:7c–d. Haman was killed at the end of chapter 7, and then the king gave his property to Esther, so you may want to keep that same order here. GNT does this: “I have hanged Haman for his plot against the Jews, and I have given Esther his property.”

## Esther 8:8 (id: 513354)

### Section 8:1–17: Xerxes allowed the Jews to protect themselves

After Haman’s death, the king gave Esther everything that had belonged to Haman and made Mordecai the chief official in the land. Esther asked the king to cancel Haman’s order to kill the Jews. The king instead permitted her and Mordecai to send letters in his name allowing the Jews to defend themselves and kill their enemies. The news of this order brought great joy to the Jews.

#### 8:8a

**Now you may write in the king’s name as you please regarding the Jews,**

* Now I give you permission to write another order, one with my authority, to prevent people from killing the Jews. Write it however you think is best.

**write in the king’s name:** See note on 3:12d.

#### 8:8b

**and seal it with the royal signet ring.**

* When you have written it, seal it with wax and stamp it with my own ring.

**seal it with the royal signet ring:** See note on 3:12e.

#### 8:8c

**For a decree that is written in the name of the king and sealed with the royal signet ring cannot be revoked.”**

* No document written with my authority and sealed with my own ring can be cancelled.”
* If someone writes a document with my authority and seals it with my ring, no one can cancel it.”

**For a decree that is written in the name of the king and sealed with the royal signet ring cannot be revoked:** The commentators and English versions do not agree on which document the king is referring to here. There are two possibilities:

1. It is a general statement, referring to any order made in the king’s name. In this verse it therefore refers to the order Esther and Mordecai were about to make. Because the king authorized it to be issued, no one would be able to cancel it. This is the best interpretation of this sentence based on its position in the Hebrew text, and it is the one followed by nearly every English version (BSB, NIV, NRSV, CEV, NCV, REB, NLT, NJPS, GW).
2. It refers specifically to the order Haman had issued. The king was saying that he could not cancel it, but he permitted Esther and Mordecai to write something of their own. This interpretation is followed by GNT, which reverses the order of the verse to express this:

    > But a proclamation issued in the king’s name and stamped with the royal seal cannot be revoked. You may, however, write to the Jews whatever you like; and you may write it in my name and stamp it with the royal seal. (GNT)

It is recommended that you follow the first option like the majority of the translations.

**a decree:** See note on 1:19a.

### Paragraph 8:9–14

There are many similarities between this passage and the section about Haman’s plot to kill the Jews. You should compare this passage with 3:12–15\.

#### 8:9a

**At once the royal scribes were summoned, and on the twenty\-third day of the third month (the month of Sivan),**

* ¶ Immediately, that same day, the 23rd day of the 3rd month, the month called Sivan, Esther and Mordecai sent for the people who wrote documents for the king.

**royal scribes:** See note on 3:12a.

**were summoned:** The text does not say who summoned the secretaries, but it was probably Mordecai and Esther, since the king had permitted them to issue the order.

**Sivan:** See the note about Tebeth in 2:16\. The month of Sivan was from mid\-May to mid\-June.

#### 8:9b

**they recorded all of Mordecai’s orders to the Jews and to the satraps, governors, and princes of the 127 provinces from India to Cush**

* They wrote down all the orders that Mordecai told them to write to the Jews and to the officials, governors, and administrators in the 127 provinces of the kingdom, from India all the way to Ethiopia.

**satraps:** See note on 3:12b.

**princes:** See note on 1:3b.

**from India to Cush:** See note on 1:1c.

#### 8:9c

**—writing to each province in its own script, to every people in their own language,**

* They wrote the documents in the language and way of writing of the people in each part of the kingdom.

**writing to each province in its own script, to every people in their own language:** The same instructions were given for the writing of these documents as for the original documents which Haman wrote. See 3:12–14\.

**script:** See note on 1:22b.

**in the name of King Xerxes:** See note on 3:12d. These letters had the same authority as Haman’s letters.

#### 8:10b

**and sealed it with the royal signet ring.**

* Then he sealed the documents with wax and stamped them with the king’s ring.

**sealed it with the royal signet ring:** See note on 3:12e.

#### 8:10c

**He sent the documents by mounted couriers**

* He gave the documents to messengers to deliver throughout the kingdom.

**mounted couriers:** This means messengers who rode on horses.

#### 8:10d

**riding on swift horses bred from the royal mares.**

* These men mounted on horses that could run fast, horses which people had bred especially for the king’s service, and left.

**swift horses:** The meaning of the word the BSB translates as “swift horses” is not certain. Most versions understand it to refer to horses which can run fast, and therefore the messengers could deliver messages throughout the kingdom as quickly as possible.

**bred from the royal mares:** This is another phrase which is difficult to understand in Hebrew. It probably refers to a group of horses which were specially bred not just for the king himself to ride, but also for officials to ride on state business.

* In these documents it said that the king would allow the Jews in each town to gather together and fight to defend themselves and their families if people attacked them.

**letters:** See note on 1:22a.

#### 8:11b

**to destroy, kill, and annihilate all the forces of any people or province hostile to them, including women and children,**

* It said that if people of any race from any province in the kingdom attacked them with weapons, the king would allow them to kill these people and completely destroy them all, men, women and children.

**destroy, kill, and annihilate:** See notes on 3:13b and 7:4a.

**including women and children:** The commentaries disagree about which women and children are being referred to. There are two possibilities:

1. It refers to the women and children of their attackers (BSB, NCV, CEV, NJPS, REB, GW, RSV).
2. It refers to the Jewish women and children (NIV, GNT, NLT).

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1\), since it is supported by most of the commentaries and is a more natural way to understand the Hebrew.

### Paragraph 8:15–17

These verses are in contrast to Esther 4:1–3\. Mordecai is dressed in royal robes instead of sackcloth, and there is general rejoicing instead of mourning.

#### 8:15a

**Mordecai went out from the presence of the king**

* ¶ Then/So Mordecai left the king’s presence.

#### 8:15b

**in royal garments of blue and white,**

* He was wearing blue and white garments like the king wore.
* He was wearing clothing in the king’s colors of blue and white.

#### 8:15c

**with a large gold crown and a purple robe of fine linen.**

* He also wore a coat made of fine purple cloth. On his head he wore a large crown made of gold.

**crown:** This is not the same word in Hebrew as was used in 1:11a, 2:17c and 6:8b. Perhaps a different word was used to make clear that Mordecai wasn’t wearing the king’s crown, but a different sort of hat.

**a purple robe of fine linen:** This probably means a long cloak or coat, worn over the other garments. It was made of a finely woven material called linen (see note on 1:6a).

**purple:** see note on 1:6b.

#### 8:15d

**And the city of Susa shouted and rejoiced.**

* When the people of Susa heard about the new law, they shouted because they were happy.

**And the city of Susa shouted and rejoiced:** It is not clear how this sentence is connected to the rest of the verse. Some commentators believe that the city rejoiced when they saw Mordecai in his official robes, but it is more likely that this phrase refers back to the news of the new law. When Haman’s order was issued, the people of the city were upset (see 3:15\), but now they rejoiced.

**shouted and rejoiced:** You should choose an expression in your language which means that the people made a lot of noise to show how happy they were when they heard the news.

These verses are in contrast to Esther 4:1–3\. Mordecai is dressed in royal robes instead of sackcloth, and there is general rejoicing instead of mourning.

#### 8:16

**For the Jews it was a time of light and gladness, of joy and honor.**

* Also the Jews in Susa were very happy and they celebrated with much joy.

**the Jews:** This probably refers to the Jews in Susa. Verse 17 refers to the rest of the Jews.

**light and gladness, of joy and honor:** You should choose words that express the joy and relief that the Jews felt when they heard that they were allowed to defend themselves if people attacked them. The words *light*, *gladness*, and *joy* all have similar meanings.

* But the opposite happened. Instead, the Jews gained control over those who hated them.

**their plan was overturned:** This means that the opposite happened. The Jews defeated their enemies, instead of their enemies defeating them.

**overpowered:** This means “gained control over, got them in their power.” This is the same verb in Hebrew as the BSB translated “overpower” in 9:1b.

**What have they done in the rest of the royal provinces?**

* They must have killed many more elsewhere in my kingdom.

**and rid themselves of their enemies. They killed 75,000 who hated them,**

* They killed 75,000 of the people who hated them and so got rid of their enemies.

**and rid themselves of their enemies:** The main difficulty in translating this verse is to decide how to relate this clause to the rest of the verse. All five clauses in this verse are connected by the simple Hebrew conjunction translated as “and.” There is no further indication how *rid themselves of their enemies* is related to the clauses which precede it and the one which follows it. So different versions have chosen different grammatical structures and punctuation to show the relationship between the clauses. There are two main interpretations:

1. Killing their enemies was the way in which the Jews got relief from their enemies, as in the GNT:

    > They rid themselves of their enemies by killing seventy\-five thousand people who hated them *(GNT, NJPS, NLT)*

2. The Jews gathered together to protect themselves and to kill their enemies, as in the NCV:

    > the Jewish people in the king’s empire also met to protect themselves and get rid of their enemies *(BSB, GW, NCV)*

Both structures are possible from the Hebrew. The Display follows GNT and is the recommended interpretation.

**rid themselves of:** The Hebrew verb which the BSB translates as *rid themselves of* could be translated “get rid of” or “free themselves from.”

#### 9:16c

**but they did not lay a hand on the plunder.**

* However, they too did not take for themselves anything belonging to the people they had killed.

* That is why the Jews who live in the smaller villages hold their celebrations on the 14th day of the month called Adar. They joyfully celebrate with feasts

**the rural Jews, who live in the villages:** The word which the BSB translates as *villages* means a small town or village which did not have a wall around it as bigger towns had.

**and the month in which their sorrow turned to joy and their mourning into a holiday.**

* and because this was the month when they had stopped being sad and became joyful; they had stopped weeping and began to celebrate.

**their sorrow turned to joy and their mourning into a holiday:** There are two parallel expressions in the Hebrew:

> their sorrow was turned into joy

> their mourning into a holiday

You could also combine these two expressions into one, as in the GNT:

> this was a month that had been turned from a time of grief and despair into a time of joy and happiness

#### 9:22c

**He wrote that these were to be days of feasting and joy,**

* So he told them to celebrate these days joyfully with feasts

**He wrote:** The BSB has added this to remind readers that this was still part of the instructions Mordecai gave in his letter.

**days of feasting and joy:** See note on 9:17c.

#### 9:22d

**of sending gifts to one another and to the poor.**

* and by giving gifts of food to each other and also giving things to the poor people.
* and by exchanging gifts of food with each other and providing for the poor people.

**sending gifts to one another:** This is the same expression as 9:19b and should be translated in the same way in both verses, since it refers to the same action.

**gifts…to the poor:** The Hebrew word which the BSB translates “gifts” is a general word which is related to the verb “to give.” The important thing is that, whereas the Jews were to exchange gifts of food with one another, when they gave to the poor they were not to expect a gift in return.

**For Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them**

* ¶ So this is why the Jews celebrated: Haman, son of Hammadatha, descendant of Agag, was an enemy of all the Jews and he had planned to destroy them.

**For:** This introduces a summary of the first eight chapters of Esther. It gives once more the reason for the festival of Purim and why it had that name. It may be what Mordecai wrote in his account (see 9:20\).

**Agagite:** See note on 3:1a.

#### 9:25a

**But when it came before the king,**

* But when the king heard about the plot,
* When the king heard that Haman planned to kill the Jews,

**when it came before the king:** Literally “when she came before the king.” It is not clear to whom the feminine pronoun “she” refers. There are two possibilities:

1. The word *it* to refer back to Haman’s plot, as in the BSB. This is grammatically possible because the Hebrew word translated “plot” is of feminine gender and so the pronoun used in this verse would be correct. *(BSB, NCV, GW, REB)*
2. The word *it*, which is feminine in Hebrew, refers to Esther. This seems logical because of what happened earlier in the story, but grammatically it is unlikely since Esther has not been mentioned by name since 9:13\. For example, the GNT has:

    > But Esther went to the king *(CEV, GNT, NJPS, NLT, NRSV)*

It is recommended that you follow the BSB (interpretation 1\).

#### 9:25b

**he commanded by letter that the wicked scheme which Haman had devised against the Jews should come back upon his own head,**

* he wrote an order, saying that his officials should do the same evil thing to Haman that he had planned to do to the Jews
* he told his secretaries to write his command that his officials should treat Haman in the same evil way that he had planned to treat the Jews

**should come back upon his own head:** That is, that he should suffer the very same fate that he had planned for the Jews.

#### 9:25c

**and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.**

* and that they should hang Haman and his ten sons on long poles.

**hanged on the gallows:** This refers back to two different events, those recorded in 7:9–10 and 9:13–14\.

**Therefore these days are called Purim, from the word Pur.**

* Because the lot which Haman cast was called “pur,” the days when the Jews celebrate this event are called Purim.

**Therefore:** This part of the verse is a parenthesis and refers back to 9:24b. You may need to state this reference explicitly. The Display shows one way to do this.

## Esther 9:28 (id: 513415)

### Section 9:20–32: How the Jews began to celebrate the festival called Purim

Mordecai sent out letters to tell the Jews to hold a celebration each year to remember the victory of the Jews over their enemies. This annual festival was called Purim because Haman had cast lots called purim to choose the best day to kill the Jews. Jews still celebrate this festival today.

#### 9:28a

**These days should be remembered and celebrated by every generation, family, province, and city,**

* They decided that every Jewish family everywhere in the kingdom, in every town and province, both now and in the future, should remember these events by celebrating the festival.

**by every generation:** This refers to the future as well as the present. You could state this explicitly, as in the GNT:

> “of every future generation

#### 9:28b

**so that these days of Purim should not fail to be observed among the Jews, nor should the memory of them fade from their descendants.**

* They decided that the Jews and their descendants should never forget the things that had happened and they should never stop celebrating the festival of Purim.

## Esther 9:29 (id: 513417)

### Section 9:20–32: How the Jews began to celebrate the festival called Purim

Mordecai sent out letters to tell the Jews to hold a celebration each year to remember the victory of the Jews over their enemies. This annual festival was called Purim because Haman had cast lots called purim to choose the best day to kill the Jews. Jews still celebrate this festival today.

#### 9:29

**So Queen Esther daughter of Abihail, along with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter concerning Purim.**

* ¶ Then Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, used her authority as queen and wrote another letter, helped by Mordecai the Jew. In it, she confirmed what Mordecai had written earlier about the festival of Purim.

There are many problems in this verse, and if you compare different English versions you will see that they differ from each other in many ways. These Notes give some of the reasons for the differences.

**along with Mordecai the Jew:** Some commentators and English versions change the place of this phrase in the verse (see, for example, NJPS, CEV, REB) or omit it altogether (JB, which follows the LXX). However, it is recommended that you follow the BSB, which is the majority view and the clearest way of understanding the Hebrew text.

**with full authority:** The Hebrew word which the BSB translates “authority” literally means “strength, power.” Here it is referring to the authority Esther had as queen.

**to confirm this second letter:** This is a very difficult expression to understand. It seems clear from the context that *this second letter* refers to the letter Esther (and Mordecai) were now writing. The first letter was, then, the letter Mordecai wrote in 9:20\. This is the view of most commentators. It is difficult, however, to understand how a letter can confirm itself. It would make more sense if this letter was written to confirm the letter which Mordecai had written (in 9:20\). This is how a number of versions have translated it (GNT, NCV, NJPS). If a literal translation of this phrase would be difficult to understand in your language, you could follow one of these versions. See, for example, the NCV:

> they wrote to prove the first letter was true

**Purim:** See note on 3:7b.

## Esther 9:30 (id: 513420)

### Section 9:20–32: How the Jews began to celebrate the festival called Purim

Mordecai sent out letters to tell the Jews to hold a celebration each year to remember the victory of the Jews over their enemies. This annual festival was called Purim because Haman had cast lots called purim to choose the best day to kill the Jews. Jews still celebrate this festival today.

#### 9:30

**And Mordecai sent letters with words of peace and truth to all the Jews in the 127 provinces of the kingdom of Xerxes,**

* So Mordecai sent these letters with kind and sincere words to all the Jews in the 127 provinces of Xerxes’ kingdom, saying

**And Mordecai sent:** The Hebrew is more literally “and he sent.” From the context, it means Mordecai, so this is how the BSB has translated it (also NCV, GW). However other versions understand the verb to be a passive (RSV, GNT, CEV, NJPS, NLT, REB).. If you have a passive in your language, it is recommended that you use it here:

> letters were sent

**peace:** The Hebrew word here, *šalom*, is often translated “peace,” but it is a word that has many different meanings. Here the literal expression “words of peace” probably means “kind words” or “friendly words.”

**truth:** Here the literal expression “words of truth” probably means “sincere words.”

## Esther 9:31 (id: 513422)

### Section 9:20–32: How the Jews began to celebrate the festival called Purim

Mordecai sent out letters to tell the Jews to hold a celebration each year to remember the victory of the Jews over their enemies. This annual festival was called Purim because Haman had cast lots called purim to choose the best day to kill the Jews. Jews still celebrate this festival today.

#### 9:31a

**in order to confirm these days of Purim at their appointed time,**

* that the Jews should make an agreement to celebrate the festival of Purim at the time which Mordecai had chosen,

**Purim:** See note on 3:7b.

#### 9:31b

**just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had established them**

* just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had ordered them to.

#### 9:31c

**and had committed themselves and their descendants to the times of fasting and lamentation.**

* They should make an agreement to celebrate Purim on those days each year just as they had made an agreement that they and their descendants should keep certain other days for fasting and crying to God.

**the times of fasting and lamentation:** The Hebrew is more literally “words of fasting and lamentation.” It probably is a way of referring to certain Jewish holidays. The Jews were in the habit of commemorating certain traumatic events in their history by holding annual fasts. So this verse is saying that they should establish this holiday (Purim) just as they had established these other holidays.1 Scholars differ in how they believe this phrase should be connected grammatically to the rest of the verb and whether they believe this phrase refers to Purim itself or to other holidays which the Jews celebrated. Many English versions are unclear. The majority interpretation is the one discussed in the Notes. It is followed by NJPS, NIV, RSV, GW and GNT and takes the phrase “times of fasting and lamentation” as the object of the verb which the BSB translates “established.” The JB follows a different interpretation which believes that the verse says that fasting and lamentation were to be included in the way Purim was to be celebrated. So the JB has “with additional ordinances for fasts and lamentations.”

**fasting:** See note on 4:3b.

**lamentation:** This refers to pleading with God for something with tears, not to mourning for the dead.

## Esther 9:32 (id: 513423)

### Section 9:20–32: How the Jews began to celebrate the festival called Purim

Mordecai sent out letters to tell the Jews to hold a celebration each year to remember the victory of the Jews over their enemies. This annual festival was called Purim because Haman had cast lots called purim to choose the best day to kill the Jews. Jews still celebrate this festival today.

#### 9:32a

**So Esther’s decree confirmed these regulations about Purim,**

* The orders which Esther wrote in her letter confirmed the rules that the Jews were to keep about celebrating the festival of Purim.

**decree:** See note on 1:19a.

**these regulations about Purim:** That is, the rules about how and when they were to celebrate the festival.

#### 9:32b

**which were written into the record.**

* And Esther told the secretaries to write the orders down in the official books.

## Esther 10:1 (id: 513424)

### Section 10:1–3: Mordecai received honor in all the kingdom of Xerxes

The book began with a reference to the greatness of King Xerxes. It ends with how the king honored Mordecai, one of the heroes of the story.

#### 10:1

**Now King Xerxes imposed tribute throughout the land, even to its farthest shores.**

* ¶ King Xerxes demanded that the people everywhere in his kingdom even as far as the edge of the sea, should pay taxes to him.

**tribute:** The Hebrew is more “forced labor.” However the word also came to mean *tribute*, a sort of tax which the king made the people throughout his kingdom pay. Because of the expenses of the long war against Greece, the king needed money. These taxes would have been paid mainly by food which the people grew or by animals which they reared.

**throughout the land, even to its farthest shores:** Literally “upon the land and the regions of the sea.” Scholars differ in how they understand this, especially the expression “the regions of the sea.” The two main possibilities are:

1. “Regions of the sea” means the coast, as distinguished from the interior (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NLT).
2. “Regions of the sea” means the islands, as distinguished from the mainland (NJPS, GW, CEV, JB).

The expression “regions of the sea” can mean either. The important thing is that the expression “upon the land and the regions of the sea” means that the whole empire was included, and you should make sure that your translation makes this clear.

## Esther 10:2 (id: 513428)

### Section 10:1–3: Mordecai received honor in all the kingdom of Xerxes

The book began with a reference to the greatness of King Xerxes. It ends with how the king honored Mordecai, one of the heroes of the story.

#### 10:2a

**And all of Mordecai’s powerful and magnificent accomplishments,**

* The royal secretaries wrote down all the great things the king had done throughout the time he was king,

**all of Mordecai’s powerful and magnificent accomplishments:** Literally “all the work of his power and his authority.” The versions understand the pronoun “his” in two ways:

1. It refers to King Xerxes. This interpretation is followed by the majority of English versions: *(CEV, GNT, GW, JB, NCV, NIV, NLT, REB)*
2. It refers to Mordecai. BSB follows this interpretation.

It is recommended that you follow the first interpretation (1\), like the majority of English versions.

**powerful and magnificent:** The two words *powerful* and *magnificent* are synonyms. They refer to the great things the king did.

#### 10:2b

**together with the full account of the greatness to which the king had raised him,**

* and also all about how great Mordecai had become because the king had honored him.

#### 10:2c

**are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia?**

* The secretaries wrote all these things in the book about what the kings of Media and Persia had done.

This is a rhetorical question. The Display shows one way of expressing it as a statement.

**Book of the Chronicles:** See note on 2:23c.
