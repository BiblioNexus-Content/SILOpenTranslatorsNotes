He also greeted the people to whom he was writing.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Before you begin to translate this section, consider what is the natural way to begin a letter in your language. Consider also how closely to follow that way in your translation.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Consider whether or not you want a section heading here. The GNT, for example, does not have one here. It is good to read or translate this section before you decide on a heading for it. Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul introduced himself and the gospel about Jesus and greeted the Roman believers</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul and His Message of Good News (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul began his letter to the Christians in Rome</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">From</span> Paul, the Christ/Messiah Jesus’ slave,</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I,</span> Paul, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">write this letter.</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span> do the work of Jesus, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he/who is</span> the Deliverer <span data-bnType=\"implied\">whom God promised to send</span>.</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">This letter is from me,</span> Paul. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span> serve Jesus, the one/person whom God appointed to save/rescue <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Paul:</strong> The author of this letter is named <em>Paul</em>. He began this letter with his name. This was the normal way to begin a letter at that time in that region.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul did not use a sentence here. In some languages it is more natural to introduce the writer in a different way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>From Paul, (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This letter is from Paul, (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I,</span> Paul, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">am writing this letter.</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a servant of:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>servant</em> refers to a slave. Here, this phrase indicates that Paul belonged to Jesus as his slave. Paul served him and completely submitted himself to the authority of Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">People often despised servants or slaves. But when someone called himself a slave of Jesus, as Paul did here, he was not ashamed of it. You may have more than one word to describe servants or slaves. Choose the one that indicates or implies the believer’s good relationship to Jesus. That is why many English versions use the word <em>servant</em> instead of slave.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a slave of (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a worker of/for</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you have translated other books, see how you translated this word in Galatians 1:10, Philippians 1:1, Titus 1:1, or James 1:1.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it will be best to translate the word <em>servant</em> as a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I serve</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I completely submit to</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I do the work of</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Christ Jesus:</strong> There is a textual issue here about the order of the words <em>Christ Jesus</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The correct order is <u>Christ Jesus</u>. <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NABRE, ESV, NLT, CEV, NET, REB, NCV)</em></p></li><li><p>The correct order is <u>Jesus Christ</u>. <em>(RSV, KJV, GW)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) because the UBS Greek New Testament supports it.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The UB5 says that the order <u>Christ Jesus</u> “is almost certain.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The order of the words <em>Christ Jesus</em> emphasizes that Jesus is the Christ/Messiah. However, in some languages the order <em>Christ Jesus</em> is not natural. If that is true in your language, emphasize, if possible, the fact that Jesus is the Christ in a natural way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Jesus, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who/he is the</span> Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Jesus, the Messiah,</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ:</strong> This name is spelled “<em>Christos”</em> in the Greek language. (The Greek sound spelled ‘ch’ here is similar to a ‘k’ but without making the air stop in the mouth.) Spell the name as people in your language say it, or use the name from the common language in your region.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>Christ</em> was used as a title. It was the Greek translation of the Hebrew word “Messiah.” It means “the anointed one.” In the Jewish culture a person was anointed by pouring oil on top of his head in a ceremony. This was done to show that God chose him for a special task/job. In the Old Testament, some were anointed to be priests, some to be kings, and some to be prophets. In the Old Testament, “the anointed one” refers to the person whom God promised would save/free his people and rule them.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example, see Isaiah 61:1 and Psalm 2.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are other ways to translate <em>Christ</em>:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a title or a descriptive phrase in your language that has the same meaning as <em>Christ</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> Anointed/Chosen One</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Messiah</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Promised Deliverer</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Rescuer-King whom God appointed</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Transliterate <em>Christ</em> and include a phrase that explains the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Karisiti, the appointed one</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Cristo, the King whom God promised to send</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Transliterate <em>Christ</em> and indicate in some way that it is a title. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Kirisita</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">If you do not indicate the meaning of <em>Christ</em> in your translation, you may want to include a footnote to explain it. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The word/title “Christ” refers to the one whom God had promised to send. He would be both king and savior.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Or you may want to explain the meaning in a glossary.</p><h4>1:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>called to be an apostle,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">his</span> appointed/authorized apostle,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He</span> called me, and I became <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his</span> representative/apostle.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He</span> chose me as <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his special</span> messenger/envoy.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>called to be an apostle:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>called to be an apostle</em> is literally “(a) called apostle.” Here the word <em>called</em> means “chosen to be given a special benefit or purpose.” God invited Paul to do the work of an apostle (1 Timothy 1:1). Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">his</span> appointed apostle</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>an apostle by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> call/choice</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages must use a verb here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>called as an apostle (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>called by God to be an apostle (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> invited me to be an apostle</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>an apostle whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he/God</span> <u>chose</u></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>an apostle:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>apostle</em> means a “representative” or “messenger.” It refers to a person whom someone sends with his authority. He is sent to give a message or accomplish a particular task. Here, the word <em>apostle</em> refers to Paul whom Jesus sent as his messenger. Paul’s message was the gospel about Jesus. Here are other ways to translate <em>apostle</em>:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his/Jesus’ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">special</span> representative</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ’s/his messenger</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a man whom Jesus Christ sent (on a mission)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a person with authority <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from Jesus Christ to do his work</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the common word for the word apostle if it is already in use. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>apostol</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use the same term for <em>apostle</em> as you used in the Gospels. (See Mark 6:30 or Luke 6:13.) Be sure that the term you choose for apostle is different from your terms for prophet (1:2) and angel (8:38).</p><h4>1:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and set apart for the gospel of God—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and put/placed in a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">special</span> position <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to preach</span> the good news <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that is</span> from God.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He</span> chose <span data-bnType=\"implied\">me to tell people</span> his good message that God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">announced</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He</span> caused <span data-bnType=\"implied\">me</span> to dedicate all my life <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in preaching/telling</span> the joyful news <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about Jesus</span>, which God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">proclaimed/sent</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">This clause also describes Paul (1:1a). God set him apart for the preaching of the gospel. In Greek and the BSB, the sentence continues from 1:1b. But in some languages, a new sentence would be more clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God set me apart for his gospel</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>set apart for the gospel of God:</strong> The phrase <em>set apart</em> indicates that God chose Paul from among a group of people to do a specific task. He chose Paul to be a messenger to tell the gospel to the non-Jews (1:5). Here are other ways to translate these words:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>separated to serve the gospel of God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">he/Jesus/God</span> caused me to dedicate all my life for the gospel of God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God set me apart for the gospel <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about Jesus</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated the phrase <em>set apart</em> in Acts 13:2 or Galatians 1:15.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for:</strong> Here the word <em>for</em> introduces a purpose clause. God set Paul apart from other work for the purpose of preaching or sharing the gospel. Here are other ways to translate <em>for</em>:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in order that</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>The reason</u> he chose me to be an apostle was <u>so that</u><span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Western Bukidnon Manobo Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>to</u> speak/tell God’s good news<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the gospel of God:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>gospel</em> means “good news” or “announcement of a message that people consider very good.” Here, it refers to the good news that God sent Jesus to save us from wrongdoing and reconcile us to God. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>good/sweet news from God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s message/report that causes joy</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>good news <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about Jesus Christ</span> that God sent</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>of God:</strong> The word <em>of</em> here indicates that the gospel is from God. See the examples above.</p>",

Then in 1:2–4 he told some details about that gospel. In the Greek and the BSB, the sentence continues from 1:1c. But in some languages, a new sentence would be more clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He promised it beforehand…</p></blockquote><h4>1:2a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the gospel He promised beforehand through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures:</strong> The words that the BSB translates as <em>the gospel He promised beforehand</em> is literally “which he [previously] promised.” The BSB supplies the word <em>gospel</em> to clearly show that this clause further describes the gospel mentioned in 1:1c. It does not separate this gospel from other gospels. Another way to translate this phrase is to make it a separate sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He promised it beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures.</p></blockquote><h4>1:2a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the gospel He promised beforehand</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He promised it long ago</p></li><li><p>This good message he/God promised <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to the Jews</span> in old times,</p></li><li><p>Regarding this joyful news, God/he promised <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to his people Israel</span> long/very long ago to show it.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He promised beforehand:</strong> This clause indicates that long ago God promised to send the Messiah, who the Messiah would be, what he would do, and what would happen to him. All those things are the gospel of the Messiah. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that he promised long ago (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This good news God promised in old times<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Yakan Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><h4>1:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">means of</span> his prophets in the holy Scriptures</p></li><li><p>and he caused his spokesmen for God to write it in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his</span> very own, special Book.</p></li><li><p>He told/commanded it to the Jewish prophets <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and they wrote it</span> in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his</span> sacred Book.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>through His prophets:</strong> The word <em>through</em> indicates that God gave messages about the gospel to the prophets for them to tell the people. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>by means of his prophets</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>by telling his prophets what to write</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>which he caused-to-be-written by the prophets through-whom-he-spoke<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>prophets:</strong> The word <em>prophets</em> refers to people who speak on behalf of God. God’s message (often called a “prophecy”) may be in words or visions. A prophet then tells the people God’s message. It may reveal something about a past, present, or future event, or it may reveal someone’s thoughts, motives, or attitudes. It is not like a sermon, prepared by the preacher’s study of the Bible, but God may inspire a preacher with a prophecy during a sermon. The person speaks the prophecy to the people or writes it down for their use. Here are other ways to translate the word <em>prophets</em>:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>spokespeople for God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those who speak/bring God’s message/words</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s message-speakers</p></blockquote></li><li><p>If the translated meaning of <em>prophets</em> is unclear, use the major language word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>porofets</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">It is good to use a general term that does not focus only on foretelling the future. Although prophets did foretell the future, they also gave people other messages from God. They especially told them to stop doing what is wrong and to obey God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Be sure that the term you choose for prophet (1:2b) is different from your terms for apostle (1:1b), angel (8:38), and preach (1:15).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Holy Scriptures:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>Holy Scriptures</em> refers to the books of the Old Testament.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are other ways to translate <em>the Holy Scriptures</em>:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the sacred writings <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of God</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the writings <span data-bnType=\"implied\">which are</span> holy</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s special message <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that they wrote</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Holy:</strong> The word <em>Holy</em> in this context means “sacred” or “originates from God.” Holy is used here to emphasize that these Scriptures come from God and therefore, are trustworthy and have God’s authority. See above examples.</p>",

The gospel is about Jesus. Here are four things Paul said about the gospel in 1:3–4.</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>God’s Son became a human being.</p></li><li><p>His Son was a descendant of King David.</p></li><li><p>After God’s Son died, God made him alive again and appointed him to be in a position of power as the Son of God.</p></li><li><p>The name of God’s Son is Jesus.

Here this phrase does not connect to “the holy Scriptures” in 1:2b. In some languages the connection back to 1:1c will need to be made explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the gospel</span> concerning his Son</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In the Greek, the sentence continues from 1:2b. In some languages it would be more natural to begin a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The/That gospel</span> concerns his Son</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>regarding:</strong> This word indicates that this gospel is about God’s Son, Jesus. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>concerning (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>about (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His Son:</strong> The phrase <em>His Son</em> refers to Jesus. He is God’s Son. It indicates that the relationship between God and Jesus is similar to the relationship of human fathers and their sons. They have a Father-Son kind of relationship. They love each other, and sons obey their fathers. This term also implies that Jesus has the same nature as God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">God does not have a physical body, and he did not cause Jesus to exist the way a human father causes a son to exist. Jesus existed eternally as the Son with his Father.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation gives the wrong meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate literally and explain its correct meaning in a footnote. Here is an example footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This title refers to Jesus. It indicates the relationship between God and Jesus is similar to the relationship of human fathers and sons. It also implies that Jesus and God are the same kind of being. Jesus has been God’s Son for all eternity.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Explain its meaning of an eternal relationship of a son to a father. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his <span data-bnType=\"implied\">divine/heavenly</span> Son</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">eternal</span> Most Beloved of God as a Son</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages there is no single word for <em>Son</em>. If that is true in your language, use a more general word, such as “child.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his Child</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Child of God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Other verses will usually make clear that Jesus was a male child. If you use a descriptive phrase such as “male child of God,” be sure that this phrase does not imply that God had another child who was female.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:2a–3a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">1:2a–b is extra information about the gospel. In 1:3a he resumed his discussion about the gospel from 1:1c. In some languages the extra information must be in a separate sentence. Consider how to indicate that in your translation.

As his Son, God appointed Jesus to a new position of power and authority as Savior, Lord, and Judge. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>was <u>appointed</u> the Son-of-God-in-power (NET) <em>(RSV, NJB, NIV11, NET, NABRE, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Here this word means <u>declare</u>. God made known to others who Jesus already was. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who was declared the Son of God with power (NASB) <em>(BSB, NIV, NASB, ESV, NRSV, KJV, REB, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Here this word means <u>show clearly</u> or <u>prove</u>. God showed to others by some action who Jesus already was. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he <u>was shown</u> with great power to be the Son of God (GNT) <em>(GNT, CEV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because the verb means “set limits” and the figurative use from that is “appoint.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kittel (page 728). Cranfield (pages 61–62) says, “It came to be used very frequently with the meaning, ‘fix,’ ‘determine’, ‘appoint’; and this is the sense it has in all its other occurrences in the NT. No clear example, either earlier than, or contemporary with, the NT, of its use in the sense ‘declare’ or ‘show to be’ has been adduced.”</span></span> The verb does not refer to a speech act such as “declare” or an act of proving something.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Issue 2: Connection of</u> <u><em>with power</em></u></p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are several ways to interpret how the words <em>with power</em> connect to the rest of the sentence:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It connects to the words <u><em>the Son of God</em></u>. At the resurrection the Son of God had new power. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>was appointed the Son-of-God-in-power<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NET uses hyphens (-) to show that those words with hyphens are connected to each other.</span></span> (NET) <em>(RSV, NJB, NIV11, NASB, NABRE, ESV, CEV, NET, KJV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It connects to the Greek verb that means <u><em>was declared</em></u>. It indicates that God powerfully designated Jesus to be the Son of God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>was declared with power to be the Son of God (NIV) <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It connects to <u>the Holy Spirit</u>. The Holy Spirit worked powerfully when God designated Jesus to be the Son of God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he was shown to be the Son of God when he was raised from the dead by the power of the Holy Spirit (NLT) <em>(NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because it is the most natural connection in the Greek.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Edwards (pages 29–30) says, “The resurrection, however, separates the two stages or time periods. It is a dividing line not in Jesus’ status as Son of God, but in his function as Son of God. As seed of David Jesus was the Son in humility; as Son of God in power he enters his role as exalted Lord. At the resurrection Jesus was constituted Son of God <em>in power</em>, whereas before the resurrection he had been Son of God in suffering. Thus, verses 3–4 are not about Jesus’ promotion or adoption as God’s Son. Both parts of the formula are <strong>regarding</strong> God’s <strong>Son</strong> (v.3), but God’s Son in two manifestations: as servant and Lord, in humiliation and exaltation, in earthly ministry and heavenly reign.” Cranfield, Fee, Fitzmyer, Hultgren, Matera, Moo, Morris, Nygren, Osborne, Schreiner, Stott, Talbert, Vanlaningham, Witherington, and Ziesler also support interpretation (1).</span></span> Here are other ways to translate this phrase according to interpretation (1):</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who was appointed the Son of God in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a new and</span> powerful way</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>was established as the empowered Son of God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>was declared:</strong> This verb has the same subject as 1:3b: “the one” in the Greek. This clause indicates a second thing about the Son of God (1:3a). In some languages the subject must be repeated here. For example, the BSB supplies the word “who” at the beginning of 1:4a. This clause is also passive. Some languages must use an active clause here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> designated/appointed him</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Son of God:</strong> Here the phrase <em>the Son of God</em> refers to the same person as “his Son” in 1:3a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s Son/Child</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s <span data-bnType=\"implied\">divine/heavenly</span> Son</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you need to, see the note on “his Son” at 1:3 for more explanation.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>through:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>through</em> here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>according to</u> or <u>with regard to</u> here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>according to (RSV) <em>(RSV, GNT, NJB, NASB, ESV, KJV, NET, REB, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>through</u> or <u>by means of</u> here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>through the Spirit of holiness (NIV) <em>(BSB, NIV, NLT, NABRE, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) because the sense of meaning given in interpretation (2) is extremely rare and the context is not correct for it here.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The only phrase in the entire Greek New Testament which interprets <em>kata</em> with accusative case as “through” or “by means of” occurs in Matthew 1:20, 2:12, 2:13, 2:19, 2:22, and 27:19. The same phrase “in a dream” (<em>kat</em> <em>onar</em>) occurs in each of these six verses. But the use of <em>kata</em> here does not involve a dream. Cranfield (page 64) says, “we are inclined to think that the most probable explanation is that which (taking <em>kata</em> as meaning ‘according to’) understands the phrase to refer to the Holy Spirit, who, as given by the exalted Christ, is the manifestation of His power and majesty, and so the guarantee of his having been appointed Son of God in might.” Young (pages 98–99) says, “The idea of ‘with regard to’ is expressed by <em>kata</em> with the accusative in Romans 1:3–4.” Young also does not include “<u>means</u>” as an option for <em>any</em> occurrence of <em>kata</em>. Also see Fee (pages 480–481).</span></span> Here are other ways to translate the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>through</em>:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as to (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>with reference to</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in terms of (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The same phrase “according to” is used in 1:3b. If possible, translate “according to” the same in both places.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Spirit of holiness:</strong> There are four ways to interpret the phrase <em>the Spirit of holiness</em> here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Here the word <em>Spirit</em> refers to <u>God’s Spirit (the Holy Spirit)</u>, and the words <em>of holiness</em> indicates that <u>he causes believers to be holy (or caused Jesus to be holy while he was on earth)</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Spirit of holiness (RSV) <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, NJB, NASB, ESV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Here the word <em>Spirit</em> refers to <u>God’s Spirit</u>, and the words <em>of holiness</em> indicates that <u>he is holy</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Holy Spirit (NET) <em>(NET, REB, CEV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Here the word <em>Spirit</em> indicates that <u>Jesus is God</u> and the words <em>of holiness</em> indicates that <u>Jesus is holy</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his divine holiness (GNT) <em>(GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Here the word <em>Spirit</em> refers to <u>Jesus’ own human spirit</u>, and the words <em>of holiness</em> indicates that <u>his spirit is characterized by holiness</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the spirit of holiness (NRSV) <em>(NRSV, GW, NABRE, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because the Greek word translated <em>of holiness</em> here is not the normal word used in the phrase “Holy Spirit.” Something more than the normal meaning of “Holy Spirit” seems indicated here.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Cranfield (page 64) says, “Paul may well have used <em>hagiōsunēs</em> in order to bring out specially the thought of sanctification.” Jewett (page 107) says, “The key to the new ethic is giving oneself as a holy sacrifice for others (12:1). In this sense, the insertion of the term ‘holiness’ prepares the reader for a major emphasis in the letter.” There are several instances in Paul’s writings of the phrase “the Spirit who gives/supplies [something].” Interpretation (1) is another instance of a phrase like that. See John 15:26, Rom 8:2, Eph 1:17, 2 Tim 1:7.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Spirit:</strong> Here the word <em>Spirit</em> refers to the Spirit of God, usually called the Holy Spirit. Use the same word for <em>Spirit</em> as you have in other books where you have translated “Holy Spirit” (for example: Matthew 1:18, Mark 1:8, Luke 1:15, or John 1:33).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>of:</strong> The word <em>of</em> here can indicate that:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Spirit <u>causes</u> believers to be holy.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Wallace (page 106) genitive of product [which produces]. He mentions Romans 1:5 “(perhaps)” as an example of this genitive category. He does not list Romans 1:5 under any other genitive category. He lists “the God of hope” (Romans 15:13), “the God of peace” (Romans 15:33), and “the God of steadfastness and of encouragement” (Romans 15:5) as clear examples of the genitive of product. Therefore, it makes good sense to include “the Spirit of holiness” under this category.</span></span></p></li><li><p>The Spirit <u>is characterized by</u> holiness.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Wallace (page 79), descriptive genitive. He also says that this category should only be used when no other category fits. But the descriptive genitive is possible here.</span></span></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Here the Greek language allows either interpretation, as does the English word <em>of</em>. If possible translate in a way that allows either interpretation. But if you must choose, choose interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Fee (page 484) says, “the Spirit who gives/supplies holiness…anticipates much of the argument of the rest of the letter…. If Christ is both the content and therefore the source of the gospel, offering ‘God’s righteousness’ freely to all who trust him, then the Spirit…is not simply the Holy Spirit, but the Spirit of holiness itself—the one who effects the ‘righteousness of God’ in the lives of the believing community, Jew and Gentile together, in terms of their individual and corporate behavior.” Moo (on TW), Jewett (pages 106–107), and Wallace (pages 250–251) also support interpretation (1).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he/who <u>produces</u></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he/who <u>causes</u></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>holiness:</strong> Here the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>holiness</em> refers to living a good, morally pure life and being free from sin. The Holy Spirit causes believers to live this kind of life.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Moo (on TW) says that the new era is “characterized by righteousness, life, and the…gift of the Holy Spirit.” Jewett (pages 106–107) says that “holiness” is about moral obligations, and that “such obligations are developed at length in Romans 5–8. In this sense, the insertion of the term ‘holiness’ prepares the reader for a major emphasis in the letter.”</span></span> Here are other ways to translate it:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>be set apart <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from sin</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">spiritual</span> purity</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>moral integrity <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in us</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">us to</span> depart from evil</p></blockquote><h4>1:4b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:4b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>by His resurrection from the dead:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>from the resurrection of him from the dead.</p></li><li><p>by the means of raising him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to life</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">again</span> from the dead.</p></li><li><p>when <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he/God</span> caused him to leave the spirits of dead people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and be alive again</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by:</strong> Here the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>by</em> is literally “from.” Here it probably indicates that God raising Jesus from the dead was the way that God appointed him as the powerful Son of God. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>through</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>by means of</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It is also possible that “from” means “when” or “because” here. But <em>by</em> seems most likely.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Fee (page 481) says, “Jesus came <em>from</em> the lineage of David (and) was declared Son of God with power <em>from</em> (=stemming from; on the basis of) his resurrection from the dead.” Also, 8:11 indicates that the Spirit is the means by which God raised Jesus from the dead (Kruse, page 46).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>His resurrection from the dead:</strong> The BSB adds the word <em>His</em> here. It is implied from the context. God made Jesus alive again after he was dead. He raised Jesus back to life out from among those who are dead. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he was raised from death (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>raising <span data-bnType=\"implied\">him</span> from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the</span> dead</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>causing <span data-bnType=\"implied\">him</span> to live again after he had died</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">When God caused Jesus to live again, he had the same identity that he had before he died. The same thing is true for this word in the Bible when referring to other people. The Greek word “<em>anastasis</em>” and the English word <em>resurrection</em> do not imply that a person will live again as a different person or as an animal.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>from the dead:</strong> The word <em>from</em> here indicates that God makes a dead person alive and takes him away from the place where the spirits of dead people live.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Wallace (pages 107–109).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>out of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the realm of the</span> dead</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Also see the examples above.</p><h4>1:4c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:4c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Jesus Christ our Lord.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">That person is</span> Jesus, the Christ/Messiah, our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He is</span> our Master/Leader Jesus, the Deliverer/Rescuer!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">This phrase names who the “Son of God” (1:4a) is. In the Greek and the BSB the sentence continues from 1:4b. In some languages, making that connection explicit here would be more natural or more clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the Son of God is</span> Jesus Christ our Lord</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek and the BSB, the sentence continues from 1:4b.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>3</sup>It is about <u>his Son, our Lord Jesus Christ</u>: as to his humanity, he was born a descendant of David; <sup>4</sup>as to his divine holiness, he was shown with great power to be the Son of God by being raised from death.

He also greeted the people to whom he was writing.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Before you begin to translate this section, consider what is the natural way to begin a letter in your language. Consider also how closely to follow that way in your translation.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Consider whether or not you want a section heading here. The GNT, for example, does not have one here. It is good to read or translate this section before you decide on a heading for it. Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul introduced himself and the gospel about Jesus and greeted the Roman believers</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul and His Message of Good News (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul began his letter to the Christians in Rome</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:5a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:5a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Through Him and on behalf of His name,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Through whom/him, to make his name great,</p></li><li><p>This will cause all people to honor Jesus Christ: through him,</p></li><li><p>To make his name great, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> enabled him</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul talked about the gospel in 1:2a–1:4c. In 1:5a he again discussed more about himself and his work for Jesus. But he connected his next words to “Jesus Christ our Lord” with “through Him.” In the Greek, the sentence continues. However, the BSB begins a new sentence here. In some languages, a new sentence here would be more natural or more clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Through him we have received… (NABRE)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Through Him and on behalf of His name:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>Through Him</em> is literally “through whom.” This clause further describes Jesus. It does not separate this Jesus from other men named Jesus. For the correct meaning in some languages, translators must avoid the word “whom.” The word <em>Through</em> indicates that Paul received grace and apostleship by means of Jesus. God enabled Jesus to give Paul grace and apostleship. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>by the authority given to him he gave to us</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> enabled him to give us</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> gave power to Jesus and so he/Jesus was kind to us and gave us the work of being apostles</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>on behalf of His name:</strong> This phrase refers to helping, causing advantage for, or honoring the one named. The apostles taught others about Jesus, spread the news of Jesus, and did good deeds in his name.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to say “him” instead of <em>His name</em> here. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for the honor of his name (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for him (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to benefit him</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase connects to the end of the clause (1:5c). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>…<sup>5c</sup>of winning the obedience of faith among all the nations <sup>5a</sup><u>for the honour of his name</u> (NJB)</p></blockquote><h4>1:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>we received grace and apostleship</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>we<sup>(excl)</sup> received the grace/gift to be <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his</span> apostles,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> was kind to us by making us his apostles/representatives,</p></li><li><p>to give us the privilege/gift of becoming his special messengers,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we received:</strong> In English, the word <em>received</em> implies someone gave what was received. The English word “take” does not imply that someone gave it. It is implied here that God graciously gave Paul and others apostleship.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Many languages have the same word for both “receive” and “take.” In some of those languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that God did not graciously give apostleship but Paul just took it. If that is true in your language, you should use “give” here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>have been given</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">he</span> has given</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we:</strong> Sometimes in NT letters, the writer referred to himself with <em>we</em> instead of “I.” There are two ways to interpret the word <em>we</em> here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Paul referred to <u>himself and others</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we (NET) <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, NJB, NASB, NABRE, ESV, KJV, NET, GW, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Paul referred to <u>himself</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I (REB) <em>(GNT, NCV, CEV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because Paul consistently used the first person singular to refer to his apostolic mission in the rest of Romans, but he used <em>we</em> here instead. So, he probably had a reason <u>not</u> to use “I” here.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Dunn (page 16) says, “Somewhat unexpectedly (in view of v 1) Paul links others with himself—<em>we</em> received. He does not regard himself as the sole apostle to the Gentiles, which would in any case have been a difficult position to maintain in writing to a largely Gentile church which he had not founded.” Barrett, Cranfield, Jewett, Fitzmyer, Stott, Schreiner, and Witherington also support interpretation (1).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>grace and apostleship:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the phrase <em>grace and apostleship</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>This is a figure of speech that means <u>gracious apostleship</u>. In kindness, God made Paul and others apostles. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the privilege of being an apostle (GNT) <em>(GNT, NABRE, REB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>This is not a figure of speech, but refers to two things, <u>grace and apostleship</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>grace and apostleship (RSV) <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, NJB, NASB, ESV, KJV, NET, GW, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because Paul was establishing his apostleship in these verses and not speaking generally of God’s grace to us.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The technical word for the figure of speech in interpretation (1) is hendiadys. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language says, “Hendiadys is a figure of speech in which two words connected by a conjunction are used to express a single notion that would normally be expressed by an adjective and a substantive.” Many scholars support interpretation (1). For example, Cranfield (pages 65–66) says that it is not necessary for Paul to write that he has received grace in a general sense at this point in Romans. Instead Paul wrote about his authority as an apostle and that he received it not because of any merit of his own.</span></span> Here are other ways to translate this phrase according to interpretation (1):</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">free</span> gift of apostleship</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the grace that enabled us to be apostles</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the privilege and authority as apostles (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he was kind, giving us the work of apostles</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>grace:</strong> This word refers to kindness that is given to people without requiring anything in return. This kindness is not given because they have done anything to deserve it. See the examples above.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>apostleship:</strong> The word <em>apostleship</em> refers to the work that an apostle does. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to be an/his apostle</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>becoming his <span data-bnType=\"implied\">special</span> representative</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated “apostle” in 1:1.</p><h4>1:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to call all those among the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that people among the non-Jews would believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the good news</span> and therefore obey <span data-bnType=\"implied\">him/Christ</span>.</p></li><li><p>in order that people would obey <span data-bnType=\"implied\">him/Jesus</span> because they believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in him</span>, including those among all people groups who are not Jews.</p></li><li><p>so that the Gentiles’ faith causes them to obey <span data-bnType=\"implied\">it</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to call…to…obedience:</strong> The word <em>to</em> introduces the purpose of being an apostle: <em>to call</em> the Gentiles to obey the gospel of Jesus. The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>to call…to…obedience</em> is literally “unto/to obedience.” Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for the obedience of those among the Gentiles</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that the people among the Gentiles would obey</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to lead people…to…obey (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>all those among the Gentiles:</strong> This phrase connects to the phrase “the obedience of faith.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the obedience of faith <u>among all the nations</u> for the honour of his name (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Gentiles</em> here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to <u>all people groups, excluding the Jews</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>all the Gentiles (NIV) <em>(NIV, BSB, NASB, NRSV, NABRE, NET, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>all people groups, including the Jews</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>all the nations (RSV) <em>(RSV, NJB, GNT, ESV, KJV, REB, NCV, GW, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because 1:6 has “in whom you<sup>(plur)</sup>” in the Greek, which seems to indicate only some of those in “To all those in Rome” (1:7).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Cranfield (page 67).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Gentiles:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Gentiles</em> refers to ethnic groups or people groups rather than to political states or countries.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>An ethnic group is a group of people who consider themselves a group because they share the same physical appearance, language, religion, culture, and history, or because they share two or more of these things. In modern times it is very common for borders of countries to pass directly through an area where an ethnic group lives, so that the ethnic group (in the way that Luke was using the Greek word) lives in two “nations” (using the sense of the word as used today).</span></span> Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>tribes</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>peoples</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>peoples of one language/culture</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the obedience that comes from faith:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the obedience that comes from faith</em> is literally “the obedience of faith.” There are three main ways to interpret the words “the obedience of faith” here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It indicates that faith is a <u>basis</u><span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In this TN, “basis” refers to the situation out of which something arises. It is sometimes called “grounds.” It does not indicate direct cause, as a reason-result relationship between clauses does.</span></span> for the obedience. Faith produces obedience.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Wallace (pages 104–106) for his category of “Genitive of Production/Producer.”</span></span> People obey because they believe. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the obedience that comes from faith (NIV) <em>(NIV, BSB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It indicates that a person obeys <u>all the teachings connected to</u> faith. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>obedience to the faith (KJV) <em>(KJV, JBP)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>and faith</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>believe and obey (GNT) <em>(GNT, NLT, CEV, REB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The RSV, the NJB, and a number of English versions translate the Greek as “the obedience of faith.” Both the Greek and that English translation are ambiguous, possibly meaning either interpretation (1) or (2). A number of scholars say that Paul meant several things here.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kruse (page 52) says, “care must be taken not to assume that faith <em>consisting</em> in obedience can be separated from faith <em>expressing</em> itself in obedience.” Schreiner (page 35) says, “The two most likely options are…the obedience that springs from or flows from faith…or ‘the obedience that is faith.’…Paul may have intended both ideas, and this is the most likely solution.” Garlington (1991, PhD thesis, in Kruse, page 52) says that “faith’s obedience” or “believing obedience” are better translations of this phrase and preserve the intended ambiguity. Stott also supports two interpretations. Hanna and Witherington support interpretation (1).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">So if you can translate in a way that allows interpretation (1) or (2), you should do so. However, if you must make a choice, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Paul did not say “and” even though he could have. So, interpretation (3) is not likely. The Greek phrase uses “faith” not “the faith,” so interpretation (2) is less likely than interpretation (1).</span></span> Here are other ways to translate this phrase according to interpretation (1):</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the obedience produced by faith</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>obedience based on faith</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people obey <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ</span> because they believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the message about him</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>believing obedience</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>faith’s obedience</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>obedience:</strong> This word means “doing as told, directed, or asked.” In some languages a verb is required or more natural here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>obey <span data-bnType=\"implied\">him</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>follow <span data-bnType=\"implied\">him</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>faith:</strong> To have <em>faith</em> in a person refers to believing in him, who he is, and who he claims to be.</p><p data-indent=\"3\">In some languages a verb is required or more natural here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the gospel</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>believing it</p></blockquote><h4>1:5a–c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:5a–c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(reordered) so that people of all non-Jewish ethnic groups would believe </strong><span data-bnType=\"implied\"><strong>in him</strong></span><strong> and therefore obey </strong><span data-bnType=\"implied\"><strong>him</strong></span><strong> in order that his name would become great.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>(reordered) in order that people among all tribes not Jewish would obey <span data-bnType=\"implied\">him/Jesus</span> because they believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in him</span>.

It does not separate some people called “you” here from other people called “you” here. For the correct meaning in some languages, translators must avoid the word <em>who</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and you are called to belong to Jesus Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has called you to belong to Jesus Christ</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>those who are called:</strong> This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> called</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>called:</strong> Here the word <em>called</em> means “chosen to be given a special benefit or purpose.” God invited people in Rome to believe in Jesus and therefore belong to Jesus.

It also refers to an attitude of actively seeking the good of another. It is the love a parent feels for his/her child. It does not refer to sexual desire. Consider how to translate that meaning in your language. Your language may have a phrase or idiom for that meaning.

Here, as in 1:6, the word <em>called</em> means “chosen to be given a special benefit or purpose.” God has called all believers to be saints.

I do his work by means of my spirit for the good news about his Son.</p></li><li><p>For God is my witness. I do his work regarding the gospel of his Son with my life. God knows that what I say here is true:</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">The Greek of 1:9a begins with a word that is often translated as “for” (as in the ESV). This word introduces support for Paul saying that he thanked God for the believers in Rome. Some languages can omit this word and imply this connection, as the BSB does.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God…is my witness:</strong> This clause is an oath. Paul knew that God could confirm that Paul was praying often for the believers in Rome. It also encourages the believers in Rome to believe that Paul was praying often for them and not doubt what he said here. It also emphasizes that Paul was speaking the truth about praying for them. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God knows and can tell you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God has seen and can proclaim</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>whom I serve with my spirit in preaching the gospel of His Son:</strong> This clause further describes God. It does not separate this God from other gods. For the correct meaning in some languages, translators must avoid the word <em>whom</em>. Here is one way:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>I serve God with my spirit in the gospel of his Son</u>, and he is my witness</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause also interrupts what Paul wanted the Roman believers to know (in the Greek: “God is my witness…that without ceasing I mention you always in my prayers”). In some languages, it is more natural to have this clause in a different place. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>For <u>I serve God with my spirit in the gospel of his Son</u>, and he is my witness</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>9–10</sup>God is my witness that without ceasing I mention you always in my prayers. <u>I serve him with my spirit in the gospel of his Son</u>. I am asking…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I serve:</strong> Here this word refers to doing things that God wants people to do. For Paul, this word would include his work as an apostle and evangelist. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I do his will</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I do everything that he commands me to do</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This word does not refer to giving food to God here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>with my spirit:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>with my spirit</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It indicates that <u>Paul’s spirit was the means by which he served God</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in my spirit (NASB) <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV11, NJB, KJV, NASB, NET, NABRE, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to the <u>sincerity</u> of Paul’s service. Paul was saying that he served God completely or wholeheartedly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whom I serve with my whole heart (NIV) <em>(NIV, GNT, NLT, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because the Greek phrase “in…spirit” does not mean “sincere” anywhere else in the NT.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The BSB usually translates the Greek that means “not hypocritical” as “sincere.” Cranfield, Dunn, Jewett, Witherington, Kruse, Barrett, Lenski, Nicoll, Fitzmyer, and Moo support interpretation (1).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>my spirit:</strong> The word <em>spirit</em> refers to the part of a person that is not the physical part. It includes the thinking, attitudes, emotions, and desires of that person. In some languages <em>spirit</em> is only used after a person has died physically. If that is true in your language, use the word with the correct meaning here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>my insides</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>my life</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in preaching the gospel of His Son:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>in preaching the gospel of His Son</em> is literally “in the gospel of his Son.” It indicates that Paul’s service to God was in reference to sharing the good news about Jesus Christ. This included <em>preaching</em>, teaching, and doing miracles in the name of Jesus Christ. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>concerning the gospel of his Son</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in regard to the gospel of his Son</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The BSB supplies the phrase <em>in preaching</em>. This is not in the Greek. While that is part of Paul’s service, he did many other things in relation to the gospel. Here is a more general way to translate the idea:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in spreading the Good News about his Son</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>gospel:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>gospel</em> means “good news.” Here, it refers to the good news that God sent Jesus to rescue us from wrongdoing and reconcile us to God. See how you translated this word in 1:1.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>of:</strong> The word <em>of</em> here probably indicates that the gospel informs people about Jesus.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Moo (on TW) and Kruse (page 57).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>about (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>His Son:</strong> The phrase <em>His Son</em> refers to Jesus. He is God’s Son. It indicates that the relationship between God and Jesus is similar to the relationship of human fathers and their sons. See how you translated this phrase in 1:3.</p><h4>1:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>how constantly I remember you</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He is able to testify</span> that I speak a short talk/message/prayer to God about you continually</p></li><li><p>I am always speaking briefly to God about you</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>how constantly:</strong> This phrase is an exaggeration for emphasis. Here it means “continually” or “all the time.” It does not mean “every minute that Paul was awake.” Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>continually (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>never stop (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I remember you:</strong> This word indicates here that Paul referred to them when he to God. It also may indicate remembering to pray for them. Paul prayed briefly but often for the Roman believers.</p>",

Here the word “if” indicates that Paul was uncertain whether or not he would go to Rome. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if somehow<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Witherington, page 41, and Moo, page 55.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">These words also indicate that Paul was not sure how he would get to Rome.

Many languages can translate the more literal Greek for the correct meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He might make a way that<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Western Bukidnon Manobo Back Translation.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he will open give a/any way to me<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Nalik Back Translation, draft, Papua New Guinea.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I may be granted good passage<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Jewett, page 117.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Note that the first two examples above change the Greek passive to an active clause.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions follow the more figurative meaning of this Greek word: “to succeed,” as the BSB does.

Tob 5:16), so ‘prosper, succeed’ (cf. 2 Chron 32:30; Sir 41:1; 1 Cor 16:2); but in view of the context Paul may have the original meaning in mind (Lightfoot)—cf. 1 Thess 3:11.”</span></span></p>",

He told them that he had been wanting to visit them for a long time and was eager to preach the gospel to the people there.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Then Paul wrote down the main things he wanted to talk about in the rest of the letter.

In 1:11 Paul explained why he was praying to visit the believers in Rome. Some languages may omit this word for a more natural connection.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I long to see you:</strong> The word <em>long</em> means “want very much” here. The Greek word is present tense, indicating that Paul was continuing to want very much to see the believers in Rome. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am wanting very much to see you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I really/truly want to see you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages “want” already indicates continuing to do that, as in the above example.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>see:</strong> Here this word implies visiting with the believers in Rome.

It does not indicate a plural: gifts. In some languages another word must be used. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a/another</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>spiritual gift:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>gift</em> here refers to something that is given generously, without cost to the person receiving it. Calling it a <em>spiritual gift</em> indicates that the gift was not a physical thing (like a chair or table). This <em>gift</em> benefited the believers in their “spirit” (or inner being). Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>spiritual blessing (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>something to encourage/bless you in your inner being</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>something to strengthen/benefit your insides/heart</p></blockquote><h4>1:11c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:11c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to strengthen you,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I want that that gift</span> will make you stronger <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in faith</span>,</p></li><li><p>In that way <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> may make you stand strong even more <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in your believing</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to strengthen you:</strong> This phrase indicates that Paul wanted the spiritual gift to make the believers in Rome more strong or firm in their faith.

It probably implies that the thing that Paul and the believers in Corinth shared would strengthen them, not that they would strengthen themselves. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">it</span> may strengthen <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you and me</span></p></blockquote>",

In some languages, it is more natural to have the address first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Brothers and sisters, I want you to know (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I do not want you to be unaware:</strong> The Greek clause here is literally “I do not want you to be ignorant.” It emphasizes what he was about to say.

The word indicates a close relationship because all believers are considered spiritual children of God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>my fellow believers</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages <em>brothers</em> would be understood as literal brothers.

Here Paul implied that either God or Paul’s work among the churches that he started or something else has prevented him from going to Rome. Some languages must use a non-passive clause here.

It refers to there being results of his ministry in Rome. There are a number of possible results that Paul could have been thinking of,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example, the GNT says “I want to win converts among you also.” The NCV says, “I could help you grow spiritually.” Jewett (page 130) says, “Paul hopes to gain logistical and tactical support from Rome for his mission to Spain.”</span></span> so your translation should indicate that Paul wanted something to occur that would build God’s kingdom but does not say what possibilities he had in mind.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages must translate without part or all of the metaphor for the correct meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I might work as fruitfully among you (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I want to work among you and see spiritual fruit (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>have some of the results of working among you</p></blockquote><h4>1:13e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>just as I have had among the other Gentiles.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>just as I have harvested fruit in other non-Jewish places.</p></li><li><p>like I saw results <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for the gospel</span> among the other non-Jews <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in other cities</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>just as I have had among the other Gentiles:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>just as</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It indicates that Paul <u>compared</u> his hope for a harvest in Rome to what he had already done among <em>Gentiles</em> in other places. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as I have among other Gentiles (GNT) <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, KJV, NRSV, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, REB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It indicates that Paul wanted to <u>add</u> to the harvest at Rome with a harvest among <em>Gentiles</em> elsewhere. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as well as among the rest of the Gentiles (RSV) <em>(RSV, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because that is the usual meaning of the Greek word.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>All scholars this author consulted support interpretation (1). The BDAG (page 493–494) does not even list a meaning of “as well as” for this word.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I have had:</strong> The BSB adds these words, but they are clearly implied from the rest of the sentence. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I have (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>among the other Gentiles:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>the other</em> indicates that Paul thought of the group of believers at Rome were mostly Gentiles, and Paul had preached among other Gentiles and some believed in Jesus. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>among the rest of the Gentiles (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>among other Gentiles (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word probably implies all other Gentiles. Paul had not gone to all other Gentiles, but used this as a figure of speech to imply that he visited many Gentiles. The GNT example above avoids the exaggeration in English. You should avoid indicating or implying “all” other Gentiles.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Gentiles:</strong> The word <em>Gentiles</em> refers to non-Jewish people. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:13a–e</strong></h5><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use a descriptive phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>non-Jews</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those who were not Jewish</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a word or phrase from another language that is well known to the people in your language. If you choose this option, you may want to add a footnote. Here is an example footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Jews considered all other people and nations to be outside of God’s plan to save them. The word used here describes all people who were not Jews.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">The words “but have been prevented from visiting” (1:13c) interrupt the words “how often I planned to come to you…in order that I might have a harvest among you” (1:13b,d). The BSB indicates that by putting parentheses around the words. In some languages it is more natural to have the words of 1:13c either before or after the words of 1:13b,d. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>13a</sup>I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that <sup>13c</sup><u>I have been prevented from visiting, but</u> <sup>13b</sup>I often planned to come to you <sup>13d</sup>in order that I may have a harvest among you <sup>13e</sup>as well as among the rest of the Gentiles.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>13a</sup>I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, <sup>13b</sup>that I often planned to come to you <sup>13d</sup>in order that I may have a harvest among you <sup>13e</sup>as well as among the rest of the Gentiles, <sup>13c</sup><u>but have been prevented from visiting</u>.</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:13a–e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13a–e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(reordered) </strong><span data-bnType=\"implied\"><strong>My</strong></span><strong> brothers </strong><span data-bnType=\"implied\"><strong>and sisters</strong></span><strong>, I do not want you to be ignorant that again and again I planned to come to visit you.

In some languages, it may be more natural to omit this word and leave the connection with 1:15 implicit, as the BSB does.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I am not ashamed of the gospel:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is a textual issue in 1:16a: (1) Some Greek manuscripts have the word <u>gospel</u> (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NABRE, GW, CEV, NET, REB, ESV, NCV). (2) Some Greek manuscripts have the words <u>gospel of Christ</u> (KJV, NLT). It is recommended that you follow option (1). The NLT probably adds “about Christ” to make it clear who the gospel is about, as it normally does not follow the Byzantine text like the KJV does. The people who added “of Christ” long ago probably did it to make it clear who the gospel was about.</span></span> The gospel is about a poor Jewish itinerant preacher who was crucified on a Roman cross. Some Romans would be ashamed to follow such a leader. But Paul was not <em>ashamed</em> of him or the message he preached, the gospel.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some scholars and English versions see “not ashamed” as a figure of speech (litotes) meaning “proud.” But Cranfield (page 86) and Jewett (page 137) say it is not litotes here.</span></span> Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I do not have shame about the gospel</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am not ashamed of the good news <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of/about Jesus</span></p></blockquote><h4>1:16b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:16b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because it is God’s power to save all people who believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in him/Jesus</span>.</p></li><li><p>For the/that good message has God’s power so that he rescues everyone who believes <span data-bnType=\"implied\">it</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from the penalty of sin/wrongdoing</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because:</strong> Here this word introduces the reason for Paul saying that he was not ashamed of the gospel. Some languages have the word “therefore” and not the word <em>because</em>. If that is true in your language, reorder 1:16b–c and 1:16a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For <sup>16b</sup>the gospel is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, <sup>16c</sup>to the Jew first and also to the Greek, and therefore <sup>16a</sup>I am not ashamed of it.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it is the power of God for salvation:</strong> Here the word <em>it</em> refers to the gospel. This clause indicates that the gospel is the power that God uses to save people. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it is the power of God that brings salvation (NIV11)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it is God’s power to save (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>salvation:</strong> This word refers to being rescued from something harmful or dangerous. In Scripture it generally refers to rescue from God’s anger at the final judgment. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to save (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>their lives will be saved<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is necessary to say what people are saved from.

He will save all people who believe the gospel about Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>believes:</strong> To “believe” in someone means to agree to what someone stands for, to trust him, to rely on him, to be committed to him. See how your translated the word “faith” in 1:5.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is necessary to say what these people believe in. If that is true in your language, refer to Jesus or his gospel. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>believes it (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>believes <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Jesus</span></p></blockquote><h4>1:16c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:16c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>first to the Jew, then to the Greek.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This Good News went</span> first for the Jew, then for the Greek.</p></li><li><p>We Jews were the first to hear that message, and now you non-Jews also hear that message.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>first to the Jew, then to the Greek:</strong> The word <em>first</em> indicates that God gave his message of salvation to the Jews first, then he gave it to the Greeks. It may also indicate that the Jews had higher status in God’s sight because he chose them to be his people. Here are other ways to translate these words:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>first to the Jew, then to the Greek</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jews first, but Greeks as well (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It was made known first to the Jews, after that to the Gentiles.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey Back Translation on TW.</span></span> Some languages can imply both first in time and first in status, as the Greek word does. But many languages must choose one meaning or the other. If that is true in your language, translate it as <em>first</em> in time.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Jew…the Greek:</strong> The words <em>Jew</em> and <em>Greek</em> are singular, but they refer generally to any Jew or Greek. In some languages it is more natural to use plurals, as the NJB does above.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the Greek:</strong> The word <em>Greek</em> refers to all non-Jews here. Non-Jews generally did not like the term “Gentile,” because it implied that the Jews thought that they were better than the Gentiles. So Paul probably used the word <em>Greek</em> here to avoid bad feelings on the part of the non-Jews.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer only to people from the country of Greece. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. Here is an example footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Here the word “Greek” refers to all non-Jews.

In some languages it may not be clear what “it” refers to here. If that is true in your language, use your normal word or phrase for <em>the gospel</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in/through the gospel</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>reveals the righteousness of God:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>reveals</em> is passive. The whole verse part is more literally “For the righteousness of God is revealed in it.” It is likely that God (or the Holy Spirit) reveals here. The present tense indicates an ongoing action. Some languages must use an active clause here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God is revealing his righteousness</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the righteousness of God:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>righteousness</em> refers to doing what is right here. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s righteousness</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the right/straight living/deeds of God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The scholars understand this phrase in several different ways here, including “God calling someone righteous” and “God’s “righteous activity.” But the above definition seems best here, since the gospel reveals it.</p><h4>1:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that comes by faith from start to finish,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">someone’s</span> faith to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">another’s</span> faith,</p></li><li><p>from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">their</span> faith/believing to the faith/believing <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of those who hear and so believe</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by faith from start to finish:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>by faith from start to finish</em> is literally “from faith to faith.” The expression indicates that revealing God’s righteousness is connected to or requires faith. The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>by</em> can also mean “to” or “for.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>from faith to faith (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages can translate these words literally. Scholars understand them in many different ways here. Here are some of the interpretations:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “from God’s faithfulness to believers’ faith.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Dunn (pages 43–44), Longenecker (pages 178–179), and Witherington (page 55).</span></span></p></li><li><p>It refers to a progression, from person to person as the gospel is shared and new people believe it.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Jewett (page 143) supports this interpretation. He refers to similar use of “from…to…” in Psalms 83:8, Jeremiah 9:2, 2 Corinthians 2:16, and 3:18. He calls it “the missionary expansion of the gospel.”</span></span></p></li><li><p>It refers to a progression within a person’s faith.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Schreiner (page 72–73).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a righteousness that is <u>by faith from first to last</u> (NIV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is an <u>idiom</u> that means “by faith alone.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Cranfield (page 99–100).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God accepts everyone who has <u>faith, but only those who have faith</u> (CEV)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek seems to allow interpretation (1) or (2), and, less likely, (3) or (4).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Witherington (page 55) says, “The notion that this is simply an intensified way of saying ‘by faith’ or ‘by faith alone’…entirely ignores the usual force of the preposition <em>ek</em> (‘from’).”</span></span> Scholars of one interpretation argue against other interpretations, but no one argument seems to stand out as clearly best. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) or (2). But if the major language version follows interpretation (3) or (4), you may want to follow that.</p><h4>1:17c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:17c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>just as it is written: “The righteous will live by faith.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>as it was written long ago, “The righteous person will live according to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his</span> faith.”</p></li><li><p>It is just as the Scriptures say, “Righteous people will live following/obeying <span data-bnType=\"implied\">their</span> faith.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">The quote here is from Habakkuk 2:4. If you indicate the location of quotes from the Old Testament with cross-references, you may want to do so here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>just as:</strong> Here this word indicates a comparison between “the righteousness of God that comes by faith from start to finish” (1:17a–b) and “The righteous will live by faith” (1:17c).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it is written:</strong> The Greek is more literally “it has been written.” Habakkuk wrote more than 600 years before Paul wrote the letter to the Romans. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate the quote was written at the same time as Paul wrote here. If that is true in your language, indicate it was long before Paul wrote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it was written <span data-bnType=\"implied\">long ago</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause refers to what was written in the Old Testament. Some languages must make that explicit to make that clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>As the scripture says (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The clause is passive. The prophet Habakkuk wrote what God told him to write. Some languages must use a clause that is not passive here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the prophet wrote <span data-bnType=\"implied\">long ago</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>what God caused-to-be-written which says,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It is like it says in the Holy Book<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The righteous will live by faith:</strong> This quote is from Habakkuk 2:4. If you indicate the location of quotes from the Old Testament with cross-references, you may want to do so here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek is literally “a righteous-one from faith will live.” There are several ways to interpret how “from faith” connects to the rest of the clause. Here are the two main ones:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It connects to <u>shall<em>/will live</em></u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The righteous will live by faith (BSB) <em>(BSB, NIV, NRSV, NASB, KJV, ESV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It connects to <u><em>the righteous</em></u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He who through faith is righteous shall live (RSV) <em>(RSV, GNT, CEV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because it is a common way to connect such a phrase to the verb.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Jewett (page 146). Also, it is closer to the Hebrew in Habakkuk 2:4 (Lenski, page 71).</span></span> But interpretation (2) is also possible, so if the major language version follows that, you may want to follow it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions try to copy the perceived ambiguity in the Greek. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The one who is righteous by faith will live (NABRE)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>The righteous:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>righteous</em> here refers to people who do what is right. It implies doing what God says is right to do. It does not refer to people who think they are righteous according to their own power or thinking. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Righteous people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>People who do what is right</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This has a similar meaning to “righteousness” in 1:17a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>by faith:</strong> The word <em>by</em> indicates that righteous people live by means of their faith.

It does not separate some people from other people. Translate this clause so that it tells more about all people. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They suppress the truth by their wickedness.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>suppress the truth:</strong> Here the word <em>suppress</em> refers to preventing others from knowing <em>the truth</em>.

Some languages only have an adjective meaning “true” and so must add a noun. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the true <span data-bnType=\"implied\">talk</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>their wickedness:</strong> People’s unrighteous deeds is the way that they suppress the truth.

If that is true in your language, translate naturally. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>their hearts are foolish</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they <u>are foolish and</u> their hearts were darkened</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>foolish:</strong> The Greek word here refers to not being able to understand things well.

In some languages, another body part is used to describe this. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>liver</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>stomach</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>throat</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If a literal translation of <em>hearts</em> (or another body part) would not refer to the inner person, you should translate the meaning directly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>insides</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>minds</p></blockquote>",

For the correct meaning in some languages, translators must avoid the word <em>who</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He is blessed forever.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>is forever worthy of praise:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>worthy of praise</em> here means “blessed” or “honored.” People and the angels and other creatures of heaven are praising and will always praise and honor God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>worthy of praise</em> describes God. Some languages must use a verb instead.

It refers generally to those women, not implying all of them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>natural relations:</strong> This phrase here refers to a man and a woman having sex.

(Here the word <em>indecent</em> indicates that these men should have been ashamed, but they were not.) Here it refers specifically to men having sex with other men. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>doing shameful things (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>behave indecently (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the filthy-things they have been doing<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek tense indicates that they continued to do these things at that time.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>in their own persons (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the due penalty:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>due</em> indicates that the penalty <u>needs to</u> be given. It is not maybe or perhaps. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the necessary punishment</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the punishment that God has chosen for those deeds</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>error:</strong> The Greek word here means “wandering” and here implies wandering from the path of truth.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDAG (page 822).</span></span> It can refer to both wrong behavior and wrong thinking.

And so God put them under the control of sinful desires even more.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The reason why God is angry with people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s Wrath on Unrighteousness (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>People do what is not right in God’s sight and so God is angry</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:29a–31</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In this list of evil deeds, the Greek does not have a connecting word between each item. The BSB copies what the Greek does here. In some languages it is more natural to have an “and” between each item. Use the most natural way of connecting items in a list in your translation.</p><h4>1:29a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>every kind of wickedness, evil, greed, and depravity:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is a textual issue regarding the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>evil</em> in 1:29b: (1) Some Greek manuscripts have the word <u>evil</u> (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2) Some Greek manuscripts have the words <u>immorality, evil</u> (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1).</span></span> The phrase <em>every kind of</em> applies to all four words: <em>wickedness, evil, greed, and depravity</em>. Make that clear in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>all manner of these things: unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, and malice</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>all kinds of unrighteousness and all kinds of evil and all kinds of covetousness and all kinds of malice</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>wickedness:</strong> This word refers to deeds that are not right to do. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>deeds that are not upright/straight</p></blockquote><h4>1:29a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:29a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>They have become filled with every kind of wickedness,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They are full of all kinds of deeds that are not upright,</p></li><li><p>At every opportunity they do what is not right,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>They have become filled with:</strong> The Greek tense indicates that earlier these people became full of the bad deeds listed below and at that time were still full of them. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They are full of</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Their lives became full of (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages using a past tense indicates that it is no longer true in the present. Translate in a way that indicates that they were still doing these things at that time.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>have become filled with:</strong> This is a figurative way of saying that a person thinks of something often or all the time. Some languages cannot use <em>have become filled</em> when referring to sins. Here are other ways to translate this meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They continually are thinking of</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>All of…arose in their insides<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Yongkom Back Translation by this author, unpublished manuscript.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>These kinds of bad thoughts are very much among them <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all the time</span>:</p></blockquote><h4>1:29b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:29b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>evil, greed, and depravity.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">as well as full of</span> wicked deeds, greed, and hate.</p></li><li><p>and do very bad things <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to other people</span>, and are always wanting more and more, and hurt <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other people</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>evil:</strong> The Greek word refers to a person having no moral values. Anything is okay to think or do if he wants to. Satan is called “the evil one” (Matthew 5:37, John 17:15, Ephesians 6:16, and other verses). He is the best example of this way of thinking. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>wickedness (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>sinfulness</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>greed:</strong> This word refers to always wanting to have more. It often implies more than that person needs or more than other people. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>covetousness (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>grab-after what is not theirs<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They want to increasingly multiply what they own<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>depravity:</strong> This word refers to wanting to do things that hurt other people or hurting them on purpose when doing bad things to them. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>hate (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the desire to hurt others</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They are mean (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>1:29c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:29c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>They are full of envy, murder,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They are full of resentment, murder/killing,</p></li><li><p>And they are also always jealous <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of other people</span> and kill <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>They are full of envy:</strong> The BSB adds the words <em>They are</em>. In Greek the list just continues but repeats the idea of <em>full of</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>full of envy (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to add “also” when repeating the idea <em>full of</em> here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They are also full of envy</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and also full of envy</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>envy:</strong> This word refers to being upset with someone because that person is in a better situation than him in some way. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>jealous of their companions<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Yakan Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>resentment</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They want what others have (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The word here does not refer to sexual jealousy (for example, a husband upset with his wife because she talked to another man and he is worried about her liking the other man more than him).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>murder:</strong> This word refers to killing another person. It usually implies killing someone on purpose and against the law.</p><h4>1:29d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:29d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>strife, deceit, and malice.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>quarreling/arguing, cheating <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">out of their things</span>, and have a lifestyle/attitude of hate.</p></li><li><p>And they fight, and trick <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">out of their things</span>, and are always trying to hurt <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other people</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>strife:</strong> This word refers to conflict of any kind: arguments, fighting over a difference of opinion, or rivalry over a job or position. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>fighting (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>arguing</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>rivalry (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>deceit:</strong> The Greek word here refers to misleading people in order to gain some benefit or advantage.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDAG (page 256).</span></span> Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>cheat (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>defraud people of their things</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>tricksters<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>malice:</strong> This word refers to an attitude of wanting to hurt other people. It is similar to the Greek word that the BSB translates as “depravity” in 1:29b, but the word here refers to an ongoing attitude. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>always hateful</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the attitude of hurting others</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>being habitually mean</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages one word or phrase covers both “depravity” and <em>malice</em>. If that is true in your language, use only that one word or phrase in this verse.</p><h4>1:29e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:29e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>They are gossips,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They whisper about others,</p></li><li><p>And they say/report bad things about others</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>They are gossips:</strong> The BSB adds the words <em>They are</em> here. The Greek changes case<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>from genitive, to connect to “full,” to accusative.</span></span> to indicate that the next twelve items are not grouped with “full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice,” but in a separate group. Paul was still describing these people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>deceit, malignity, <u>they are gossips</u>, (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They gossip (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and they also gossip</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>gossips:</strong> The Greek word here is literally “whisperers.” It refers to a person who, quietly, in the ear of someone else, says bad things about others and passes on information or rumors about them that are hurtful. Here are other ways to translate this Greek word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>whisperers-behind-doors (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>talk-behind-the-back<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote>",

He used the singular “you” throughout the chapter. This form of teaching is called a “diatribe.” Only one person is talking (or writing), but it is as if two people are talking back and forth, asking and answering questions, making objections and responding. Using this diatribe, Paul rebuked those who judged others improperly. The person whom Paul spoke to here was not a believer. His evil deeds store up God’s wrath against him (2:5), and his sins will cause him to perish (2:12).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In this section, Paul addressed someone who judged others as bad but did the same things (2:1). God would punish such a person (2:2–3); it is according to what a person has done (2:6–11) and according to the knowledge of God that a person has (2:12–15).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The person who does not believe and judges other people as bad yet does the same things</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Hypocritical people who do not believe in Jesus</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on another.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Therefore, O man/person, every one of you<sup>(plur)</sup> who judges, you cannot defend doing that.</p></li><li><p>¶ But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">many of</span> you<sup>(plur)</sup> condemn other people when they do wrong. But not one of you can tell God one good reason for that behavior.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul later described this person, whom he addresses as “O man,” as someone who did not believe in Jesus. This person’s evil deeds stored up God’s wrath against him (2:5), and his sins would cause him to perish (2:12). He was of the same group as the group Paul described in 1:18–32, people who do not believe in Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse starts a new chapter. Readers may not see that this person was not a believer. You may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Make the section heading clearly refer to a person who does not believe. See the current suggested section heading and the suggested alternatives.</p></li><li><p>Add a footnote on “you” or “O man” to explain. Here is an example footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul spoke to a person who did not believe in Jesus here. This person was an example of this kind of hypocrite.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on another:</strong> The pronoun <em>You</em> is singular. See description above in Section 2:1–16. Paul did not have just one person in mind here, because many people were doing this. Consider how to make that clear in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a footnote to explain would be helpful to the readers. Here is an example footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Paul now wrote about people who judge others as bad people yet do the same bad things.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>You, therefore, have no excuse:</strong> The Greek phrase is more literally “Therefore, you have no excuse, O man.” The term of address (“O man”) is not at the beginning of the sentence. In some languages it is more natural to have the term of address first, as in the BSB. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>O man, you therefore have no excuse</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>You:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>You</em> is literally “O man” (ESV). The word Paul uses is not excluding women from what he said here. In some languages it is more natural to use a word or phrase that includes women. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>O person</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>my friend (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>therefore:</strong> This conjunction introduces a conclusion from what Paul wrote in 1:18–32. God is angry with the evil that people do (1:18), so now Paul wrote that God is also angry with people who judge other people unfairly (2:1).</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>have no excuse:</strong> The word <em>excuse</em> refers to an explanation of behavior when asked about that behavior. In this case, it indicates that the judging person might give reasons why he thinks it is right to judge others in this way. But Paul knew that this person had no good reason for his judging attitude. His judging in this way was still wrong. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>you have no defence (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>you have no answer <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for this</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>you have nothing with-which-to-answer God<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated the word <em>excuse</em> in 1:20.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>pass judgment:</strong> This word refers to looking at someone’s behavior and deciding whether it is good or bad and whether the person deserves to be punished for it. The people that Paul wrote to here think of themselves as the judge of others’ actions, with the right to decide about their guilt. But they had no authority to do that. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>says is guilty</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>accuse others of doing wrong (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>criticizes</p></blockquote><h4>2:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For on whatever grounds you judge the other, you are condemning yourself,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For in what you<sup>(sing)</sup> judge the other person, you declare/show that someone should punish you,</p></li><li><p>Look, God will judge you worthy of punishment on the same basis you judge others guilty,</p></li><li><p>Because whenever you<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">look at what somebody else has done and</span> say, “That person has done wrong and God should punish him,” it shows/indicates that it is right for God to punish you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> This conjunction introduces the reason why the judging people had no excuse. Here is another way to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions omit this conjunction (perhaps because of another “because” in 2:1c) and allow the context to indicate the connection.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>on whatever grounds you judge the other, you are condemning yourself:</strong> The Greek is literally “in what you judge the other, you condemn yourself.” These people did the same things (2:1c) that they condemn in others, so they condemn themselves in that way. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When you judge them, you are really judging yourself guilty (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When you say they are wicked and should be punished, you are condemning yourself (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>are condemning yourself:</strong> The word <em>condemning</em> usually indicates that a judge has decided how to punish the guilty person. Here it indicates that these people, by judging others, have indicated that they themselves are worthy of punishment. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>say that you yourself should be punished</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>declare yourself worthy to be punished</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>proclaim that someone should punish you</p></blockquote><h4>2:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because you who pass judgment do the same things.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because you, a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so-called</span> judge, do exactly the same deeds.</p></li><li><p>for you, as <span data-bnType=\"implied\">self-appointed</span> judge, do the same deeds <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that you judge as wrong in others</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Why is that/this?</span> It is because you, who are behaving like a judge, are doing the same <span data-bnType=\"implied\">bad</span> things <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as that person</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because you who pass judgment do the same things:</strong> The phrase <em>you who pass judgment</em> again describes the person that Paul addressed as <em>you</em>. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you who judge practice the same things (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you, as judge, do the same deeds</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions omit the phrase <em>pass judgment</em> because that meaning is already present in this verse and it makes 2:1c easier to read. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you are guilty of doing the very same things (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you do the same things they do (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>who pass judgment:</strong> The Greek words here are “the one judging.” The words indicate that these people often judge others. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>judging one</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who judge (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who judge <span data-bnType=\"implied\">others</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as bad</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>do:</strong> Here the Greek word refers to doing something. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>practice (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>are doing</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 1:32.</p>",

His evil deeds store up God’s wrath against him (2:5), and his sins will cause him to perish (2:12).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In this section, Paul addressed someone who judged others as bad but did the same things (2:1). God would punish such a person (2:2–3); it is according to what a person has done (2:6–11) and according to the knowledge of God that a person has (2:12–15).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The person who does not believe and judges other people as bad yet does the same things</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Hypocritical people who do not believe in Jesus</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:4a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Or do you disregard the riches of His kindness, tolerance, and patience, not realizing that God’s kindness leads you to repentance?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. It emphasizes that this man should not expect God to be kind, forbearing, and patient with him if he continued to sin in that way. Translate this with that meaning. Here are some ways:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>are you not disregarding his abundant goodness, tolerance and patience, failing to realise that this generosity of God is meant to bring you to repentance? (NJB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are wrong to disregard the riches of his kindness, tolerance, and patience, and you should know that God’s kindness leads you to repentance.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a command. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>do not disregard the riches of his kindness, tolerance, and patience. Know that God’s kindness leads you to repentance.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">You should probably use the same kind of sentence (rhetorical question, statement, or command) as in 2:3.</p><h4>2:4a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:4a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Or do you disregard the riches of His kindness, tolerance, and patience,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Or, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">another question is:</span> do you<sup>(sing)</sup> scorn the riches of his kind deeds to you, tolerance, and patient waiting <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for you</span>,</p></li><li><p>God has been very good to you. He tolerates your misdeeds. And he waits for you to do what is right. You are wrong to despise him for doing that.</p></li><li><p>Do not think of God’s great kindness and patience as worthless/nothing.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Or:</strong> In this context the word <em>Or</em> indicates that Paul asked a second rhetorical question related to the first rhetorical question (2:3). Both rhetorical questions are rebukes against wrong thinking. Consider how to indicate that meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>disregard:</strong> Here this phrase refers to despising something. This man should not think of God’s kindness, tolerance, and patience as worthless. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>have contempt for (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>despise (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>think nothing of (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the riches of His kindness, tolerance, and patience:</strong> Paul used the word <em>riches</em> figuratively here to indicate that God has <u>much</u> <em>kindness, tolerance, and patience</em>. Some languages cannot use the word <em>riches</em> figuratively here. If that is true in your language, translate the figurative meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his <u>great</u> kindness, tolerance, and patience (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his <u>abundant</u> goodness, tolerance and patience (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>kindness:</strong> This word refers to doing good to someone because you want to. God does many good things for people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>tolerance:</strong> This word refers to waiting to punish someone, to give him time to stop doing bad deeds. God has delayed punishing people when they have deserved it, allowing them the opportunity to repent. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>forbearance (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>waiting to judge <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as guilty</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>patience:</strong> This word also refers to waiting for a person to either stop doing bad or to do something good. God is often endures people’s bad deeds waiting for them to do good deeds. You may have an idiom that translates this meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This word is similar in meaning to “tolerance” above. See the General Comment below.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:4a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The words “tolerance” and “patience” are very similar in meaning. In some languages it is more natural to translate using one word or phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>patient (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God is waiting for the person to separate from evil<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote></div><h4>2:4b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:4b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>not realizing that God’s kindness leads you to repentance?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>not realizing that the kind deeds of God lead you to repent?</p></li><li><p>You are wrong to ignore <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the fact</span> that whenever God does good to you, he wants you to turn away from your misdeeds.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">And</span> do not ignore God calling you to leave your wrongdoing when he does kind deeds to you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not realizing that God’s kindness leads you to repentance:</strong> This clause is a part of the rhetorical question. It implies that the man <u>should</u> know that <em>God’s kindness</em> leads <em>to repentance</em> but has ignored this fact. Here are some ways to indicate this implied information:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Make this clause a separate rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do you not realize that God’s kindness is meant to lead you to repentance? (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Can’t you see that his kindness is intended to turn you from your sin?

He used the singular “you” throughout the chapter. This form of teaching is called a “diatribe.” Only one person is talking (or writing), but it is as if two people are talking back and forth, asking and answering questions, making objections and responding. Using this diatribe, Paul rebuked those who judged others improperly. The person whom Paul spoke to here was not a believer. His evil deeds store up God’s wrath against him (2:5), and his sins will cause him to perish (2:12).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In this section, Paul addressed someone who judged others as bad but did the same things (2:1).

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who do not obey the true words <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of God</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>follow wickedness:</strong> This is the opposite of obeying the truth. These people do what they know God would want them not to do. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>follow what is wrong (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>live lives of wickedness (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>obey unrighteousness (ESV)</p></blockquote><h4>2:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>there will be wrath and anger.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God will be</span> very angry with them.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God will give to them</span> punishment full of his fury/anger.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>there will be wrath and anger:</strong> The BSB supplies the words <em>there will be</em>. The context implies “he will give” from 2:7c. It indicates that God will have <em>wrath and anger</em> toward this second group of people.

They probably have similar meanings here. Together they would indicate a great amount of anger.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages have only one word for the meaning of “anger.” If that is true in your language, indicate a great amount of anger. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>great anger</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some scholars think this phrase is a figure of speech where one term describes the other even though they are connected with <em>and</em>.

It is their deeds that show that the principles of God’s law are in their hearts. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Their conduct (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>show:</strong> The present tense here indicates that Gentiles show this throughout their lives.

Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> wrote the work of the law on their hearts</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the work of the law:</strong> This phrase refers to doing good deeds and avoiding bad deeds, following the principles of God’s law. Examples are: “honor your father and mother” (Exodus 20:12) and “do not murder” (Exodus 20:13). Gentiles did not have the exact words of the Old Testament but they behaved in similar ways.

It means “exists in.” The Gentiles often behave as if they already know how God wants them to behave. In some languages a literal translation would not be natural. If that is true in your language, translate without the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>is in their hearts</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they know</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>their hearts:</strong> Here the word <em>hearts</em> refers figuratively to the inner being, which includes the mind, the emotions, and the will. In some languages a literal translation would not refer to the inner being. If that is true in your language, you may want to use the word or phrase that has the right meaning.

God would punish such a person (2:2–3); it is according to what a person has done (2:6–11) and according to the knowledge of God that a person has (2:12–15).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The person who does not believe and judges other people as bad yet does the same things</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Hypocritical people who do not believe in Jesus</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:16a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:16a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>on the day when God will judge men’s secrets through Christ Jesus,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">And</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">this will also be true</span> on the day when God judges the secret deeds and thoughts of people through Jesus, the Christ/Messiah,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">And</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they will do that</span> at the time when God will authorize Jesus, the one/person whom God appointed to save/rescue <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span>, and he/Jesus will judge the things that people have done secretly,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>on the day:</strong> Paul now talked about God’s final judgment day. At that time people’s thoughts will also accuse them of wrongdoing and sometimes defend them of doing right. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And so,…this is how it will be on that Day (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the day is coming (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So it will be on the day (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>when God will judge men’s secrets through Christ Jesus:</strong> There is a textual issue here about the order of the words <em>Christ Jesus</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The order of the words are <u>Christ Jesus</u>. This emphasizes that Jesus is the Christ. <em>(BSB, RSV, ESV, NASB, NABRE, NLT, GW, NET, REB, NCV)</em></p></li><li><p>The order of the words are <u>Jesus Christ</u>. This indicates that Jesus is the Christ but does not emphasize that fact. <em>(NIV, GNT, NJB, CEV, KJV)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1), because the scholars of the UBS Greek NT believe it to be the correct text.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>They indicate that they had difficulty in deciding which was the correct text.

If that is true in your language, emphasize the fact that Jesus is the Christ in a natural way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God judges the secrets of men by Jesus, who/he is the Christ</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>God will judge:</strong> This phrase refers to a future event. Several English translations use the present tense here. Despite this, in some languages the future tense is more natural. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God…will judge (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>men’s:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>men’s</em> is a general word that includes both men and women. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>of all (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>secrets:</strong> Here, this word refers to deeds that no one saw and words that no one else heard as well as thoughts.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>through Christ Jesus:</strong> This phrase indicates that God gave authority to Jesus to judge everyone. Jesus will judge everyone. Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>by Christ Jesus (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Christ:</strong> The word <em>Christ</em> is a title for Jesus. It means “the anointed one.” The Jews used it to refer to the special person God promised to send.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that the <em>gospel</em> was about Paul. If that is true in your language, indicate that the <em>gospel</em> is about Jesus.

(2) Some Greek manuscripts have the word <u>look</u> (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1).</span></span> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Now</em> introduces a new part of Paul’s talk about the Jews. There is some contrast here with what he said about the Gentiles. Here is another way to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if:</strong> Paul used <em>if</em> here to cause the Roman believers to evaluate their own lives and determine if these verses apply to them. He probably expects some of them to say that they are like what he said here. Consider how to translate that meaning for the word <em>if</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the Greek text, this one <em>if</em> affects all of 2:17a–20c. (The word “then” does not occur until 2:21a.) Consider how to include all of 2:17a–20c in the <em>if</em> clause in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages may need to repeat the word <em>if</em> to make this clear. The BSB repeats it once in 2:18 and again in 2:19. But in some languages it is more natural to repeat it more often. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>17</sup>Now if you call yourself a Jew and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">if you</span> rely on the law and boast in God <sup>18</sup>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">if you</span> know his will and approve what is superior, because you are instructed from the law; <sup>19</sup>and <u>if you</u> are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those in darkness, <sup>20</sup>an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>17</sup>Now if you call yourself a Jew and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">if you</span> rely on the law and boast in God <sup>18</sup>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">if you</span> know his will and approve what is superior, because you are instructed from the law; <sup>19</sup>and <u>if you</u> are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those in darkness, <sup>20</sup>an instructor of the foolish, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and</span> a teacher of infants, because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you are convinced that</span> you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth,</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural not to repeat the word <em>if</em> at all, including 2:19a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>17</sup>But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God <sup>18</sup>and know his will and approve what is superior, because you are instructed from the law; <sup>19</sup>and are sure that you yourself are a guide for the blind, a light for those in darkness, <sup>20</sup>an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth,</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you call yourself a Jew:</strong> This clause refers to this person knowing that his parents were Jews, therefore he was a Jew. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you say you are Jewish</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you have the name “Jew”</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are of the Jewish people</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you:</strong> This letter was for all Roman believers to read. But here Paul wrote as if he was talking to a Jew. This Jew was someone who was proud of having the Law of Moses and all the knowledge and insight that it gave him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a footnote to explain would be helpful to the readers. Here is an example footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Paul now wrote to the Roman believers as if speaking to a Jew. This Jew was proud of having the Law of Moses and all the knowledge and insight that it gave him.</p></blockquote><h4>2:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>if you rely on the law</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and trust in the law <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Moses</span></p></li><li><p>If you<sup>(plur)</sup> are sure <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that God accepts you because</span> you know <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> laws,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>rely on the law:</strong> Here the phrase <em>rely on</em> means “to depend on.” The Jews regarded their possession of the laws that God gave to Moses as something that made them right with God.

The BSB does not translate this word and it may not be necessary in some languages to translate it. However, if it would be more natural in your language to translate this word, here are other ways to translate it:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For example (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In the same way<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Alford (page 335).</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Circumcision has value if you observe the law:</strong> Here the <em>if</em>-clause comes after the then-clause. This makes the then-clause the topic. In some languages the <em>if</em>-clause must come first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if you obey the law, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">then</span> circumcision indeed is of value</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Circumcision:</strong> The word “circumcise” means to cut off the loose skin at the end of a boy’s penis. The father or a man who specialized in doing circumcision would do that. Among the Jews, <em>Circumcision</em> is a religious ritual which serves as a sign that they have a covenant with God (Genesis 17:9–14).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some cultures, it is acceptable to translate explicitly the meaning “cut off the loose skin at the end of a boy’s penis.” In other cultures, it is necessary to speak more generally or use a euphemism to describe this event. Here are some examples:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Cutting the skin</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Marking <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the body to show he belongs to God</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Receiving the mark</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some cultures people do not circumcise babies, and in some cultures they do not circumcise any males. In other cultures circumcision is done for different reasons than Jewish circumcision. If that is true in your culture, you may want to include a footnote to explain the Jewish custom. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Circumcision is the cutting off of the skin at the end of the penis. Every male Jew was required to be circumcised. Circumcision was the sign that he was a member of the community with whom God had made a covenant.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">But if you have already included a footnote in other books of the Bible (for instance Luke 1:59), you may want to refer your readers there. Here is an example footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>See footnote on circumcision at Luke 1:59.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>has value:</strong> God gave circumcision to Abraham and his descendants as a sign of his covenant with them. It showed that they were a member of his people.

In some languages a footnote to explain the context would be helpful to the reader. Here is an example footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The lines in Psalm 51:4 before this quote are “Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight.” David was thinking of his own wrongdoing, and how God is always right when he speaks.</p></blockquote><h4>3:4d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:4d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“So that You may be proved right when You speak</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“So that you may be shown to be correct/right/true in what you have said,</p></li><li><p>“The purpose is that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all that happens</span> will show that your words are true,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So that:</strong> These words probably introduces purpose.

This interpretation sees the Greek word as middle voice. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you will win your case in court (NLT) <em>(NLT, GW, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>you judge</u> here. This follows the meaning in the Hebrew of Psalm 51:4. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>prevail when you judge (NIV) <em>(BSB, NIV, NJB, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because that is the plain reading of the Greek word.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Alford (page 338), Barrett (page 63) and Lenski (page 213) support interpretation (1). The Greek verb <em>krinō</em>, “judge” is never considered “deponent,” meaning that the passive ending really has an active meaning.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>victorious:</strong> This word refers to winning a fight or contest. When God judges, no one will be able to change his mind or avoid what God says is his punishment. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>win (NLT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:4d–e</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">These words are a quote found in Psalm 51:4.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if our unrighteousness highlights the righteousness of God, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">then</span> might we ask this: “Is God unjust to inflict his wrath on us?”</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if our unrighteousness highlights the righteousness of God, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">then</span> we might ask this: “Is God unjust to inflict his wrath on us?”</p></blockquote><h4>3:5a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:5a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But if our unrighteousness highlights the righteousness of God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ But if our<sup>(incl)</sup> evil deeds show that God is righteous <span data-bnType=\"implied\">more clearly</span>,</p></li><li><p>¶ When we do evil things/deeds, that shows <span data-bnType=\"implied\">more clearly</span> that what God does is right.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But:</strong> There is some contrast between God judging rightly (3:4) and people’s evil deeds showing that God is righteous (3:5a). Many English versions begin this verse with <em>But</em>. However, in some languages it is more natural not to indicate contrast here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If our evil deeds show… (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if our unrighteousness highlights the righteousness of God:</strong> Here the word <em>if</em> introduces a situation that is true. If this first part is true, that supports the second part (“what shall we say?”).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, using an <em>if</em>-clause would have a different meaning. If that is true in your language, translate the correct meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>since our unrighteousness highlights the righteousness of God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>our unrighteousness highlights the righteousness of God. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">True?</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">So</span>…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Would you agree that</span> our unrighteousness highlights the righteousness of God? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">So</span>…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You would agree that</span> our unrighteousness highlights the righteousness of God. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">So</span>…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>our unrighteousness highlights the righteousness of God:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>highlights</em> is literally “demonstrates.” It means that our sins are in contrast to God’s righteous deeds.

God is surely not unrighteous to inflict wrath on us, (is he)?” The last question answers the first question. The last question expects an answer of “no, he is righteous to do that.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The words <em>what shall we say?</em> introduces what someone might say based on “our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God.” Paul showed that he did not agree that we should say that <em>God is unjust to inflict His wrath on us</em>, when he said “Certainly not!” in 3:6a. Your translation should indicate or imply that Paul was not agreeing that God is unrighteous here. A literal translation in some languages may not do that. If that is true in your language, you should indicate or imply that Paul was not agreeing <em>That God is unjust to inflict His wrath on us</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>shall we say, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as some do,</span> that God is unjust to inflict his wrath on us?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>what shall we say?

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Shall we say</span> that</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to inflict His wrath on us:</strong> This phrase refers to punishing in anger.

There is no theoretical reason why an unjust deity should not preside in an unjust judgment. Paul’s point is rather that, assuming as all do that God will judge the world, some must be punished. Unless this happens, what occurs will not be judgment. It is the exercise of wrath, not the character of God, that is the point of it all.”</span></span> It asks, “If God is not righteous, by what standard would he use to judge?” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>how will God judge (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The English words “can” or <em>could</em> have a similar meaning here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the world:</strong> Here this phrase refers to all people whoever lived.

In this section, Paul spoke to someone, probably a Jew, who might think that Paul implied that God was unfaithful to his covenant with the Jews. Paul showed that regardless of how God’s people had behaved, God was always faithful to what he said.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Keep in mind that Paul himself was a Jew. He knew how Jews thought, and he knew how to answer their objections.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God is faithful to his covenant even if his people are not</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God keeps his word and does what is right</p></blockquote></div><h4>3:7a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>However, if my falsehood accentuates God’s truthfulness, to the increase of His glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?:</strong> This verse is similar to 3:5. Paul was speaking generally of lying making God’s truth more clear. He said <em>my falsehood</em>, but was referring generally to lying. He is probably not confessing a specific sin here.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Morris says, “It is essentially the same argument as that in v. 5, but stated this time in terms of falsehood and truthfulness (or ‘truth’).”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that Paul was confessing that he was lying about something. If that is true in your language, translate in a way that indicates that the meaning is more general. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But if through <u>our</u> falsehood God’s truthfulness is accentuated to the increase of his glory, why are <u>we</u> still being condemned as sinners?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Someone might argue, “If my falsehood enhances God’s truthfulness and so increases his glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?” (NIV)</p></blockquote><h4>3:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>However, if my falsehood accentuates God’s truthfulness, to the increase of His glory,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But, if the true <span data-bnType=\"implied\">words</span> of God are more clear because of my lie, and as a result, he is honored more,</p></li><li><p>Our<sup>(incl)</sup> lies show even more that God’s words/message is true, and so, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> honor him more.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>However:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is a textual issue in 3:7a: (1) Some Greek manuscripts have the word <u>and/but</u> (BSB, RSV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, REB, ESV). (2) Some Greek manuscripts have the word <u>for</u> (KJV, NET). It is recommended that you follow option (1).</span></span> There is some contrast here to 3:6b. So some English versions translate the Greek conjunction as <em>However</em>. However, some English versions do not see contrast here and so omit the conjunction. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If my lie increases… (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if my falsehood accentuates God’s truthfulness, to the increase of His glory:</strong> Here the word <em>if</em> introduces a situation that is true. If this first part is true, that supports the second part (“why am I still condemned as a sinner?”).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, using an <em>if</em>-clause would have a different meaning. If that is true in your language, translate the correct meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>my falsehood accentuates God’s truthfulness, to the increase of his glory. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">True?</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">So</span>…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Would you agree that</span> my falsehood accentuates God’s truthfulness, to the increase of his glory? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">So</span>…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You would agree that</span> my falsehood accentuates God’s truthfulness, to the increase of his glory. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">So</span>…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>my falsehood accentuates God’s truthfulness, to the increase of His glory:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>my falsehood accentuates God’s truthfulness</em> is literally “the truthfulness of God is much in my falsehood.” The BSB put the phrase <em>my falsehood</em> before the subject <em>God’s truthfulness</em>, probably for emphasis. But the phrase in the Greek is not emphasized in that way. Follow normal phrase order in your language here. In English here is a more normal word order:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s truthfulness abounds to the increase of his glory through/in my falsehood</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek tense on this verb usually is translated as past tense. But many English versions use the present tense, because the English present tense is used to indicate a general statement. The lie could refer to being unfaithful to promises (3:3), but here it probably is general, referring to any sin. Consider how to translate this word so that it indicates a general statement.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>my falsehood:</strong> This phrase is literally “in/through my falsehood.” It indicates that this <em>falsehood</em> caused God’s “truthfulness” to more clearly be seen. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>by means of my falsehood</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p><u>my falsehood makes</u> God’s truth abundantly clear</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p><u>my lie</u> increases the glory that God receives <u>by showing that</u> God is truthful (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p><u>on account of my lies</u>, the trueness of God’s word is increasingly seen<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>accentuates:</strong> This word means “be much.” Here it refers to God’s truth being more clearly shown. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>making his truth stand out more clearly (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>highlights (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>abounds (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages one cannot speak of truthfulness being “accentuated.” If that is true in your language, indicate that people see more and more of God’s truth. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>is increasingly seen<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>being more apparent<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>makes it apparent that God’s word is true</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>God’s truthfulness:</strong> Here this phrase refers to God’s words; they are true. Whenever God speaks, he says what is true. In some languages a literal translation is not possible. If that is true in your language, refer to his words being true. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>God’s truth (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>showing that <u>God is truthful</u></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the trueness of God’s word<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>glory:</strong> Here this word refers to people praising and honoring God because they recognize his greatness and majesty. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>great honor (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>he is honored/praised<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also <u>glory, sense A3(a)</u> in the KBT.</p><h4>3:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>why am I still condemned as a sinner?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>why should <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> still judge me as guilty for being a sinner?</p></li><li><p>Let us not say, “Then <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he</span> should not continue to punish us as wrongdoers!”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>why am I still condemned as a sinner?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question based on what Paul said in 3:7a. Paul implied here that it was wrong to think that an excuse for sin would be that it increases God’s truth and therefore his glory. Translate this with that meaning. Here are some ways:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Why should I still be condemned as a sinner?

(NJB)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>why am I still condemned:</strong> The Greek is literally “why still am even I being judged/condemned.” The Greek word that means “even I” indicates emphasis on the meaning of <em>I</em>. If possible translate this emphasis. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>why is it I who is still being condemned</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>why is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God/he</span> still condemning me</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>still:</strong> Here this word indicates that God condemned this person <u>even though</u> his lie caused God’s truth to be shown more clearly and more people honor him (3:7a).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sinner:</strong> This word refers to a person who sins.</p>",

Some English versions add the word “No,” perhaps for a more natural English expression.

You may want to use “I” to indicate that Paul was not including Jews here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>have already made the charge:</strong> This phrase means “accused beforehand.” Paul said earlier in this letter that Jews and non-Jews are sinners. Now he reminded his readers that he said that. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>have already accused (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>said before that they were to blame</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>already said that…are all guilty (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>already said that…all have sin<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Greeks:</strong> The basic meaning of this word is “people who are from Greece.” But in the New Testament the word usually refers to anyone who is not a Jew. So it includes Romans and other non-Jewish peoples. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer only to people from Greece. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use a more general word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Gentiles (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the literal meaning and explain it in a footnote. Here is an example footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This word in the New Testament usually refers to anyone who is not a Jew.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>under sin:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>under sin</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means that all people <u>are sinners</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>guilty of sin (NCV) <em>(NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means that all people <u>are under the power of sin</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>under the dominion of sin (NJB) <em>(RSV, NIV11, GNT, NJB, NABRE, NLT, GW, CEV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The BSB, NIV84, ESV, NASB, KJV, and NET translate literally, but the phrase <em>under sin</em> is not clear as to its exact meaning in English. It could mean interpretation (1) or (2). If a literal translation in your language allows for interpretation (1), you may want to translate that way.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">But if a literal translation in your language will only follow interpretation (2), it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because the examples of <em>under sin</em> in 3:10–18 clearly refer to people responsible for their sin and not to sin controlling them.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Longenecker, Lenski, and Alford support interpretation (1). Some scholars refer to 7:14 to support “under the power of sin” here, but this author feels the context is too different to be a good parallel.</span></span> Also, interpretation (1) fits better with the Greek word that the BSB translates as “we have already made the charge,” as those responsible rather than being victims.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are other ways to translate this phrase according to interpretation (1):</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>are sinners<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sin habitually<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Yakan Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sin:</strong> This word refers to doing something that God said is wrong to do, or not doing something that God said they should do.</p>",

God did this by sending Jesus Christ to stand in the place of every wrongdoer and take the punishment that every wrongdoer deserves. So then, when a person believes in Jesus as the one who has taken the punishment on his behalf, God makes that person right with himself. In this way God remains true to his righteous character, for wrongdoing has been punished.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Since God did that, believers cannot boast in themselves. Paul also said that this faith in Jesus supports the law of Moses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Righteousness Through Faith (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>How We Are Put Right with God (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God Gives Us His Approval as a Gift (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s Way of Accepting People (CEV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>3:21a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:21a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ But now the righteousness from God has been shown that does not depend on the law <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Moses</span>,</p></li><li><p>¶ But recently God has shown how he will make people right with himself.

It may also indicate a new period of time. It introduces Jesus dying on the cross and God resurrecting him, which occurred about twenty-five years before Paul wrote this letter. Consider how to translate that meaning in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But at this time<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>apart from the law:</strong> This phrase indicates that the law of Moses does not help people get this righteousness of God that he has revealed through Jesus. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It has nothing to do with law (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>without keeping the requirements of the law (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>not on the basis of obeying the laws <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Moses</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But we do not become straight in his sight from our following the Lord’s Law.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the righteousness of God has been revealed:</strong> The word <em>revealed</em> means that, by what Jesus did, God showed people how they can be righteous before God without following the law of Moses.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is passive. Some languages must translate it as an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God has shown us a way to be made right with him (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God has a way to make people right with him…and he has now shown us that way (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the righteousness of God:</strong> There are three ways to interpret the Greek word ending that the BSB translates as <em>of</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Here it indicates that <u>God makes people right in their relationship with him</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a way to be made right with him (NLT) <em>(GNT, NJB, NLT, GW, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Here it indicates that <u>God enables believers to behave in right ways</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a righteousness from God (NIV84) <em>(NIV84)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Here it refers to <u>the righteousness that God has</u>. This is the natural way to interpret the meaning of the word <em>of</em> in English here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the righteousness of God (REB) <em>(BSB, ESV, RSV, NIV11, NASB, KJV, NABRE, NET, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because many scholars and versions support it.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example, Cranfield (page 202) says it is “as…in 1:17,…a status of righteousness before God….” Morris (page 173) says it is “the right standing that comes from God.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are other ways to translate this phrase according to interpretation (1):</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>how God does make us acceptable to him (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God has a way to make people right with him (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>3:21b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:21b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>as attested by the Law and the Prophets.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but the law <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Moses</span> and the prophets spoke about it.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The books of</span> the Laws <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Moses</span> and the Prophets tell about this way of making people right.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as attested by the Law and the Prophets:</strong> The Greek is literally “being testified to by the law and the prophets.” The words in the Old Testament (<em>the Law and the Prophets</em>) do not help people get the righteousness of God. But some of those words speak about this righteousness.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There is an implied contrast in this phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>even though</u> the Law of Moses and the prophets gave their witness to it (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural not to translate the contrast. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to which the Law and the Prophets testify (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as was promised in the Law and the Prophets</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Law and the Prophets tell of it.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>attested:</strong> This word means “report what one saw.” The word is often used where the person is expected to be truthful and accurate. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>testify (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>told us about (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Law and the Prophets:</strong> Here this phrase refers to the whole Old Testament. In some languages the meaning of this phrase would not be clear. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain it in the text. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the books of</span> the Laws <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Moses</span> and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the books of</span> the Prophets</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the books of</span> the Laws <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Moses</span> and the Prophets</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the Prophets:</strong> <em>Prophets</em> are people who speak on behalf of God. God’s message may be in words or visions. The prophets then tell the people God’s message. See how you translated this word in 1:2.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase here implies the writings of the prophets in the Old Testament. In some languages it would be more natural or more clear to indicate that. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the writings of…the prophets (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the writings of the past that God caused…the prophets to write<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Tagbanwa Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to the one who does not work:</strong> Here the word <em>to</em> indicates that God does something <u>for</u> <em>the one who does not work</em>.

If you need to translate <em>Him</em> as “God,” consider that now <em>who justifies the wicked</em> is a descriptive relative clause. But some languages do not use descriptive relative clauses. In those languages, “God who justifies the wicked” would indicate that there are many gods and only this one justifies the ungodly. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate the pronoun <em>Him</em> literally anyway, and not as “God.”</p></li><li><p>Translate without using a descriptive relative clause.

In this section, Paul used that example to show that all people must believe in God for him to call them righteous. He did that for Abraham before Abraham was circumcised. So that shows that God makes people right with himself because they believe in him and not because they are circumcised.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Example of Abraham (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God called Abraham righteous because he believed</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Abraham is/as an example of how to become righteous before God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The lesson/model of God calling Abraham righteous because he believed God</p></blockquote></div><h4>4:9a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">4:9 starts with the Greek conjunction that probably introduces the next topic that Paul wanted to write about. It indicates only a general connection to the previous verses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Is this blessing only on the circumcised, or also on the uncircumcised?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. It introduces two possibilities as to whom the blessing is for. Paul wanted his readers to ponder the answer to this question before he answered it in 4:10–12. There are at least three ways to translate this meaning.</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now, is this blessing only for the Jews, or is it also for uncircumcised Gentiles? (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>With 4:9a as a rhetorical question and 4:9b providing the answer. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Does this happiness that David spoke of belong only to those who are circumcised? No indeed! It belongs also to those who are not circumcised. (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This blessing is not only for the circumcised, but also for the uncircumcised.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">If possible, translate 4:9a–b as a rhetorical question, because Paul answered it in 4:10–12, not here.</p><h4>4:9a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:9a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Is this blessing only on the circumcised,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Then, the people that are blessed in this way, are they only those who are circumcised,</p></li><li><p>¶ God blesses people in that way, both the people who are circumcised</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the circumcised:</strong> The word <em>circumcised</em> refers to cutting off the loose skin at the end of a boy’s or man’s penis. See how you translated this word in 2:25 or 3:30.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>the</em> indicates that this phrase refers to a group of people, including men, women and children, whose men and boys are circumcised. They all participate in the covenant that includes circumcision. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people who are</span> circumcised</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people with</span> their <span data-bnType=\"implied\">males’</span> foreskin removed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a euphemism is adequate to explain this meaning.

See how you translated this word in 2:25 or 3:30.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>the</em> indicates that this phrase refers to a group of people, including the women and children, whose men are uncircumcised.

The Greek can also be read as direct speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We say, “Faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">But the Greek here differs from the words of Genesis 15:6 and its quote in Romans 4:3. So many English versions add the word <em>that</em>.</p><h4>4:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>We have been saying that</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For we<sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">always</span> say this:</p></li><li><p>We have already said that (NCV)</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">4:9c begins with the Greek word that is usually translated “for.” It introduces the basis for Paul saying that the blessing is also for the uncircumcised. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Well, (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is more natural to imply the connection and omit this word.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>We have been saying that:</strong> The verb <em>have been saying</em> here is in the present tense. This probably implies what is usually said. Paul and perhaps his readers often say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness (4:9d). English can use the simple present tense for that meaning, as the ESV does:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We say that (ESV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:9d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:9d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Abraham’s faith was credited to him as righteousness.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> saw that Abraham believed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in him</span> and for that reason he declared him as upright.</p></li><li><p>God accepted Abraham&apos;s faith and that faith made him right with God. (NCV)</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Abraham’s faith was credited to him as righteousness:</strong> This clause is similar to “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness” (4:3b–c) and “his faith is credited as righteousness” (4:5c). Translate the clause here in a similar way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Abraham’s faith was counted to him as righteousness</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> credited Abraham’s faith as righteousness</p></blockquote>",

God did not promise blessing because Abraham obeyed the law of Moses. Paul then described how Abraham believed and why God called him righteous. Paul then explained that God also calls the people who believe in God (and his Messiah, Jesus) righteous.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God counts people as righteous through faith, not through the Law Of Moses</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God also called us<sup>(incl)</sup> righteous because we believe</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The lesson/model of God calling Abraham righteous applies to us/believers</p></blockquote></div><h4>4:16a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:16a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Therefore, the promise comes by faith,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Therefore the promise requires believing/faith <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in God</span>,</p></li><li><p>¶ And so he/God gave the promise to the people who believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in him</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Therefore:</strong> This word introduces a conclusion about what Paul wrote in 4:13–15. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And so (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For this reason (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the promise comes by faith:</strong> The Greek is more literally “of faith.” There is an implied subject and verb. In English the implied subject is translated <em>the promise</em> and refers to God’s promise, as in 4:13a.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The topic of 4:13–14 is the promise. 4:14c refers to the promise and 4:15 is an aside about the law. About “(it is) of faith” in 4:16a, Nicoll (page 619) says, “the subject is the promise, considered in reference to the mode of its fulfillment.” Moo (on TW) calls it “the promised inheritance.”</span></span> The promise was given to Abraham because of his faith. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>people receive God’s promise by having faith (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the promise is received by faith (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the promise:</strong> The word <em>promise</em> refers back to the same promise of 4:13–14. In some languages it is more clear to refer back to it. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that promise</p></blockquote><h4>4:16b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:16b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that it may rest on grace</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that the promise is according to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his/God’s</span> grace/kindness,</p></li><li><p>so that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> promise was given because he is kind,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that it may rest on grace:</strong> Faith was the basis for God making the promise to Abraham. The purpose was so that he might give it according to grace. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that the promise may rest on grace (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and the purpose is that the promise may rest on grace</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This purpose has become true already. In some languages it must be translated as result for the correct meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that the promise rests on grace</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>may rest on grace:</strong> The Greek is literally “(it may be) according to grace.” God promised to give Abraham and his descendants the world because he wanted to, not because he needed to. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it will be based on his grace<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it would be clear that his grace…is the origin, not their own deeds<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Tagbanwa Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>this might be possible by means of his kindness<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Western Bukidnon Manobo Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It is given as a free gift (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it can be a gift (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>grace:</strong> Here the word <em>grace</em> indicates that God did something kind. He wants to help people. People do not deserve this help. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>as a free gift (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>his great kindness (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:16c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:16c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and may be guaranteed to all Abraham’s offspring—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and so that it is certain for all of his children/descendants.</p></li><li><p>and that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will certainly give it to all of his/Abraham’s descendants.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and:</strong> Here the word <em>and</em> indicates that 4:16c expresses a second purpose (after the first one in 4:16b). In some languages it is more clear to introduce the clause again. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in order that it</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>guaranteed:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>guaranteed</em> means “valid, sure, legally secure.” God will certainly give the world to Abraham and those who have faith like his. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>secure (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>certain (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>assured (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:16d–e</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not only to those who are of the law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham:</strong> Paul had two groups of Abraham’s spiritual children in mind, <em>those who are of the law</em> (Jewish believers) and <em>those who are of the faith of Abraham</em> (non-Jewish believers).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrases <em>not only</em> and <em>but also</em> emphasizes the second group. Some Jews thought that a person had to become a Jew first (by following the Law of Moses) for God to accept him or her. But Paul emphasized here that God accepts everyone who has the same faith as Abraham, even if they do not follow the law of Moses. Consider how to translate that emphasis.</p><h4>4:16d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:16d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>not only to those who are of the law,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It is promised</span> not only to the person who has the law <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Moses</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and believes</span></p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God will certainly fulfill it</span> for not only those who possess the laws <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Moses</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and believe in him</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those who are of the law:</strong> The Greek is literally “the (one) of the law.” It is similar to “those who live by the law” in 4:14a. The word <em>of</em> indicates that this person is connected to the law of Moses. It refers to the Jews. Translate it in a similar way to the phrase in 4:14a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase refers generally to Jews. The singular emphasizes that this statement is true for each person. In some languages it is more natural to use the plural in a general reference. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to the adherent of the law (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people who have/possess the laws <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Moses</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The context implies that these people also believe in God. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly imply they do not believe. If that is true in your language, add the implied information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the adherent of the law <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who believes</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>someone who has the law <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Moses</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and believes in God</span></p></blockquote><h4>4:16e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:16e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but also to the person who has the same faith as Abraham,</p></li><li><p>but also to those who believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in God</span> as Abraham <span data-bnType=\"implied\">did</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those who are of the faith of Abraham:</strong> This phrase refers to those who believe in God as Abraham did. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>anyone who lives with faith like that of Abraham (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>all who are Abraham’s descendants because they have faith, just as he did (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:16f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:16f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He is the father of us all.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>who is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> the father of all of us<sup>(incl)</sup>,</p></li><li><p>He/Abraham is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> a father to all of us <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in/regarding believing in God</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He is the father of us all:</strong> This clause tells the reader more about Abraham. In some languages a literal translation would not have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, consider how to translate the correct meaning. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here, as the BSB does.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the father of us all:</strong> The word <em>father</em> is a figure of speech here, similar to its use in 4:11–12. God chose to bless the world through Abraham. That choice was based upon Abraham’s faith in God. In that way he became the father (or ancestor) for all those who later believe, because he was the first one to do so. So the meaning of <em>father</em> here is broader than just in terms of a father to child kind of descent.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages translating <em>father</em> literally would imply a literal ancestor. If that is true in your language, indicate that it has a figurative meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> the father of us all</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God made to be thought of as</span> the father of us all</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as-if the ancestor of us all<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>whom we consider as father of us all <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in faith</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the spiritual father of us all (GNT)</p></blockquote>",

Both activities are characteristic of him.”</span></span> Here the word <em>calls</em> does not refer only to calling Abraham the father of many nations.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>If it only referred to calling Abraham the father of many nations, Paul probably would have used the aorist tense rather than the (general/gnomic) present tense.

The <em>hope</em> in the phrase “in hope” refers to Abraham confidently expecting God to fulfill his promise. The <em>hope</em> in the phrase “against hope” refers to Abraham wanting children very much but after so many years of not being able to have children, he did not expect to suddenly begin by their own power.

(2) Some Greek manuscripts have the words <u>considered not</u> (KJV only).

In some languages a different word or phrase must be used for the correct meaning. This also may require a new sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>It</u> was as good as dead</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>(ESV:) was as good as dead:</strong> The Greek is more literally “having been dead.” It is a figure of speech here.

So the BSB and some other English versions put this clause in parentheses to indicate that. It explains “good as dead” in 4:19b. Here are other ways to punctuate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>—since he was about a hundred years old— (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because he was about a hundred years old, (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is more natural to begin a sentence with background information.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the deadness of Sarah’s womb (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that Sarah’s womb was dead (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his body was as good as dead—<u>and so was Sarah’s womb</u> (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">But in some languages a literal translation would not have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, translate the correct meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Sarah was unable to have children (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Sara his wife was barren<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>she could not give birth<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Yakan Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Sarah’s womb:</strong> This phrase refers to the place where a baby lives and grows before the mother gives birth. Some languages have a polite way to refer to this place. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Sarah’s tummy/stomach</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Also see the examples above.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Sarah’s:</strong> Sarah was Abraham’s wife. In some languages people would not know that. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain that here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">his wife</span> Sarah’s</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:19a–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">4:19b–d is background information to 4:19a. In some languages it is more natural to have the background information first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>19b</sup>When he acknowledged his own body, which was as good as dead <sup>19c</sup>(since he was about a hundred years old), <sup>19d</sup>or when he acknowledged the lifelessness of Sarah’s womb, <sup>19a</sup>he did not weaken in faith.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>19b</sup>He acknowledged his own body as good as dead <sup>19c</sup>because he was about a hundred years old, <sup>19d</sup>and acknowledged Sarah’s womb also as good as dead, <sup>19a</sup>but he did not weaken in faith.</p></blockquote><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:18a–19d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">People of some language groups are not familiar with the story of Abraham, and so the purpose of 4:18 may not be clear until reading 4:19. If that is true of people in your language, you may want to have the words of 4:19 first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>19b</sup>When he acknowledged his own body, which was as good as dead <sup>19c</sup>(since he was about a hundred years old), <sup>19d</sup>or when he acknowledged the barrenness of Sarah’s womb, <sup>19a</sup>he did not weaken in faith. <sup>18a</sup>In hope he believed against hope, <sup>18b</sup>that he should become the father of many nations, <sup>18c</sup>as he had been told, <sup>18d</sup>“So shall your offspring be.”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">You will then need to mark these two verses as <sup>18–19</sup>.</p></div>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>insides/liver</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>mind and will</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Holy Spirit:</strong> This phrase refers to God’s Spirit. The word <em>Spirit</em> is used in a similar way to when a person refers to his own spirit. The word <em>Holy</em> here means “clean” or “sacred.” But it also refers to “coming from God.” Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Sacred/Holy Spirit</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Pure/Clean Spirit</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Spirit who comes from God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this phrase in Matthew 1:18, Luke 1:15, or 1 Thessalonians 1:5.</p><h4>5:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>whom He has given us.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>whom he/God has given to us.</p></li><li><p>God has also given the Holy Spirit to us.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>whom He has given us:</strong> In the Greek, this clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause.

It does not separate the Holy Spirit from other spirits. For the correct meaning in some languages, translators must avoid the word <em>whom</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He was given to us <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by God</span>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> gave him to us.</p></blockquote>",

Just like it is true that God justifies us by the blood of Christ, it is also true that Jesus will save us from God’s wrath. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if God has already counted us as righteous because of Cristo’s blood which flowed-out at his death, we expect <u>yet even-more</u> that Cristo will save-us from God’s judging of people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So [having-said] that, we have become straight in God’s sight because of Yesus’ blood who died to pay-for our sins.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he will save us</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>saved:</strong> This word refers to being rescued from something harmful or dangerous. Here it refers to God rescuing people from his wrath.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages must say what someone is saved from to make clear what kind of saving is meant.

If this first part is true, that supports the second part (“how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through His life”) to also be true.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here the word <em>if</em> does not indicate that <em>when we were enemies of God, we were reconciled to Him</em> might not be true. In some languages a literal translation would indicate this incorrect meaning. If that is true in your language, translate the correct meaning without using <em>if</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>consider this: when we were enemies, we were reconciled to him by the death of his Son, therefore</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it is true that when we were enemies, we were reconciled to him by the death of his Son, therefore</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when we were enemies we were reconciled to him by the death of his Son, therefore</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we were enemies of God:</strong> The Greek is more literally “being enemies,” but it clearly implies here that we were hostile toward God and so <em>enemies</em> against him. Some languages will need to make that clear here, as the BSB does. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we were enemies <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with/against God</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we were reconciled to Him through the death of His Son:</strong> This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">he</span> reconciled us to God by his death</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the death of his Son restored our relationship with God (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Christ reconciled us to God by dying for us (JBP)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>reconciled:</strong> This word means “end anger and re-establish a good relationship.” Jesus, by his death, made the way to end God’s anger against our sins and restored our relationship with him.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>through the death of His Son:</strong> Jesus dying made the way for us to be reconciled to God, because he took the punishment for our sins. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>by the death of his Son (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>because his Son died for us (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>because of His son allowing Himself to be killed<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Western Bukidnon Manobo Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>because of his Child/Son having died because of us (incl)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Yakan Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the death of His Son:</strong> The noun <em>death</em> describes an event. Some languages must use a verb. See the examples above.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>His Son:</strong> This phrase refers to Jesus.

See how you translated the words <em>how much more</em> in 5:9.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>having been reconciled:</strong> This clause in Greek is literally “we/us having been reconciled.” The context implies that we are still reconciled at the present time.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he reconciled us <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he reconciled us <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and God</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>shall we be saved through His life!:</strong> This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his life will save us</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause refers to what Christ does for us in the present and will do in the future, because he always lives to intercede for us (Hebrews 7:24–25). The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>through</em> is often translated as “in.” The word “in” implies that we share <u>in</u> Christ’s life.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Jewett (page 367) says, “While the new life shared with Christ will climax in “eternal life” (v. 21), its redemptive power is experienced by the faithful as they are enabled to boast in a transformed manner in the very midst of their tribulations.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul used the word <em>life</em> here to contrast to “death” in 5:10a. You should keep that meaning in your translation here. But the noun <em>life</em> describes an event. Some languages must use a verb.

In some languages “receive” and “take” are translated by the same word. If that is true in your language, you should probably avoid translating “receive/take” literally here. Also some languages must translate <em>reconciliation</em> as a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who has reconciled us <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause tells the reader more about Jesus.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But not as the offence, so also [is] the free gift (KJV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But also the gift is indeed not like the trespass</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the gift:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>gift</em> refers to salvation or reconciliation (5:8–11). The opportunity to be saved and reconciled to God is given to us for free. We cannot earn that opportunity.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages what the gift is must be explained. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the gift <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of salvation/reconciliation</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the gift <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Jesus saving/reconciling us</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>trespass:</strong> This word in Greek generally refers to falling because you did something wrong. Here it has a more figurative sense and means “a violation of moral standards.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDAG (page 770).</span></span> Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>failure (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wrongdoing (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This word is similar in meaning to “sin” here. In some languages “sin” is the best translation of this word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sin (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>5:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For if the many died by the trespass of the one man,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For if all those people died because of that one man’s sin,</p></li><li><p>Consider this: one man failed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to follow God’s command</span>, therefore many, many people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">sinned and</span> died.

If this first part is true, that supports the second part (“how much more did God’s grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many!”) (5:15c) to also be true.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here the word <em>if</em> does not indicate that <em>the many died by the trespass of the one man</em> might not be true. In some languages a literal translation would indicate this incorrect meaning. If that is true in your language, translate the correct meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>consider this: many died through one man’s trespass, therefore</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it is true that many died through one man’s trespass, therefore</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>many died through one man’s trespass, therefore</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the many:</strong> Here this phrase refers to a large number of people. Here it refers to “all men” (5:12c). For that reason, many English versions translate the article as well, as the BSB does. Other translations do not translate the article. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>many (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>by the trespass of the one man:</strong> The word <em>by</em> indicates that Adam’s sin caused sin to enter the world and so all people sin and therefore die (5:12). Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because of the sin of that one man (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the sin of this one man, Adam, <u>brought</u> death to many (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>From</u> the transgression of that one person, all mankind die.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><h4>5:15c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:15c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>how much more did God’s grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>then the grace/kindness of God and the gift that another man, Jesus Christ, gave in his grace/kindness overflowed much more to all people.</p></li><li><p>God was much more kind to many, many people, and in the same way another man, Jesus Christ, kindly gave them a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">great</span> gift.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>how much more did God’s grace and the gift…abound to the many!:</strong> Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>much more did the grace of God and the gift…abound to the many (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But God’s grace is much greater, and so is his free gift to so many people (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the grace of God and the gift…have had a much greater effect</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>how much more:</strong> This phrase is emphasized in the Greek and the BSB. In some languages the meaning is more clear by not emphasizing this phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the grace of God and the free gift…have abounded for many <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> <u>much more</u></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase emphasizes what follows. See how you translated this phrase in 5:9–10.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>abound:</strong> This word refers to having much of something, even having more than enough. Believers have no lack of the grace of God and the free gift of Jesus Christ. Here are other ways to translate this Greek word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>overflow (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>been given fully</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ:</strong> The word <em>by</em> indicates that the grace of Jesus caused the free gift to be available to all people. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the gift given through the kindness of one person, Jesus Christ (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the gift:</strong> The word here in Greek is a different word than “gift” in 5:15a. Probably “the grace of God” and <em>the gift</em> are parts of “the gift” of 5:15a. Some scholars think the Greek word here refers to the Holy Spirit, but others think it refers to something else. You should not say what the gift is here.</p>",

Paul said that the gift is not like what Adam’s sin caused to happen. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the free gift is not like the effect of that one man’s sin (RSV) <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, ESV, NABRE, NASB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The word “through” is to be <u>omitted</u>. It does not contribute to the meaning here.

Moo (on TW) supports interpretation (2) in his translation, but supports interpretation (1) in his prose: “Since ‘the one who sinned’ does not make an adequate contrast with ‘the gift,’ we have to assume the point of contrast from the context; and perhaps the ‘condemnation’ from the following verse is the best alternative. We might then paraphrase, ‘and the gift is not like the condemnation that came through the one who sinned.’”</span></span> Here are other ways to translate this clause according to interpretation (1):</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The gift is not like <em>that which came</em> through the one who sinned (NASB)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NASB uses italicized words to indicate that words they have added to give the English the correct meaning.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Another distinction between God’s gift and the result of one man’s sin is this.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And here is another difference between this gift of God and that not good result of the sin of Adam.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Based on the Tagbanwa Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the gift:</strong> The word here in Greek is the same word as in 5:15c. Translate it in the same way here.</p><h4>5:16b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The judgment that followed one sin brought condemnation, but the gift that followed many trespasses brought justification:</strong> There are two Greek words that combined can be translated using the English idiom “on one hand” and “on the other hand.” They contrast the two clauses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>on the one hand</u> the judgment arose from one transgression resulting in condemnation, but <u>on the other hand</u> the free gift arose from many transgressions resulting in justification (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">A simple translation in English is <em>but</em>, as in the BSB.</p><h4>5:16b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:16b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The judgment that followed one sin brought condemnation,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For that one <span data-bnType=\"implied\">man’s</span> sin caused God to judge him, which then caused God to punish him,</p></li><li><p>For God judged the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">one man’s</span> one sin and said he was guilty and named/told the punishment.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek, 5:16b begins with a word that is usually translated as “for.” It introduces an explanation of 5:16a. It does not introduce a reason here. The BSB does not translate this word, but many English versions do. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The judgment that followed one sin:</strong> This refers to God judging Adam guilty of sin after Adam disobeyed God’s command.

This helps to make the differences between the two clauses more clear. If possible, use similar words in both clauses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the judicial action, <u>following on</u> the one offence, <strong>resulted in</strong> a verdict of condemnation, but the act of grace, <u>following on</u> so many misdeeds, <strong>resulted in</strong> a verdict of acquittal (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>After</u> that one man sinned <span data-bnType=\"implied\">once</span>, it <strong>caused</strong> God to judge him guilty. But <u>after</u> many sins God’s free gift came, and it <strong>caused</strong> God to make people right with him</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">But in some languages it is better to not have exactly the same words in both places. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>judgment, <u>resulting from</u> the one transgression, <strong>led</strong> to condemnation, but the gracious gift <u>from</u> the many failures <strong>led</strong> to justification (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>following</u> the one sin, God judged and put a burden, but <u>following</u> the sin of many, God’s gift came and took many people and made them righteous<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Based on the Yongkom Back Translation, unpublished manuscript.</span></span></p></blockquote></div>",

It does not introduce a reason here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man:</strong> Here the word <em>if</em> introduces a situation that is true. If this first part is true, that supports the second part (“how much more will those who receive an abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ”) (5:17b–c) to also be true.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here the word <em>if</em> does not indicate that <em>by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man</em> might not be true. In some languages a literal translation would indicate this incorrect meaning. If that is true in your language, translate the correct meaning without using <em>if</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>consider this: death reigned through one man by that one man’s trespass, therefore</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it is true that death reigned through one man by that one man’s trespass, therefore</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>death reigned through one man by that one man’s trespass, therefore</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>by the trespass of the one man:</strong> There are three ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>by</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It introduces <u>the way/means</u> in which death reigned. Death rules all people by way of that one man sinning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>through the sin of one man (GNT) <em>(GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It introduces <u>the instrument</u> in which death reigned. Death rules all people by that one sin of that one man. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>by the trespass of the one man (NIV) <em>(BSB, NIV, NJB, NASB, KJV, NET, REB, NABRE)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It introduces <u>the cause</u> of death reigning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because of one man’s trespass (ESV) <em>(RSV, ESV, NLT, CEV, GW, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because it fits the context best and agrees with “through” later.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Moo, Cranfield, and Witherington translate it as “through.” Very few scholars discuss this and some scholars categorize their choice of English word differently than this author does. I see “means” as indicating that this act of sin by Adam making the way for death to gain power over all people. But “instrument” implies an enduring reality of that particular sin as the tool death used to gain power over all people.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>death reigned:</strong> This phrase indicates that everyone dies. See how you translated it in 5:14.</p><h4>5:17b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>how much more will those who receive an abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ!:</strong> Paul first described what the word <em>those</em> referred to. It referred to believers. They have received <em>an abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness</em>. Then Paul described what they would do: they <em>will…reign in life</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages must present this information differently to make the meaning clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>much more will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believers</span>, they receive the abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness, reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>much more will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believers</span> reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ. They receive the abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness.</p></blockquote><h4>5:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>how much more will those who receive an abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>then the people whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> gave plenty of grace and the gift of being righteous <span data-bnType=\"implied\">before God</span> will much more rule in life</p></li><li><p>believers will rule in life much more. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has given them a great amount of grace and a great gift of being upright <span data-bnType=\"implied\">before God</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>how much more:</strong> Translate this phrase as you did in 5:9 or 5:15.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will…reign in life:</strong> This clause contrasts to “death reigned” in 5:17a. Some scholars think that this clause refers only to after God’s great judgment when believers will reign (Rev 20:4, 22:5). But some scholars think that believers reign now in a figurative way by living victorious lives. If possible translate this clause in a way that allows one or both interpretations.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will rule in life (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will be leaders in life <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with Jesus</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those who receive:</strong> Here the word <em>receive</em> implies that God gave the grace and the gift. In some languages <em>receive</em> and “take” are translated by the same word. If a literal translation would mean “take,” use “give” instead. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> gave</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>an abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness:</strong> In Greek the word <em>abundance</em> applies to both <em>grace</em> and <em>the gift of righteousness</em>. There will always be plenty of grace and the gift of righteousness for the believer. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s abundant provision <u>of</u> grace and <u>of</u> the gift of righteousness (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the abundant amount of grace and the abundant amount of the free gift of righteousness</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s abundant grace and are freely put right with him (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s full grace and the great gift of being made right with him (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the gift of righteousness:</strong> Here the word <em>righteousness</em> indicates that a person’s relationship with God is right. See how you translated this word in 4:3.</p><h4>5:17c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:17c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>through the one man, Jesus Christ!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>through what one person, Jesus Christ, has done <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for them</span>.</p></li><li><p>Through what one man, Jesus Christ, did <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for them, they will rule</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>through the one man, Jesus Christ:</strong> This phrase indicates that Jesus made the way to reign in life.</p>",

Jesus’ resurrection symbolizes the new life that believers can live in. The believers’ old way of life is crucified on the cross of Jesus so that they have no need to follow the desires to sin. Believers will live new lives for God and death no longer rules them, because Jesus died and was raised for them. Therefore believers should consider themselves dead to sin and do the good deeds that God wants them to do. God’s grace removes believers from the rule of sin in their lives.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Believers are dead to sin, so they must live for God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Dead to Sin, Alive in Christ (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We are no longer slaves to sin, but God’s servants</p></blockquote></div><h4>6:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>What then shall we say?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ So then, should we<sup>(incl)</sup> ask this question?</p></li><li><p>¶ Therefore, is it right to say that</p></li><li><p>¶ And so, let’s not ask this,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>What then shall we say?:</strong> The word <em>then</em> indicates a connection to previous verses. Here it introduces the question “What shall we say?” In some languages, it is more natural to have the word <em>then</em> first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then/Therefore, what shall we say?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a rhetorical question. It introduces the next question (6:1b–c). Paul did not expect the readers to answer this question. Here are other ways to translate this question:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Shall we say this?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>What then are we to say? (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is more natural to avoid this kind of question.

Here it indicates what someone might say. See the examples above.</p><h4>6:1b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Shall we continue in sin so that grace may increase?:</strong> In 5:20 Paul said that an increase in sin resulted in an abundance of grace. Someone might misunderstand Paul’s words and think that he should continue sinning in order to receive more grace from God. Here Paul referred to that thinking with this question. He showed that this thinking was clearly wrong with the words “Certainly not” in 6:2.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a rhetorical question. But Paul answered it himself in 6:2. So you should translate these words as a question here. Here are other ways to translate this question:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Is it possible that we continue to commit sin in order that God will all the more give us his grace?<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>is it good if we continue to do sin just so that this grace/mercy of God will continue to be abundant toward us?<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Tagbanwa Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul expected that his readers would agree that it is wrong for anyone to think he should continue sinning to receive more grace. In some languages indicating that this thinking is wrong must be done another way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Is it right to say that we should continue to sin so that grace might increase?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It is wrong to say that we should continue to sin so that grace might increase.</p></blockquote><h4>6:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Shall we continue in sin</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Maybe we<sup>(incl)</sup> will continually sin</p></li><li><p>we should never stop sinning</p></li><li><p>“Perhaps we <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believers</span> should continue doing evil,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>continue in sin:</strong> This phrase refers to continuing to sin, instead of trying to do the things that God wants believers to do.

There are two ways to interpret it:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It indicates that believers <u>must not</u> still live in sin. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We have died to sin; how could we go on living in it? (NJB) <em>(NJB, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It indicates that believers <u>are unable</u> to still live in sin. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>How is it possible that we who died to sin still live in it? <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, ESV, NABRE, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, REB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is difficult to decide which interpretation is best. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because 6:3–4 seems to be an exhortation to live in the new way of life as a Christian, which allows that living in sin might be possible for Christians.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Wallace (page 570) says Paul “is asking the rightness…of such a lifestyle,” but adds “even the possibility of (it).” Moo (on TW) says that interpretation (1) “appears to be closer to the truth.” A number of scholars translate as “How shall we,” which to this author implies interpretation (1), but say that to live that way is impossible (interpretation (2)).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>How can we…live in it any longer?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. It emphasizes that believers cannot or should not still live in sin. Translate this clause with that meaning. Here are some ways:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>how could we go on living in it? (NJB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is wrong to suppose/expect that we should still live in it/sin.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a command. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not suppose/expect that we should still live in it/sin.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>live in it any longer:</strong> This figure of speech speaks of sin as if it were a place to live. By living in this place, it indicates that we are controlled by sin.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages can translate this figure of speech literally and the meaning of the translation is correct. But in some languages the correct meaning must be translated in another way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>still live under sin’s influence (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>still obey/follow it</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>go on sinning (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we who died to sin:</strong> The clause <em>we who died to sin</em> refers to all believers. In some languages the word <em>who</em> would wrongly indicate that only some believers have died to sin. If that is true in your language, translate in a way that refers to all believers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We have died to sin, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so</span> how can we still live in it?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Also, the words “we have died to sin” is a true statement. Those words are not being questioned. In some languages they must be separated from the question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We have died to sin. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">So</span> how can we still live in it?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>died to sin:</strong> This figure of speech indicates that sin no longer has power over us. Some languages must change this metaphor into a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>became <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as</span> a dead person to sin</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>became <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as if</span> dead to sin <span data-bnType=\"implied\">telling us what to do</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>became <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as if</span> dead <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to the commands</span> to sin</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>sin:</strong> The singular word <em>sin</em> refers to sin as a concept. Here its power to make people sin is implied. In some languages, a different translation is necessary to make that clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>sins</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the power of</span> sin</p></blockquote>",

Jesus’ resurrection symbolizes the new life that believers can live in. The believers’ old way of life is crucified on the cross of Jesus so that they have no need to follow the desires to sin. Believers will live new lives for God and death no longer rules them, because Jesus died and was raised for them. Therefore believers should consider themselves dead to sin and do the good deeds that God wants them to do.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">they</span> might do away with the body of sin</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the body of sin might become nothing</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>(NIV:) the body of sin:</strong> The Greek word that the NIV translates as <em>body</em> refers here to the whole person.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Cranfield (page 309) and Schreiner (page 316).</span></span> It refers to all of what we are as human beings. The words <em>of sin</em> indicate that sin rules the lives of people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In many languages a literal translation would not have the correct meaning.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that the sinful body might be destroyed, <u>and</u> we might no longer be enslaved to sin (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a purpose clause would indicate that this has not happened yet. If that is true in your language, use a result clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>and also so</u> we <u>are</u> no longer enslaved to sin</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we should no longer be slaves to sin:</strong> The words <em>be slaves</em> is a metaphor. It indicates that we would no longer be like a slave to sin, obeying every sinful thought. Some languages must translate the meaning another way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we would no longer be like slaves to sin</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>no longer does sin rule us as though it were our bosses<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>be slaves to sin:</strong> The phrase <em>be slaves</em> refers to being made a slave, someone owned by another person, to do his/her will all day long. They worked for their owner/master without receiving pay, but the owner gave them food, clothing, and shelter. They had very few rights of their own.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some cultures, slaves may not be known. In other cultures, the word for slave may imply different customs than in biblical culture. If that is true in your language, here are some ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>made a person who belonged to sin</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>caused to be an owned person of sin</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>made a person who serves sin</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>made a worker/servant of sin</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The words <em>be slaves</em> is a metaphor for being completely under the rule of someone or something. Some languages may need to avoid the metaphor to make the meaning clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>made to be under the rule of sin</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>made a person lead by sin</p></blockquote>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural to put the word <em>Therefore</em> at the beginning of the sentence, as the BSB does.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>do not let sin reign:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek words here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is <u>a command to not do something</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>do not let sin reign (BSB) <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, NJB, KJV, ESV, NLT, NASB, GW, CEV, NET, NCV, NABRE)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is <u>a command to stop doing something</u>.

The figure of speech speaks of sin as a ruler/king over someone. In some languages a literal translation would have the wrong meaning or not be clear as to its meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use “like/as” to indicate the comparison. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not let sin control you like a ruler/king</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not let sin control you</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate literally and explain the meaning in a footnote. Here is an example footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This clause refers to not following/obeying the temptations of sin.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">The present tense refers to the ongoing effort of the believer to not follow the temptations of sin. Each time a believer is tempted, he must reject that temptation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Always be stopping sin from reigning/controlling you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in your mortal body:</strong> Here the word <em>body</em> implies the things someone does. The power of sin should not control what we do. In some languages a literal translation would imply that.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">But in some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer only to sins internal to the physical body. If that is true in your language, refer to what we do. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>do not let sin control <u>your life here on earth</u> (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>mortal body:</strong> The word <em>mortal</em> refers to something being able to die.

He reminded them that they were now ashamed of those sins and the consequences. The final consequence of those sins is death.

Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am using an example from everyday life (NIV11)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am now using an illustration that people can easily understand<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the weakness of your flesh:</strong> The BSB literally translates the Greek words here. Here <em>the weakness of…flesh</em> refers generally to people not always understanding things. The word <em>your</em> indicates that the believers in Rome also do not always understand things. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are weak in your natural selves (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are still weak human beings (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>according to ways of your bodies your understanding of things is weak</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you still think as people of this world <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and not as mature believers</span></p></blockquote><h4>6:19b–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Just as you used to offer the parts of your body in slavery to impurity and to escalating wickedness, so now offer them in slavery to righteousness:</strong> The phrase <em>Just as</em> introduces something to be compared. Paul compared what the believers used to do (6:19b–c) to what they must now do (6:19d–e).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages do not introduce the thing to be compared as Paul did here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you used to offer the parts of your body in slavery to impurity and to escalating wickedness, so, <u>in the same way</u>, now offer them in slavery to righteousness</p></blockquote><h4>6:19b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:19b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Just as you used to offer the parts of your body in slavery to impurity</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For just as you offered/gave parts of your body in the past to be <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like/as</span> slaves to the evil desires of the heart</p></li><li><p>Previously/Earlier you put parts of yourselves under the control of your sexual/body desires</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">The Greek of 6:19b begins with a word that is usually translated as “For” (as in the ESV). This word introduces the reason that Paul spoke in human terms because of the believers’ natural limitations (6:19a). He spoke that way because the believers had at an earlier time presented their members as slaves to impurity and lawlessness (6:19b–c). Some English versions omit this word, as the BSB does, allowing the context to imply that connection.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you used to offer:</strong> The word <em>offer</em> refers to giving something to someone for him to control. Believers used to allow themselves to be controlled by sin. See how you translated the word “present” in 6:13.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>used to:</strong> Here this phrase refers to what believers did at one time before they believed in Jesus. It does not refer to only doing something one time.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the parts of your body:</strong> Here the word <em>parts</em> refers to parts of the human body and implies deeds done with those <em>parts</em>. See how you translated <em>parts</em> in 6:13.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in slavery to impurity:</strong> Here the word <em>slavery</em> is a figure of speech. It refers to believers allowing <em>impurity</em> to rule their lives, like a master rules the lives of his slaves. See how you translated the similar phrase in 6:17 (“slaves to sin”).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>impurity:</strong> This word refers to deeds that are immoral to do. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>uncleanness (KJV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>filthy practices</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 1:24.</p><h4>6:19c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:19c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and to escalating wickedness,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and to deeds of breaking the law leading to a life of breaking the law,</p></li><li><p>and under the control of lawbreaking resulting in complete lawlessness.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and:</strong> Here this word indicates another thing to which the believers in Rome used to present their members as slaves.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to escalating wickedness:</strong> The Greek phrase is literally “to lawlessness into lawlessness.” It indicates that a person does things that ignore the law or disobeys it.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Jewett (page 420) says it refers to “the general condition which results from such acts.”</span></span> Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to lawlessness for lawlessness (NABRE)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>lawlessness for <em>a life of</em> lawlessness<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Cranfield (page 321).</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to lawlessness resulting in anarchy<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Jewett (page 413).</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other English versions add the word <em>escalating</em> or “increasing” (NIV: “ever-increasing”). But it is not clear to this author how the Greek words support that meaning.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Cranfield (page 327) and Morris speak against any meaning of “more” here.</span></span></p><h4>6:19d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:19d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so now offer them in slavery to righteousness</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so offer/give<sup>(plur)</sup> the parts of your body now to be <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like/as</span> slaves to deeds of righteousness</p></li><li><p>In the same way you must now put the parts of yourselves under the control of deeds that are right <span data-bnType=\"implied\">before God</span> to do,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so:</strong> The Greek word here introduces what is compared to the words in 6:19b–c. In some languages the word or phrase of comparison is put here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In the same way (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>now:</strong> Here this word means “at this time.” It refers to the time that Paul was writing, but can imply <em>now</em> for any reader of this verse.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>righteousness:</strong> Here this word refers to deeds and thoughts that God says are right to do or think, as in 6:18.</p><h4>6:19e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:19e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>leading to holiness.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>leading you to become more and more holy.</p></li><li><p>resulting in you becoming increasingly holy.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>leading to:</strong> The Greek word is literally “to,” as in 6:19c. Living a life of righteousness causes the person to become more and more holy. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for (NABRE)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for a life of</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>resulting in (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>holiness:</strong> There are several ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>holiness</em>. Here are the two main ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>being made holy</u> here. Every righteous deed makes believers more holy. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you will become holy (NLT) <em>(RSV, NJB, NASB, NABRE, ESV, NET, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>already having been made holy and remaining holy</u> here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>holiness (NIV) <em>(BSB, NIV, KJV, GW, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because Greek words with this particular Greek ending usually refer to a process of becoming something.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Morris (on TW), Cranfield (page 327), or Lenski (page 432).</span></span></p>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of? (NIV) <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NASB, KJV, NABRE, NET, GNT3)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It should occur <u>after the phrase</u> <u><em>at that time</em></u>.

Experiences of which you are now ashamed (NJB) <em>(NJB, NLT, GW, CEV, REB, GNT4,5)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because interpretation (2) forces the plural Greek relative pronoun to connect to the singular <em>fruit</em>, but that is not good Greek grammar.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Lenski (page 433). Schreiner (page 399) also supports interpretation (1). Other scholars support interpretation (2), but their arguments for it seem weak and their objections to interpretation (1) are easily answered. Many of the major English versions support interpretation (1). But, for this author, the main argument for interpretation (1) is to take <em>ef´</em> <em>hois</em> as meaning “about which <u>things</u>” and not connect it the singular “fruit” as interpretation (2) requires, even though <em>fruit</em> is a mass noun implying plural fruits. The word <em>fruit</em> is still technically singular in the Greek.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a rhetorical question. It emphasizes that those deeds that the believers were now ashamed of did not benefit them. Translate this clause with that meaning. Here are some ways:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>what benefit were you then deriving from the things of which you are now ashamed? (NASB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you were getting no <span data-bnType=\"implied\">good</span> fruit from the things <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you did</span> then that you are now ashamed of</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>6:21a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:21a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>What fruit did you reap at that time</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>At that time what benefits were you<sup>(plur)</sup> receiving</p></li><li><p>And certainly no good things came to you at that time</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">The Greek of 6:21a begins with a word that is usually translated as “but.” Here, it probably does not indicate contrast. Rather, it was likely used to show that Paul continued to speak about the same kinds of things as he had before this verse. Some languages will not see contrast here to 6:20. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What… (BSB, NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And what… (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>What fruit:</strong> Here the word <em>fruit</em> is a metaphor that refers to the results of people’s deeds. Paul questioned what good result could have possibly come from the things they were now ashamed of. Some languages do not use the word <em>fruit</em> to refer to the results of deeds. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>what did you gain<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>good thing/way<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kamula Back Translation, unpublished manuscript, Papua New Guinea.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>did you reap:</strong> Like harvesting fruit, this phrase asks what benefit the believers <u>received</u> from those evil deeds.

In many languages it is more natural to have this word before the question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Or, <u>brothers</u>, do you not know</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>brothers:</strong> Here the word <em>brothers</em> refers to believers in Jesus, both men and women. The word indicates a close relationship because all believers are considered spiritual children of God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>my fellow believers</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages <em>brothers</em> would be understood as literal brothers.

Here Paul explained that he knew that the believers in Rome <em>know the law</em>. Some people might think that Paul’s question here implies that he thought that the believers did not know the law. So Paul made it clear that he knew that they did know it. See also the examples in the Notes on 7:1a–b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I am speaking:</strong> Paul wrote this letter. But in effect he was talking to the believers in Rome, so he used the verb “speak” here. Also this letter would have been read aloud in the gatherings of believers in Rome, so “speak” would also be appropriate in that way. Use whatever is most natural here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>those who know the law:</strong> This phrase indicates in general that the believers in Rome know the law. It does not indicate that only some of the believers there know it. In some languages to translate the correct meaning, one must avoid using <em>who</em>.

There are several ways to interpret this word in the two places:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The word refers to <u>marrying both times</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>married another man…remarries (NLT) <em>(NIV, KJV, NASB, NLT, NET, GW, REB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The word refers to <u>adultery the first time and marrying the second time</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>lives with another man…marries another man (RSV) <em>(BSB, RSV, GNT, NIV11, CEV, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The word refers to <u>adultery both times</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>have relations with another man…has relations with another man (NJB) <em>(NJB, NABRE)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because the Greek word is unlikely to mean two different things in this verse (interpretation (2))<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Barrett, Fitzmyer, Schreiner, Witherington, Lenski, Moo, Cranfield, Dunn, and Alford all translate the Greek word in the same way both times.

But if she was sinning with another man she was not married to, she is committing adultery regardless of whether her first husband is dead or not. So it is clear that the Greek word refers to marrying in 7:3d, as it does in 7:3b. Paul was talking about the law (or covenant) of marriage in both cases, whether it stands (7:2a) or has ended (7:3c).</span></span> Also, Paul was talking about when the law of marriage is in effect, so interpretation (1) fits that discussion best.</p><h4>7:3a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:3a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So then, if she is joined to another man while her husband is still alive,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>So, if she becomes another man’s wife while her <span data-bnType=\"implied\">first</span> husband is still living,</p></li><li><p>So then, if she marries another man and her husband is still alive,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So then:</strong> This Greek phrase introduces a result.

The Louw and Nida lexicon, as well as the Liddell and Scott lexicon, also list “therefore” as a possible meaning but not “likewise.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>brothers:</strong> Here the word <em>brothers</em> refers to believers in Jesus, both men and women. The word indicates a close relationship because all believers are considered spiritual children of God. See how you translated this word in 7:1.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you also died to the law:</strong> The phrase <em>died to</em> is a figure of speech that indicates that the law no longer has any power over us. Some languages must change this metaphor into a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you have become <u>as</u> a dead person to the law</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you became <u>as if</u> dead to the Laws <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Moses</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated the words <em>died to</em> in 6:2.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you also died:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>died</em> is literally “were caused to die.” It implies that God caused believers to be like dead people to the law. They are only to follow Jesus and the Holy Spirit. So Paul used the metaphor of death to make that clear. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you also were put to death (NABRE)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> made you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as if</span> dead</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>you:</strong> Here the word <em>you</em> is emphatic in the Greek. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>as for you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>you yourselves</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>also:</strong> Here this word indicates that Paul said something more about the believers, probably connected to what he said in 7:1.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Dunn (page 361).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to the law:</strong> Here the word <em>law</em> probably refers to the law of Moses.

In this case believers already belong to another. In some languages a fulfilled purpose clause must be translated as a result clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and so you belong to another</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>belong to another:</strong> The same Greek phrase here is translated as “joined to another” (BSB) in 7:3a and “marries” in 7:3d. But it means “be to/for another” here and implies a close relationship. It does not imply marriage here as it did in 7:3. Do not translate it as “join to” or “marry” here.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>another:</strong> Here this word refers to someone other than (the power of) sin (chapter 6). It does not refer to someone other than Jesus (7:4b). In fact, 7:4d makes it clear that believers belong to Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would indicate the wrong meaning. If that is true in your language, explain the proper meaning in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>another, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">someone other than the power of sin</span></p></blockquote><h4>7:4d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:4d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to Him who was raised from the dead,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and that person is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus</span>, who was raised <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to life</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">again</span> from the dead,</p></li><li><p>You belong to the person whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> caused to leave the spirits of dead people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and be alive again</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to Him who was raised from the dead:</strong> This phrase explains who the other person (“another”) in 7:4c is.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus</span>, the one has risen from death</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus</span>, the person <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> raised from death</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>who was raised from the dead:</strong> This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> raised from the dead</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>raised from the dead:</strong> This phrase refers to God making Jesus alive again after he died and was put in the tomb.

The purpose of us belonging to Jesus is to <em>bear fruit to God</em>. In some languages the correct connection must be explained in the translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">and you</span> <sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and I belong to him</span> in order that we might bear fruit to God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we might bear fruit to God:</strong> The phrase <em>bear fruit</em> is a metaphor that means “doing good deeds that produce good results.” These good results benefit God or his kingdom.

In some languages it is not natural to speak of <em>passions</em> in that way. If that is true in your language, translate the meaning in a natural way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>our sinful passions…were <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like someone</span> working</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>our sinful desires…were causing us to be working</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the sinful passions:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>passions</em> refers to any kind of desire. Here Paul referred to only those desires that are <em>sinful</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>were at work:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>were at work</em> refers to doing something that produces the desired result. It does not imply that the <em>work</em> is difficult.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase indicates that the sinful passions worked over a period of time. Here it refers to the whole time before a believer started believing in Jesus. Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>were working</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>aroused by the law:</strong> This phrase is literally “through the law.” It indicates that the Laws of Moses helped the sinful passions to be at work in our members. The Laws of Moses pointed out what deeds were bad to do, and our sinful passions then wanted to do them. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>stirred up by the Law (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the sinful desires, <u>which the Law stirred up</u>, were at work</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>through the Laws <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Moses</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">saying what deeds were evil</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>our bodies:</strong> Here the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>bodies</em> refers to parts of the body.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">we were released</span> so that we serve</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This purpose has already begun. In some languages a result clause must be used for that meaning.

Some languages must add who is served. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we can serve God (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>serve:</strong> Here this word refers to doing things that God wants people to do. This includes worship, praying, giving tithes, helping others, and doing whatever work that God has given to that person. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>do his will</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>do the things that he commands us to do</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 1:9.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the new way:</strong> As believers, we serve God in a new way.

The laws of Moses belong to the old covenant, but Jesus has given us a new covenant. The word <em>of</em> indicates that the <em>written code</em> described that <em>old way</em> to serve God.

In this section Paul answered a possible wrong conclusion that someone might make from what he just said. Someone might think that Paul meant that the law is sinful. But Paul clearly indicated that he did not think that. The laws of Moses point out what is sin, and sin causes people to want to do the things that the law says are sin. Sinning leads to death. The laws of Moses are holy and good. But the commandments make it clear what sin is and at the same time arouse sinful passions. Those passions lead to death.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What about the Laws <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Moses</span> and sin?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s Law Reveals Our Sin (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Sin deceives us but the law is holy</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 7:7–25</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul used the word “I” in this section and 7:13–25 too. There are at least seven different ways<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Cranfield (pages 342–344).</span></span> that scholars think what Paul meant by “I” here. Here are the five main ones:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Paul was referring to himself as a Christian,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Schreiner (pages 359–364).</span></span> implying all believers think the same way and have the same struggles.</p></li><li><p>Paul, as a believer, spoke of his experience before he believed. He spoke generally enough so that other people can see that they had similar struggles.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Jewett (pages 441–444).</span></span> Paul then spoke about where we stand as believers regarding these struggles in chapter 8.</p></li><li><p>It refers generally to anyone who is not a believer but wants to be a good person by following the law. Paul used “I” to make the struggles in these verses more personal. Chapter 8 then explains the victory that believers have in contrast to the person of 7:7–25.</p></li><li><p>Paul was referring to Adam and from that all people.</p></li><li><p>Paul was referring to the history of Israel.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you use “I” in these verses.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The English versions also use “I” and do not explain it in their translations.</span></span></p></div></div><h4>7:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>What then shall we say?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ So then, should we<sup>(incl)</sup> say this:</p></li><li><p>¶ Therefore, is it right to say that</p></li><li><p>¶ And so, let’s not ask this,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>What then shall we say?:</strong> The word <em>then</em> indicates a connection to previous verses. Here it introduces the question “What shall we say?” In some languages it is more natural to have the word <em>then</em> first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then/Therefore, what shall we say?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a rhetorical question. It draws attention to what Paul said next. See how you translated this clause in 6:1.</p><h4>7:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Is the law sin?

Certainly not!:</strong> This is a rhetorical question and its answer. It emphasizes that the law is not sin. Translate these words with that meaning. Here are some ways:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question and its answer. See the examples in the notes below.</p></li><li><p>As a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Surely <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we should not say</span> that the law is sin.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We should not say</span> that the law is sin. No way!</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Is the law sin?:</strong> At the beginning of this question the words “Shall we say” are implied from 7:7a. In some languages it is natural to leave those words off, since they were just said in 7:7a. In other languages these words must be added here for a natural question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Shall we say</span> that the law is sin?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In 7:5 Paul said that the law aroused our sinful passions. Someone might misunderstand Paul’s words and then think that the law is bad. Here Paul referred to that thinking with this question. He showed that this thinking was clearly wrong with the words “By no means” after this question. Here are other ways to translate this question:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Is the law itself sinful?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>do you think that I say that God’s law is bad?<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>is it right <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to say/think</span> that the law is evil?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the law:</strong> This probably refers to the Law of Moses here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the Law (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>Moses’ laws (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Certainly not!:</strong> The Greek is literally “May it not be.” It indicates a very strong “no.” The law is not sin. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Not at all!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>By no means! (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Of course not! (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>No, indeed!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this phrase in 3:4 or 6:2. Note that “Surely” and “No way” in the <u>As a statement</u> examples in the first note of 7:7b translate the words <em>Certainly not!</em> here. If you used “Surely” or “No way” there, do not translate these words here.</p><h4>7:7c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:7c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Indeed, I would not have been mindful of sin if not for the law.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But I did not know <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what</span> sin <span data-bnType=\"implied\">was</span> except by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">hearing</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what</span> the laws <span data-bnType=\"implied\">said</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that I shouldn’t do</span>.</p></li><li><p>I only knew <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what</span> sins <span data-bnType=\"implied\">were</span> because of the laws <span data-bnType=\"implied\">saying what was wrong</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Indeed:</strong> This word indicates that in Greek “I would not have been mindful of sin if not for the law” is connected with Paul saying that the law is not sin (7:7b). In some languages this connection can be implied.

That opportunity came about because the law said “do not covet,” and Paul (and anyone for that matter) then wanted what did not belong to him. Here are other ways to translate these words:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>finding an opportunity (NABRE)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>took the opportunity (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>its opportunity:</strong> The word <em>opportunity</em> refers to a situation that someone can use to their benefit. Paul may have seen a nice house or nice clothing that belonged to someone else, and sin took that situation and tempted Paul to covet those things.

But here you should use the past tense.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>every kind of covetous desire:</strong> The phrase <em>covetous desire</em> refers to desiring to possess for oneself something that belongs to someone else, like “covet” in 7:7.

In 7:12 Paul said that the law is good. Now he asked if it is right to think that the law brought death. The answer is no. Sin brought death and this shows that sin is very bad. Paul then talked about his own struggle with sinning even though he agrees that the law is good. He felt he was captive to sin. But God can rescue us from that captivity.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">For the use of “I” in this section, see the General Comment in the summary of Section 7:7–12.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The way that Paul struggled to stop sinning</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The power of sin</p></blockquote></div><h4>7:13a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Did that which is good…become death to me? Certainly not!:</strong> This is a rhetorical question and its answer. It emphasizes that the believers in Rome should <u>not</u> think that the law, called here <em>that which is good</em>, caused Paul to be marked for death. Translate this clause with that meaning. Here are some ways:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do you think that the/that good thing become death to me?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Don’t you realize that the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">laws</span>, which/they are good, did not cause me to be marked/destined for death?</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Indeed, that which is good did not become death to me.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Surely you understand that the laws, which/they are good, did not cause me to be marked/destined for death.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a command. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not think that which is good became death to me</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Understand this: the laws, which/they are good, did not cause me to be marked/destined for death.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>that which is good:</strong> This phrase refers to God’s laws (7:12). In some languages it will be much clearer to make that explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that which is good, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">namely the laws,</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the laws, and we already said</span> that they are good</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also examples in the previous note.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>become death to me:</strong> The Greek literally translates these words. They indicate that when Paul broke the law, it became as a verdict/judgment of death for him. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>bring death to me (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>resulted in my dying (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>cause my death (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>7:13a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:13a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Did that which is good, then, become death to me?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ So then, do you think that that good thing became <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as</span> death to/for me?</p></li><li><p>¶ So, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">it is not right to say that</span> a good thing, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">namely, the law from God</span>, became <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the penalty of</span> death <span data-bnType=\"implied\">without end</span> for me.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Did that which is good, then, become death to me?:</strong> The word <em>then</em> occurs in the middle of the clause. In some languages it is more natural to be first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So then, did that which is good bring death to me?</p></blockquote><h4>7:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Certainly not!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>By no means! (ESV)</p></li><li><p>No indeed!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Certainly not!:</strong> The Greek is literally “May it not be.” It indicates a very strong “no.” The law did not bring death to Paul. See how you translated this phrase in 3:4 or 7:7. Note that “Indeed” and “Surely” in the <u>As a statement</u> examples in 7:13a–b translate the words <em>Certainly not!</em> here. If you used those words there (or something similar), do not translate these words here.</p><h4>7:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But in order that sin might be exposed as sin,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Instead, so that sin would be revealed truly as sin,</p></li><li><p>Rather, in order that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span> saw that sin was clearly sin/bad,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But:</strong> This word indicates that the law did not become death to Paul, <em>But</em> sin did. In some languages it is natural to begin this sentence with <em>But</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, 7:13b says “Certainly not!” In many languages that phrase already implies contrast and so it is more natural to omit <em>But</em> here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in order that sin might be exposed as sin:</strong> The phrase <em>in order that</em> introduces a purpose clause. In some languages a purpose clause indicates that something has not happened yet. If that is true in your language, translate this as a result clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and so sin has been shown to be sin</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sin might be exposed as sin:</strong> The phrase <em>be exposed</em> indicates that people will see that sin is clearly sin. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sin might be recognized as sin (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>its true nature as sin might be revealed (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is passive. Some languages must translate without a passive clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sin would clearly appear to be sin</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sin might reveal itself to be sin</p></blockquote><h4>7:13d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:13d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>it produced death in me through what was good,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>sin caused me to have <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a sentence/penalty of</span> death by using that good thing,</p></li><li><p>with that good thing sin produced in me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the judgment of</span> death <span data-bnType=\"implied\">without end</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it produced death in me:</strong> Here Paul continued to speak of sin as a person. Some languages cannot speak of sin in that way. If that is true in your language, you may want to make it a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>sin <span data-bnType=\"implied\">was like someone who</span> produced death in me</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>produced death in me:</strong> The word <em>produced</em> refers to causing something to exist.

In some languages, it may be more natural to omit this word and leave the connection with 7:17 implicit, as the BSB does.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>nothing good lives in me:</strong> Paul again referred to himself as a house/place inside which living things can live. The word <em>lives</em> has the same meaning as in 7:17.</p><h4>7:18b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:18b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that is, in my flesh;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>namely, in my human nature.</p></li><li><p>By that I mean: <span data-bnType=\"implied\">There is nothing good</span> inside my way of life of this world.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that is, in my flesh:</strong> The words <em>that is</em> introduce a clarification. When Paul wrote “in me” in 7:18a, he specifically meant <em>in my flesh</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>my flesh:</strong> Here the word <em>flesh</em> refers to the physical side of life. See how you translated the word <em>flesh</em> in 7:14, where the BSB translates it as “unspiritual.”</p><h4>7:18c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:18c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for I have the desire to do what is good,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For the will to do right things is available to me,</p></li><li><p>For the will to do good is ready for me to take/use,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for:</strong> This word introduces a sentence that explains “nothing good dwells in me.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I have the desire to do what is good:</strong> The Greek is literally “the to-will/desire is present with me.” This indicates that in Paul’s situation, the will or desire was available for him to take. Here are other ways to translate this Greek clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the desire to do good is in me (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the will to do what is good is in me (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the wanting to do good is present/available to me</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek words “the good” (BSB: <em>what is good</em>) appear in the next clause, but apply here as well, so many English versions move it here.</p><h4>7:18d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:18d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but I cannot carry it out.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but the power to do them is not.</p></li><li><p>but to make the effort to do it is not ready for me.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but I cannot carry it out:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is a textual issue in 7:18d: (1) Some Greek manuscripts have the word <u>not</u>, implying “cannot” (BSB, RSV, NIV, NJB, NASB, NABRE, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, REB, ESV). (2) Some Greek manuscripts have the words <u>not I find</u> (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1).</span></span> The Greek is literally “the to-work the good not.” The words “is present with me” from the Greek in 7:18c are implied here and go with “not.” This indicates that in Paul’s situation, the effort to produce good results was not available within him.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I do not do the good <span data-bnType=\"implied\">things/deeds</span> I want</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages must introduce the words <em>I want</em> with “that.” Some languages must add <em>to do</em> at the end for a natural clause, as the BSB does.

So many English versions translate it as <em>to</em> or “of.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>making me a prisoner of the law of sin (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>holding me captive:</strong> The phrase <em>holding…captive</em> is another metaphor of war. It refers to capturing enemy soldiers. Some would be killed but some would be made slaves. Here it refers to Paul being put under the law of sin. The words “another law” are implied at the beginning of this clause from 7:23a. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>making me a prisoner (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>bringing me into captivity (KJV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages must translate the metaphor of taking captives in a different way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>making me a slave</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>causing me to be like a slave</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the law of sin:</strong> Here the word <em>law</em> probably refers to a controlling principle, telling Paul, in his thinking, to do this or that. See how you translated the word <em>law</em> in 7:23b.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that dwells within me:</strong> This clause further describes “the law of sin.” It does not separate this law of sin from other laws of sin. For the correct meaning in some languages, translators must avoid the word <em>that</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the law of sin, it dwells within me</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the law of sin, and it dwells within me</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>dwells:</strong> The Greek word here is “be-ing.” It indicates that the law of sin exists in Paul’s members.

Some languages will see contrast to the question of who in that verse. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Yakan Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Other languages will need to indicate that 7:25a answers the question in 7:24b in a different way.

(2) Some Greek manuscripts have the words <u>I thank</u> (KJV). It is recommended that you follow option (1).</span></span> This clause implies that the answer to Paul’s question of “who will deliver me from this body of death” is God. In some languages a literal translation would not imply that. If that is true in your language, make that meaning explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Thanks be to God, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">it is he</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It is</span> God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who will rescue me,</span> thanks to him</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Thanks be:</strong> The BSB adds the verb <em>be</em>. This is a general thanksgiving. Paul thanked God, but the phrase allows others to join in that thanksgiving. Some languages must translate with a verb other than <em>be</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I thank God<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We should thank God<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Mengen Back Translation, unpublished manuscript, SIL PNG, Papua New Guinea.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>through Jesus Christ:</strong> Here the word <em>through</em> indicates that God will rescue Paul because of what Jesus did in his death and resurrection.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>our Lord:</strong> The word <em>Lord</em> refers to someone who has authority over people. Here it indicates that Jesus has authority over believers. See how you translated this phrase in 1:4 or 6:23.</p><h4>7:25b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:25b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So then, with my mind I serve the law of God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Therefore, in my thinking I myself am <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> a slave to the law of God,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Based on all those things, I</span> conclude that I myself obey the laws of God in my mind,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So then:</strong> Here this phrase introduces Paul’s conclusion of all that he said in 7:7–25. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Therefore (NABRE)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with my mind I serve the law of God:</strong> The phrase <em>with my mind</em> is emphasized by being in front of the verb in the Greek clause. The BSB reflects this. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I myself, with my mind, serve the law of God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to have the phrase <em>with my mind</em> after the phrase <em>the law of God</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I myself serve the law of God with my mind (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>serve the law of God:</strong> Here the word <em>serve</em> refers to doing as the law of God says. The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>serve</em> can also refer to acting like a slave to his or her master. A slave always does what the master tells him to do. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>am a slave to God’s law (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a figure of speech. In some languages it is not natural to speak of people being a slave to laws. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>am <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> a slave to God’s law</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>obey the law of God (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the law of God:</strong> See how you translated this phrase in 7:22.</p><h4>7:25c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:25c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but in my human nature I am <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> a slave to the principle of sinning.</p></li><li><p>but <span data-bnType=\"implied\">at the same time</span> I obey sinfulness in my way of life of this world.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with my flesh I serve the law of sin:</strong> The phrase <em>with my flesh</em> is emphasized by being in front of the verb in the Greek clause. In some languages it is more natural to have this phrase in its normal place. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I serve the law of sin with my flesh</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>my flesh:</strong> Here the word <em>flesh</em> refers to human nature. See how you translated this phrase in 7:18.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the law of sin:</strong> Here the word <em>law</em> again refers to a principle. Here it is the principle that sin bosses people, telling them to do evil things.

The law of Moses was not able to free people from sin (8:2). God did that. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Law of Moses cannot do this (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul spoke of <em>the law</em> as if it were a person. Some languages cannot speak of the law as doing things. If that is true in your language, translate the correct meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>For <span data-bnType=\"implied\">no one, obeying</span> the law <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Moses</span> can become free like that, because the law operates through our weak human nature. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">But</span> God condemned sin in the flesh (interpretation 1)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>For God condemned sin in the flesh. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">No one, obeying</span> the laws <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Moses</span>, is able to do that, because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> are weak <span data-bnType=\"implied\">regarding obeying them</span>. (interpretation 2)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the flesh:</strong> These words indicate that the law was unable to accomplish what God intended for it to do, because people are unable to obey it completely.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>flesh:</strong> This word refers to people living according to their natural way of thinking, the human nature. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>human nature (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>our natural inclinations</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>our old nature</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>our own desires</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 7:5 or 7:25.</p><h4>8:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful man,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He/God sent his very own Son in a body and nature that was like the normal human body</p></li><li><p>sent his own Son, and he became like <span data-bnType=\"implied\">us</span><sup>(incl)</sup> sinful people,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by sending His own Son:</strong> The word <em>by</em> here indicates that God <em>sending His own Son</em> was how God condemned sin in the flesh. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God sent his Son…. That way God condemned sin (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He sent his Child…. And that’s how God<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His own Son:</strong> This phrase is a title for Jesus. This title indicates that Jesus has the same nature and character as God. It also indicates that the relationship between God the Father and Jesus, his Son, is similar in some way to the relationship of human fathers and sons. God the Father does not have a physical body. He did not have a sexual relationship that resulted in Mary becoming pregnant and giving birth to Jesus. See how you translated the phrase “His Son” at 1:3.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the likeness of sinful man:</strong> The word <em>likeness</em> here probably indicates that Jesus became a human being yet still remained who he was before he did that,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Cranfield (page 379).</span></span> so he had all the characteristics of a human being except that he was sinless.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Morris (on TW) and Kittel (686).</span></span> But all the above information comes from many verses, not just this verse. Translate in a way that implies or allows the above meaning. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in a body like the bodies we sinners have (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to be like us sinners (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he became as sinful people<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Yongkom Back Translation, by this author, unpublished manuscript, Papua New Guinea.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is helpful to explain in the translation how Jesus is the same and different from us. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>having a human body and his customs (were) like our (incl) customs but he was not influenced/carried to sin<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Yakan Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he became a human being like us, but there was no sinfulness in him</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sinful man:</strong> The word <em>man</em> refers to the physical body here but also includes the human nature as in 8:3a. When Jesus came to earth he took on a physical body as well as human nature. In our human nature while living in this physical body that we have, it is easy for us to sin. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>our sinful nature (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>with the same human life that others use for sin (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>8:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>as an offering for sin.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and for the sake of sin,</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he sent him</span> to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">do something</span> about <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people’s</span> sins.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as an offering for sin:</strong> There are several ways to interpret the Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>as an offering for sin</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>with regard to sin</u> here. God also sent his Son to do something about sin. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and concerning sin (NET) <em>(RSV, GNT, KJV, ESV, NET, NABRE, REB, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>as a sin offering</u> here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to be a sin offering (NIV) <em>(BSB, NIV, NJB, NASB, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because this phrase is not in the context of the Old Testament system of animal sacrifice, as it is in Hebrews 13:11, where the same Greek phrase is correctly translated “sin offering.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The words here refer to taking our sins upon himself, paying the penalty for sin by his death, and setting us free from sin.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Lenski (pages 500–501) speaks of “atonement for sin and also our liberation from sin.” Fitzmyer (page 485–486) says it means “to deal with sin…or to conquer sin…or to take away…sin.”</span></span> Here are other ways to translate the Greek words according to interpretation (1):</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and for the sake of sin (NABRE)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and to deal with sin (REB)</p></blockquote><h4>8:3d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:3d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He thus condemned sin in the flesh,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and so he/God broke/ended <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the power of</span> sin in the human body,</p></li><li><p>He punished <span data-bnType=\"implied\">this thing called</span> sinning <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by ending its power</span> in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">our</span><sup>(incl)</sup> bodies.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He thus condemned sin in the flesh:</strong> In the death of Jesus on the cross, God broke the power of sin. People have the same body and human nature as Jesus. So God has broken the power of sin for all people. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he condemned <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the power of</span> sin in human nature</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God removed the power of sin to rule us people<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he really broke the control of sin over us<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Tagbanwa Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>condemned:</strong> Here this word refers to a judge saying someone is guilty and giving the punishment. Referring to condemning sin, some languages must use a different word here. See the above examples.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sin:</strong> Here <em>sin</em> is spoken of as if it were a person. Some languages must speak of sin in a different way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sinning</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the power of sin</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in the flesh:</strong> Here this phrase refers to the place where God condemned sin.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>flesh:</strong> Here this word refers to the human body.</p>",

However, some English versions omit this word and replace it with a semi-colon, as the BSB does. If this would not be natural in your language, consider translating the word “for,” as the ESV does:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for it does not submit (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>It does not submit to God’s law:</strong> The word <em>submit</em> refers to putting oneself under the leadership of someone. The mind set on the human nature will not let God’s law lead them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It refuses to place itself under the authority of God’s standards (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>It does not submit:</strong> Here the word <em>It</em> refers to “the mind of the flesh” in 8:7a.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he does not submit</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they do not submit</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>God’s law:</strong> This phrase refers to all of God’s commands, written in what is now called the Old Testament (the Hebrew Bible). In some languages the plural for <em>law</em> is more natural, since there is more than one law. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s laws</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You should <u>not</u> translate this phrase as “the laws of Moses.”</p><h4>8:7c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:7c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>nor can it do so.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because it is not even able to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">do so/that</span>.</p></li><li><p>Indeed/Hey, they are not at all able to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">let God’s rules lead them</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>nor can it do so:</strong> A more literal translation of the Greek here is “for it is not able to” or “for it is not even able to.” It indicates or emphasizes that the mind set on following the needs and desires of the body is unable to submit to God’s laws. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for it is not even able to do so (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and it never will (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because it cannot</p></blockquote>",

For that reason many English versions translate the Greek word here as <em>But</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if Christ is in you:</strong> Here the word <em>if</em> introduces a situation that is true.

Many English versions add <em>is</em>, in accord with adding “is” in 8:10a. But here the clause needs to be understood in a figurative sense, because Paul was speaking of believers who were still alive. They do not live according to human nature, so in that way their human nature (or body) is dead. Other English versions add a different word or phrase to avoid the figurative use of <em>is</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>is subject to death (NIV11)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your body will die (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>body:</strong> This word refers to the physical body of a human being. Some languages must add a possessive pronoun. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>your bodies</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because of sin:</strong> Sin leads to death (5:12 and 6:23). In some languages it is more natural to add a possessive pronoun to the word <em>sin</em>. In some languages it is more natural to make the word <em>sin</em> plural.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>gives life (NIV11)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because of righteousness:</strong> God has declared believers to be righteous (3:21).

As believers in our new life, we do not have the feeling of being oppressed, of having no say about our own life, of being required to do things that we may not want to do, and other things of the life of a slave. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you did not receive a spirit of slavery (NABRE) <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, NJB, NASB, NLT, NABRE, ESV, KJV, GW, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to the <u>Holy Spirit</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Spirit we received does not make us slaves (NCV) <em>(NIV11, GNT, CEV, REB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because it seems unlikely that the Holy Spirit would be connected to slavery with the connection of <em>of</em>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Moo (page 500) says, “In Gal. 4:1–7 the idea of slavery is specifically tied to the situation of being ‘under the law’ (see also the contrast in Heb. 12:18–24, cited by Calvin). But it may be questioned whether Paul would speak of this effect of the law as brought about by God’s Spirit, in light of the contrast between ‘letter’ and ‘Spirit’ in 7:6 and 2 Cor. 3:6–18. This makes it unlikely that ‘spirit of slavery’ refers directly to the Holy Spirit.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you did not receive:</strong> In English, <em>receive</em> indicates that someone gave, but the word “take” does not. In some languages there is only one word that means both <em>receive</em> and “take.” If your word here would indicate that God did not give the Holy Spirit but that the believers just took him, translate in a way that indicates that God gave the Spirit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> did not give to you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that returns you to fear:</strong> This phrase refers to the result of being made slaves or having the attitude of a slave.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Moo (page 500) says, “The Spirit that believers have received does not bring about ‘again’ that anxiety and fear of judgment which they suffered in their pre-Christian state (compare Gal. 4:8–10).”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">These words in the Greek are literally “again to fear.” The Holy Spirit does not cause us to be fearful. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that you live in fear again (NIV11)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and cause you to be afraid again</p></blockquote><h4>8:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but you received the Spirit of sonship,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but you received the Spirit who made you God’s adopted children.</p></li><li><p>Instead, the Spirit whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> gave to you made the way for <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> to adopt you as his children.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but you received:</strong> As in 8:15a, God gave the Holy Spirit.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Spirit of sonship:</strong> Here the word <em>of</em> indicates that the Holy Spirit causes believers to be adopted as God’s children.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Jewett (page 498) says “a Spirit producing sonship,” Witherington (page 217) says the Holy Spirit “brings sonship,” and Morris (on TW) says, “The Spirit does not make people slaves but sons.”</span></span> Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship (NIV11)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Spirit made you God’s children</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sonship:</strong> The word <em>sonship</em> refers to taking someone who is not your child and making them legally your child. Here it refers to the Holy Spirit making a believer God’s adopted child when he or she becomes a believer.

It could be just about any emotion, including being sad, desperate, happy, enthusiastic, or afraid of something. In many languages a literal translation would wrongly refer only to being in pain with tears in the eyes, or wailing. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we call out (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>say strongly</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Abba! Father:</strong> <em>Abba</em> is the word in the Aramaic language<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This was the language spoken by most of the Jews in Palestine at that time.</span></span> that means “father.” At that time it was used by both children and adults for their fathers. Here it would remind readers that Jesus used it when praying to God. So it would imply a similar relationship for believers to God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages people will not know what <em>Abba</em> means. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain its meaning in a footnote. Here is an example footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The word “Abba” means “father” in Aramaic. Jesus used this word (Mark 14:36).</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages must indicate whose father this is.

Jesus became like an Old Testament sin offering to remove the consequences of our sin. The laws of Moses demanded a righteous life, and in the Holy Spirit we can live that way.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The people who live according to the sinful nature seek to do things that are in accord with that nature. Also, they cannot please God, cannot follow his laws, are hostile to him, and will be punished with death forever. The people who live according to the Holy Spirit seek to do things that are in accord with his desire.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Christians allow the Holy Spirit to work in them. When they do that, they are as if dead to sin and God will give them life. Those without the Holy Spirit do not belong to Jesus Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">We put to death the deeds of the sinful nature. We do that by the power of the Holy Spirit. We are God’s children and can do as he does (again, by the power of the Holy Spirit). If we suffer as Jesus suffered, God will give to us his promised inheritance in heaven.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We must live according to the Holy Spirit, not according to sinfulness</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Be Ruled by the Spirit (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Living by the Power of God’s Spirit (CEV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>8:17a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:17a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And if we are children, then we are heirs:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and if we<sup>(incl)</sup> are <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his</span> children, then we are also people who will receive something in the future,</p></li><li><p>God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">has indeed adopted</span> us as his children, so he will give future things/blessings <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in heaven</span> to us.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And if we are children:</strong> Here the word “his” is implied before the word <em>children</em>. Here the word <em>if</em> introduces a situation that is true. If this first part is true, that supports the second part (“then we are heirs”) to also be true.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, using an <em>if</em>-clause would have a different meaning, or be confusing after just saying clearly that we are God’s adopted children. If that is true in your language, translate the correct meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">we are his</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">adopted</span> children, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">true?</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">So</span>…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Would you agree that</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we are his</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">adopted</span> children? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">So</span>…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">we are his</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">adopted</span> children, so…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>then we are heirs:</strong> The Greek here is more literally “also heirs.” The BSB and many English versions add the word <em>then</em> to make the connection to “if children” clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>then we are also heirs</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The word “his” is implied before the word <em>heirs</em>. In some languages it is more natural to add these implied words. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>then we are also <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his</span> heirs</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>heirs:</strong> Here this word indicates that God has chosen things for us to receive once we get to the new Jerusalem. It does not imply that God will one day die. In some languages a different word or phrase must be used for the correct meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>ones who will receive an inheritance</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people who will receive blessings/gifts <span data-bnType=\"implied\">up in the future, renewed world</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">8:17b explains that we are heirs of God.</p><h4>8:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>namely, people who will receive something from God, and Christ will share with us the things he received <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in heaven</span>,</p></li><li><p>God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">himself</span> will give them to us, and we will share in the things/blessings that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus</span> Christ received <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when he went to heaven</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ:</strong> These words further describe what kind of heirs we are.

An English idiom that is sometimes used for the Greek connecting words is “on the one hand…on the other hand.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>heirs of God:</strong> Paul here explained whose heir we are. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it is God who gives it</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the blessings/gifts that God will give</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>co-heirs with Christ:</strong> This phrase indicates that we will share in some of the things that Jesus received when he went to heaven. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus</span> Christ will share his inheritance with us</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Christ’s blessings that we will share</p></blockquote><h4>8:17c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:17c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>if indeed we suffer with Him,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>if indeed we experience hardship/pain with him,</p></li><li><p>supposing it is true that we, together with him, endure troubles/difficulties <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for his sake</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if indeed we suffer with Him:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>if indeed</em> introduces a possibility for the readers to consider and indicates emphasis. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>provided we suffer with him (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if we suffer like Jesus Christ did</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we suffer with Him:</strong> Jesus suffered, died, and went to heaven long before Paul wrote this. But Jesus lives in us (1 John 3:24), and our sufferings are connected to his sufferings (Philippians 3:10). In that way <em>we suffer with Him</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>suffer:</strong> This word refers to experiencing physical or emotional pain because of something happening to us.</p><h4>8:17d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:17d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that we may also be glorified with Him.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>with the result that we will also be given glory with him.</p></li><li><p>and then <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will also honor us and allow us to share in his/Christ’s glory/greatness/honor.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that we may also be glorified with Him:</strong> This is a result clause. This result will occur at the end of this age and is certain, like a promise, if we suffer for Jesus’ sake.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> may/will also glorify us together with him</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>be glorified with Him:</strong> These words refer to the greatness/splendor and blessings of God that he will give to us believers. The splendor and blessings are shared with Jesus. It may also refer to being highly honored. Here are other ways to translate this Greek word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>be made/allowed to share in his glory</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>we will also be included in his greatness (lit. highness)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>we (incl) will also be honored/made-great together with him<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Yakan Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated the word “glory” in 1:23 or 6:4.</p>",

It does <u>not</u> indicate that only some believers <em>have the firstfruits of the Spirit</em>. Some languages must translate with something other than <em>who</em> for the correct meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and we have the firstfruits of the Spirit</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God gave to us the firstfruits of the Spirit</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the firstfruits of the Spirit:</strong> The word <em>firstfruits</em> is often used to refer to a small portion of the first harvest of a crop. It was given as an offering to God as a way of thanking him for the whole harvest. But here it refers to something God has given believers. The Spirit is his pledge to us that we will receive the redemption of our bodies from the corruption of this world (8:23e). Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Spirit as a pledge</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the Spirit:</strong> This refers to the Holy Spirit.</p><h4>8:23c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:23c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>groan inwardly</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and we too, we groan in our hearts/insides</p></li><li><p>and indeed we also groan inside our own inner beings</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>groan inwardly:</strong> The Greek is more literally “we ourselves also groan within ourselves.” It indicates that we groan in our hearts, not out loud. The Greek word translated “we” is repeated for emphasis. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>even we ourselves groan within ourselves (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we ourselves also groan in our hearts/insides</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is not natural to repeat “we ourselves also” here.

Here are other ways to translate these words:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>at the same time that</u> we wait eagerly for adoption as sons</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>while</u> we wait eagerly for adoption as sons</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we wait eagerly:</strong> This phrase indicates that believers wait interested in our future adoption and wanting it to happen.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The same Greek word occurs in 8:19. See how you translated “waits in eager expectation” in 8:19.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>our adoption as sons:</strong> The BSB adds the words <em>as sons</em>. The word <em>adoption</em> refers to taking someone who is not your child and making them legally your child. See how you translated this phrase in 8:15, where the BSB translates it as “sonship.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a future event, unlike in 8:15. Here this is the final part of becoming God adopted children, as 8:23e explains. In some languages that will need to be made clear to avoid confusion. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the final step of</span> adoption as his/God’s children</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the last part of</span> God adopting us as his children</p></blockquote><h4>8:23e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:23e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the redemption of our bodies.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>namely, when <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will redeem our bodies.</p></li><li><p>This/That <span data-bnType=\"implied\">final step of adoption</span> is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the Spirit</span> changing our bodies <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from corruptible to incorruptible</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the redemption of our bodies:</strong> This explains what Paul meant here by “adoption as sons.” In some languages connecting words must be used to clearly indicate that connection. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">that is,</span> the redemption of our bodies</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">it is this:</span> the redemption of our bodies</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>redemption:</strong> A slave was a person who was owned by someone else. The word <em>redemption</em> refers to the act of purchasing a slave in order to set him or her free.

We hope in that redemption and that hope is based on God’s promises that now belong to the new believer.

Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> saved us</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>saved:</strong> This word refers to being rescued from something harmful or dangerous. Here it refers to God rescuing people from going to hell for their sins. See how you translated this word in 5:10.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 8:24a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages putting “in this hope” first would make the hope the basis for being saved, or another possibly wrong meaning. If that is true in your language, put that phrase in its usual place. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For we were saved in/with hope</p></blockquote></div><h4>8:24b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:24b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but hope that is seen is no hope at all.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But hope, once one/someone sees/has the thing hoped for, has ended.</p></li><li><p>If someone has already received what he was expecting, then he no longer needs to wait for it.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but:</strong> The Greek word here often introduces something that contrasts with 8:24a, as does the word <em>but</em> here. The word can also introduce something new. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages can omit this word for the correct connection.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>hope that is seen is no hope at all:</strong> This clause indicates that if we already have something we hoped for, then we are no longer hoping for it. In many languages a literal translation would not have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, translate the correct meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if it had already happened then no longer would we be waiting for it then<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if we say we are hoping, that means we have not yet received what we are hoping for<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whoever, from his hoping has seen and received it, he holds it so it is not a thing for hope<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Yongkom Back Translation, by this author, unpublished manuscript, Papua New Guinea.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If someone is waiting for anything, and has taken it already, he will not wait for it again/more/further<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Nalik Back Translation, draft, Papua New Guinea.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>that is seen:</strong> Here this word indicates that the hope is fulfilled. Some languages must use a different word to clearly indicate that meaning here. See the above examples.</p><h4>8:24c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:24c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Who hopes for what he can already see?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>If a person has already received something, why should he continue to wait for it?</p></li><li><p>Nobody waits for what he has already received.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">The Greek of 8:24c begins with the Greek word that is usually translated as “for.” Here this word introduces something that supports what Paul said in 8:24b. Some languages can omit this word for the correct connection, as the BSB does.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Who hopes for what he can already see?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. It emphasizes that no one hopes for what he already sees or has. Translate this clause with that meaning. Here are some ways:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Who hopes for what they already have? (NIV11)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Who hopes for something that he holds?

Here are the two main ones:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is <u>all things</u> that work here. <em>(NRSV, ESV, NABRE, KJV, GW, NET)</em></p></li><li><p>It is <u>God</u> who works here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in all things God works (NIV) <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). But if the major language version follows interpretation (2), you may want to follow that.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for the good of those who love Him:</strong> Here the word <em>for</em> introduces who benefits from the good. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…the good <u>of</u> those who love him (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for the good:</strong> This phrase indicates that all things that happen in a believer’s life, whether good or bad, ultimately result in benefit for him or her. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to their good (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>those who love Him:</strong> This phrase refers to all believers. Your translation should indicate or imply that meaning.</p><h4>8:28c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:28c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who are called according to His purpose.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and they are called according to his plan <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for them</span>.</p></li><li><p>He chose/appointed those people, because he planned it that way.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who are called according to His purpose:</strong> Here the word <em>who</em> introduces who benefits from the good. This group is all believers, like “those who love Him” in 8:28b. To make it clear this is the same group as in 8:28b, some languages must introduce it differently. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>namely, those who are called according to his purpose</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I refer to those who are called according to his purpose</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those who love him, <u>those who have been called in accordance with his purpose</u> (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>and</u> he called them according to his purpose</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>are called:</strong> Here the word <em>called</em> means “chosen to be given a special benefit or purpose.” God designated people in Rome to believe in Jesus and become his people. His call was the means by which he chose them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 1:6.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>according to His purpose:</strong> The word <em>purpose</em> refers to what the goal or expected result is for God calling people to believe in Jesus. There are many aspects or parts to that <em>purpose</em>. Two parts of that purpose are in 8:30: to justify and to glorify believers. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>according to his plan (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because that was his plan (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>His purpose:</strong> The BSB and many English versions add the word <em>His</em> here, because it is God’s plan to call them.</p>",

God knew us before the creation of the world (Ephesians 1:4). The word implies a complete knowledge rather than just knowing about someone. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>knew his people in advance (NLT) <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, NASB, KJV, NLT, GW, ESV, NABRE, NET, REB, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>choose before a certain time</u> here.

Here are other ways to translate this Greek word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to be like (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to share (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the image of His Son:</strong> Here the word <em>image</em> indicates that God will make us like Jesus in many ways.

In asking them he expected the believers in Rome to agree with him in these ways: God is for us and no one has greater power than him when they stand against us. God has made us right with him, so no one can accuse us of wrongdoing that God has not already forgiven. Jesus died for our sins and rose again, so no one can say we are worthy of God punishing us.

In some languages it is more natural to have the word <em>then</em> first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Therefore, what shall we say to these things?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>What…shall we say in response to these things?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question.

If this first part is true, that supports the second part (“who can be against us?”).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, using an if-clause would have a different meaning.

With God’s power we can overcome all those things.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s love for us because of Jesus Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The love of God will not abandon/leave us</p></blockquote></div><h4>8:32a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:32a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He who did not spare His own Son</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Indeed, he did not protect his own Son <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from harm</span></p></li><li><p>He even allowed his own Son to suffer,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He who did not spare His own Son:</strong> After the word <em>who</em> in the Greek is the word that means “indeed” or “even” here.

It refers to God (8:31b). The English versions add <em>He</em> for natural English.

Here this phrase indicates that God allowed Jesus to suffer and die. He did not protect him from that suffering and death. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>did not hold back <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from harm</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>did not protect</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His own Son:</strong> This phrase is emphasized in the Greek.

But some languages will not see contrast here to “not spare” here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>gave Him up:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>gave…up</em> refers to putting someone under the control of something or someone else. Here it indicates that God put Jesus under the control of men who then killed him. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>delivered Him over (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>handed him over to death (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated the similar phrases in 1:24 (“gave…over”) or 4:25 (“delivered up”).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for us all:</strong> Here the word <em>for</em> means “to benefit.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for the sake of all of us (NJB)</p></blockquote><h4>8:32c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:32c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>how will He not also, along with Him, freely give us all things?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so will he also gift/give to us all things as he gave his Son to us? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Surely/True!</span></p></li><li><p>So he will certainly give to us all things as gifts, including his Son.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>how will He not also, along with Him, freely give us all things?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question.

It emphasizes that no one will be able to condemn God’s elect, that is, declare them guilty of wrongdoing and saying how they should be punished. Translate this clause with that meaning.

(RSV) <em>(RSV, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because it parallels the question and answer in 8:33a–b.</p><h4>8:34b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:34b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For Christ Jesus, who died,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>No one. The Christ/Messiah Jesus is the person who died,</p></li><li><p>Jesus, the one/person whom God appointed to save/rescue <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span>, died.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Christ Jesus, who died:</strong> As an answer to the rhetorical question of 8:34a, this clause implies that Jesus will not condemn us. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No one. Christ Jesus who died… (NIV11)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ Jesus:</strong> There is a textual issue here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The text is <u>Christ Jesus</u>, as in the BSB. <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NABRE, NLT, ESV)</em></p></li><li><p>The text is Christ. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ (CEV) <em>(KJV, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1), because the UBS5 supports it, although they say they had difficulty in deciding. If the major language version follows option (2), you may want to follow that.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The order of the words <em>Christ Jesus</em> emphasizes that Jesus is the Christ/Messiah. However, in some languages the order <em>Christ Jesus</em> is not natural. See how you translated this phrase in 1:1 or 8:1.</p><h4>8:34c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:34c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and more than that was raised to life,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and not only that, was raised to life <span data-bnType=\"implied\">again</span>,</p></li><li><p>And another thing is that God caused him to leave the spirits of dead people and be alive <span data-bnType=\"implied\">again</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and more than that:</strong> These words indicate that Paul had more to say about Jesus here.

In asking them he expected the believers in Rome to agree with him in these ways: God is for us and no one has greater power than him when they stand against us. God has made us right with him, so no one can accuse us of wrongdoing that God has not already forgiven. Jesus died for our sins and rose again, so no one can say we are worthy of God punishing us. Nothing of this earth or of the demons and spirits can separate us from God’s love. With God’s power we can overcome all those things.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s love for us because of Jesus Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The love of God will not abandon/leave us</p></blockquote></div><h4>8:36a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:36a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>As it is written:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It is like the words written <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Scripture</span>,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">These things happen to God’s people,</span> like <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the psalm writer</span> said <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to him/God</span> in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his/God’s</span> Word/Book,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>As:</strong> Here this word indicates a comparison between experiencing any of tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, danger, or death by sword (8:35b–c) and “for Your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered” (8:36b–c). The Scripture supports Paul’s implied statement that believers experience tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, danger, and death by sword. In some languages it is more clear to make the implied statement explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We experience those/such things,</span> as</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Hardships like these are exactly what that which God caused-to-be-written is talking about which says<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We are like this written talk of God<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Yongkom Back Translation, by this author, unpublished manuscript, Papua New Guinea.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it is written:</strong> This Psalm was written more than 500 years before Paul wrote the letter to the Romans. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate the quote was written at the same time as Paul wrote here. If that is true in your language, indicate it was long before Paul wrote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it was written <span data-bnType=\"implied\">long ago</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause refers to what was written in the Old Testament. Some languages must explicitly say that to make that clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as scripture says (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it says in the Holy Book</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this phrase in 1:17 or 4:17.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In 8:36b, the word “Your” refers to God. In some languages it would be more clear to indicate to whom the writer is writing. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>someone wrote <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Scripture</span></p></blockquote><h4>8:36b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:36b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“For Your sake we face death all day long;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“We<sup>(excl)</sup> follow/obey you, and so we are being killed at all times of the day.</p></li><li><p>“Morning, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">after</span>noon, and night, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> are killing us because we are your people.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For Your sake we face death all day long:</strong> The phrase <em>For Your sake</em> is emphasized by being first in the clause. Some languages must have this phrase in its normal place. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We are being killed all the day long for your sake</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>For Your sake:</strong> This is a quote from Psalm 44:22. The writer spoke on behalf of himself and his fellow Jews. They willingly faced danger in order to stand strong for God. Paul used it here to refer to himself and his fellow believers who did the same thing. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>For you (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because we believe in you<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You should not refer explicitly to Jews or believers to explain “we” here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we face death:</strong> The Greek verb here is more literally “we are killed.” This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">others</span> are killing us</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The present tense indicates that the killing continues.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>all day long:</strong> This phrase indicates that the killers kill at any time of day (or night). Here the words <em>all day long</em> are general and refer to any day. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>at all times (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all the day (NABRE)</p></blockquote><h4>8:36c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:36c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>We are considered to be like sheep to be killed.”</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They</span> think that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they</span> can kill us like <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people kill</span> sheep.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered:</strong> There is no connecting word at the beginning of 8:36c to connect it to 8:36b, but the context implies a connection between the two. Both sentences refer to the same event: enemies of God killing his people. So languages need to make the connection explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It is also like this:</span> we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we are considered:</strong> This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">they/people</span> consider us</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sheep to be slaughtered:</strong> This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sheep for <span data-bnType=\"implied\">them</span> to slaughter</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>sheep:</strong> The animals called <em>sheep</em> are tame. They usually stay in groups. They weigh 40 to 60 kilograms. They eat plants. Here the writer of this psalm referred to <em>sheep</em> because they are easy to kill. They do not run away or fight back.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages people are not familiar with <em>sheep</em>. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Explain the word in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>animals <span data-bnType=\"implied\">called sheep</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, you may want to explain it in a footnote. Here is an example footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Sheep refers to a medium-sized tame animal. They were easy to kill.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>slaughtered:</strong> This word refers to killing animals for food. But the idea of eating is not important here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>killed (NCV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 8:36b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">These words are a quote found in Psalm 44:22.

In asking them he expected the believers in Rome to agree with him in these ways: God is for us and no one has greater power than him when they stand against us. God has made us right with him, so no one can accuse us of wrongdoing that God has not already forgiven. Jesus died for our sins and rose again, so no one can say we are worthy of God punishing us. Nothing of this earth or of the demons and spirits can separate us from God’s love. With God’s power we can overcome all those things.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s love for us because of Jesus Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The love of God will not abandon/leave us</p></blockquote></div><h4>8:39a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:39a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>or <span data-bnType=\"implied\">anything</span> high or <span data-bnType=\"implied\">anything</span> deep, or any other thing created <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by God</span></p></li><li><p>or <span data-bnType=\"implied\">whatever is</span> high above <span data-bnType=\"implied\">us</span> or <span data-bnType=\"implied\">whatever is</span> deep down below <span data-bnType=\"implied\">us</span>, or whatever thing that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has <span data-bnType=\"implied\">ever</span> made,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>height…depth:</strong> There are several ways to interpret the Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>height</em> and <em>depth</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><u>Interpret these words as relating to something connected to the literal sense of these words</u>.

Many have conjectures about astronomy, astrology, space, and other things. Schreiner (page 465) says, “The terms are spatial but should be interpreted metaphorically in light of the poetic cast of the passage (cf. Ps. 139:8–9; Eph. 3:18…). There is nothing, neither high nor low, in all the created order that can separate believers from the love of God in Christ Jesus.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">These words, <em>height</em> and <em>depth</em>, probably refers to things or beings that are high or deep (without being specific like interpretation (2) or (3)).

However, in some languages the order <em>Christ Jesus</em> is not natural. See how you translated this phrase in 8:34.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>our Lord:</strong> The word <em>Lord</em> refers to someone who has authority over people. Here it indicates that Jesus has authority over believers. See how you translated this phrase in 1:4 or 7:25.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In chapters 9–11 Paul spoke about the fact that most Jews had not accepted Jesus as their promised Messiah at that time. He explained how throughout their history God had always preserved a small portion of them as believers. He also talked about the possibility that their salvation was still close at hand in the gospel.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The fact that many did not believe did not mean that God completely rejected them. Also, it was important that the non-Jewish believers not look down on those Jews, or think too highly of themselves.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul described the unbelieving Jews as branches broken off a tree so that different branches, the non-Jewish believers, could be grafted in. But this grafting-in was all based on faith, not on any special qualities of those believers. God hardened the Jews’ hearts in part so that non-Jews would be able to come into the family. That will be true until the full number of non-Jews come in. And in that way all Israel will be saved.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this division:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The plan of God for Jews and Gentiles (Stott)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s Justice and Israel’s Future (Witherington)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Israel and the Purposes of God (Kruse)</p></blockquote>",

He was not specific about the cause of his sadness in these verses, only that God had given them many advantages as Israelites. Paul implied that they did not follow through on those advantages, and that made him sad.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The unbelief of Israel and God’s choices</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God chooses only according to his plan regarding the Jews</p></blockquote></div><h4>9:1a–2a</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 9:1 Paul strongly indicated in three different ways that he spoke truthfully in 9:2–3. By using three ways, Paul wanted the believers in Rome to be very clear that he spoke the truth in those verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I speak the truth in Christ; I am not lying, as confirmed by my conscience in the Holy Spirit. I have deep sorrow:</strong> The <em>truth</em> that Paul spoke of here is introduced with the new sentence in 9:2. In the Greek the word <em>truth</em> is first in the clause. This emphasizes it and makes it the topic. Then he said what particular truth he was thinking of in 9:2–3. The BSB uses a comma in 9:1 and a period with a new sentence in 9:2 to indicate the connection of <em>the truth</em> to 9:2–3. Here are other ways to translate this connection:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1</sup>This truth, I speak in Christ, and I am not lying, as confirmed by my conscience in the Holy Spirit, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">is</span> <sup>2</sup>that I have great sorrow</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Here is</span> a truth I speak in Christ and I am not lying <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about</span>, as confirmed by my conscience in the Holy Spirit. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">It is</span> <sup>2</sup>that I have great sorrow</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am not lying, the Holy Spirit has spoken to me in support of my thought and mind ways [conscience], and I through Christ speak this truth here. <sup>2</sup>I have in my insides great unhappiness<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Yongkom Back Translation, by this author, unpublished manuscript, Papua New Guinea.</span></span></p></blockquote><h4>9:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I speak the truth in Christ;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">This</span> truth I speak because I belong to Christ/Messiah.</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Here is</span> a truth I speak through <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus,</span> the one/person whom God appointed to save/rescue <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I speak the truth:</strong> The Greek present tense indicates that Paul wanted to reassure the believers in Rome that what he was about to say is true. The Greek present tense does not indicate that Paul would continue to speak for some time. Here is another way to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am speaking the truth (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in Christ:</strong> Here the word <em>in</em> refers to the relationship between Paul and Christ. Jesus is Paul’s lord and made him his apostle. So Paul spoke here based on that relationship and being his apostle.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase connects to the verb “speak” or to “I speak the truth” as a whole. See the examples above.</p><h4>9:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I am not lying,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I do not lie <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with what I am about to say</span>,</p></li><li><p>I do not speak/tell a lie <span data-bnType=\"implied\">here</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I am not lying:</strong> This clause also refers to the truth that Paul was about to speak in 9:2–3. It also reinforced to the believers in Rome that what he was about to say is true. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about to</span> lie</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I do not lie <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when I say it</span></p></blockquote><h4>9:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>as confirmed by my conscience in the Holy Spirit.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and my own memory also testifies through the Holy Spirit:</p></li><li><p>The Holy Spirit knows my thoughts about what I have done. He knows that I am speaking the truth. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">It is</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as confirmed by my conscience:</strong> This phrase indicates that Paul’s conscience also told him that he was not lying. The word <em>confirmed</em> is used where one is expected to tell the truth accurately. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>my conscience testifies for me (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>tells me I am not lying (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>conscience:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>conscience</em> refers to the record of past deeds that a person has in his mind. Thinking of past wrong deeds can cause him to feel ashamed or guilty. See how you translated this word in 2:15.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the Holy Spirit:</strong> Here the word <em>in</em> indicates that the Holy Spirit helped Paul’s conscience to bear truthful witness. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>through the Holy Spirit (NIV11)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>enlightened by the Holy Spirit (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Holy Spirit:</strong> This phrase refers to God’s Spirit. The word <em>Spirit</em> is used in a similar way to when a person refers to his own spirit. The word <em>Holy</em> here means “clean” or “sacred.” But it also refers to “coming from God.” See how you translated this phrase in 5:5.</p>",

It refers to some benefit for these Jews related to the possibility of Paul being cut off from Christ. Paul explained clearly in 10:1, but did not say here what he might expect from a wish to be accursed for the sake of these Jews. You may want to explain in a footnote. Here is an example footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>10:1 explains that Paul wanted very much for the Jews who do not believe in Jesus to believe in him.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for the sake of:</strong> This phrase refers to helping or causing advantage for someone.

The phrase <em>my own flesh and blood</em> explains the phrase <em>my brothers</em>, because the word <em>brothers</em> is often used to refer to fellow Christians. Connect the second phrase to the first in a way that it explains the first phrase.

The Jews and Paul all descended from Jacob, whose other name was Israel. This phrase makes it clear that Paul was talking specifically about people who were related to him by birth.

The word “who” does not imply here that only some of Paul’s “flesh and blood” are Israelites. The Greek grammar clearly indicates that all of Paul’s “flesh and blood” were Israelites.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">God gave the name Israel to Jacob. The words <em>people of</em> can also be indicated by the “-ites” ending in English. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Israelites</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If people in your language group are not familiar with the name Israel, you may want to translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. Here is an example footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Israel is another name for the Jews. God gave their ancestor Jacob the name Israel (Genesis 32:28).</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Theirs is the adoption as sons:</strong> The Greek is literally “of whom the adoption.” God made a covenant with Israel and considers them his adopted children. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>theirs the adoption (NABRE)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who were adopted as <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> children</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> adopted as his children</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they have the adoption</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they are adopted <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by God</span>, and they have</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages must translate <em>the adoption</em> with a verb.

Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>majesty</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>greatness</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages must translate this word as describing something or someone, as the BSB does. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the glory <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of God</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated the word <em>glory</em> in 1:23 or 5:2.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the covenants:</strong> The word <em>covenants</em> refers to an agreement or contract.

This verse says that Jesus the Christ is lord over all things and God blesses him forever. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who is over all, God blessed forever (NASB) <em>(NASB, NRSV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The whole phrase <u>is separate from the words “the Christ</u>.” It is a blessing to God.

But other Bible authors do and Paul probably does in Titus 2:13.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>who is God over all:</strong> These words introduce a description of Jesus the Christ (9:5b). In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are many Christs and only this one is over all. If that is true in your language, translate in a way that introduces a description of Jesus the Christ. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he is God over all</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and he is God over all</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here this phrase indicates that Jesus the Christ is lord of all things, including animals and people, and he is also God.

But 9:6b is already an explanation, so some versions translate this connection with “and.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>and</u> not all the descendants of Abraham count as his children (NJB) <em>(NJB, GNT, NLT, GW, NET, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Greek word <u>means “because” and connects “seed” to <em>children</em>, rather than back to 9:6b</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nor <u>because</u> they are his descendants are they all Abraham’s children (NIV) <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, NASB, KJV, ESV, NABRE)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1),<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Moo (page 574) says that 9:7–13 explain the basis for what Paul said in 9:6b. He translates the first two Greek words as “Neither is it the case that.” Jewett (page 575) says that 9:7a is “substantiating the claim in v. 6b.” He translates the first two Greek words as “nor [is it] that.”</span></span> because the Greek word probably has the same meaning as in 9:6 (where the BSB leaves it implicit).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Issue 2: Interpretation of what the subject of the Greek verb translated <em>are</em> is</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek verb has the ending that indicates third person plural (“they” or a group mentioned in the clause). It is not clear whether to take “they” as referring to “seed” or <em>children</em>. (In Greek, the singular “seed” can refer to either a singular seed or plural seeds, so it is grammatical for “seed” here to take the plural verb ending.) There are a number of interpretations. Here are the three main ones:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The subject is <u>children</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>nor are all the children Abraham’s true descendants (NRSV) <em>(NRSV, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The subject is <u>seed/descendants</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and not all the descendants of Abraham count as his children (NJB) <em>(GNT, NIV, NJB, KJV, NASB, NLT, REB, NABRE)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The subject is <u>all</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and not all are children of Abraham because they are his descendants (RSV) <em>(BSB, RSV, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because it fits better with 9:7b and 9:8. But you may want to follow what the major language version does here.</p><h4>9:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>On the contrary, “Through Isaac your offspring will be reckoned.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but/for <span data-bnType=\"implied\">it is as</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God said,</span> “Only Isaac’s descendants will be counted/considered as your descendants.”</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">In the Holy Book</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God told him,</span> “It is only Isaac’s descendants whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span> will name as your descendants.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>On the contrary:</strong> This indicates contrast to “all of the descendants of Abraham,” only part of 9:7a. Some languages would not consider “Through Isaac shall your offspring be named” to contrast to “not all the descendants of Abraham count as his children” (9:7a). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God told him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Just like what God said to Abraham<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Tagbanwa Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>“Through Isaac your offspring will be reckoned”:</strong> This quote is from Genesis 21:12. In some languages a quote from the Old Testament must be clearly introduced as such. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as the Scriptures say,</span> “Through Isaac your offspring will be reckoned.”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you indicate the location of quotes from the Old Testament with cross-references, you may want to do so here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Of Abraham’s children, God only chose Isaac to inherit the promises of God to Abraham. Isaac and then Jacob became the founders of the people of Israel, and God named them his people. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It is through Isaac that descendants shall bear your name (NABRE)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Isaac is the son through whom your descendants will be counted (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It is only the descendants of Isaac who will be counted as your grandchildren/descendants<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God said,</span> “Through Isaac shall <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span> reckon your offspring.”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>Through Isaac</em> is put in the front of the clause to emphasize it. In some languages, the phrase must be in its usual place. If possible emphasize it in another way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Of your (sg) children, only just the descendants of Isahak will I regard/consider your (sg) descendants<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Yakan Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The descendants I promised you will be from Isaac (NCV)</p></blockquote>",

That is, in 9:10a Paul implied that what follows is another illustration of how God’s word had not failed (9:6). The “for” connects to that implied statement and introduces an explanation.

However, the Greek NT 5 has the words of 9:12a at the beginning of 9:12. The BSB follows this guidance. If the major language translation has it there, you may want to put your translation of 9:12a there.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not by works but by Him who calls:</strong> In some languages it is more natural to have the <em>by</em> part of this phrase before the <em>not by</em> reason. And some languages will use “and” instead of <em>but</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>by him who calls and not by works</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>works:</strong> Here this word refers to actions or deeds, not things produced by a job or paid work. Here it refers to the actions or deeds of people, not God’s.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>calls:</strong> Here the word <em>calls</em> means “chooses to be given a special benefit or purpose.” God chose Jacob to begin the nation of Israel.

God spoke to her. Some languages must use an active clause here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God/he</span> told her</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause introduces a quote from Scripture. Some language translations always introduce quotes from Scripture in their translations. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">In the Holy Book,</span> she was told</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">In Scripture,</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God/he</span> told her</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The older will serve the younger:</strong> This sentence is found in Genesis 25:23. In the Hebrew culture (and many other cultures) the older sibling ruled the younger siblings. But God, to show his choice, would have the older sibling, Esau, server the younger sibling, Jacob, instead.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you indicate the location of quotes from the Old Testament with cross-references, you may want to do so here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>serve:</strong> Here this word refers to doing the work of someone else because he or she was told to do it.

It is a poetic form in Hebrew.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>have mercy</em> refers to being concerned for someone in a bad situation and helping him in some way. This includes even forgiving him for something bad he did. The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>have compassion</em> refers to being concerned or sad for someone in a bad situation. It may or may not imply helping the person.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages will have two words, one for <em>have mercy</em> and one for <em>have compassion</em>.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will have mercy/pity on whom I <span data-bnType=\"implied\">chose to</span> have mercy/pity on. Very true!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I will have mercy on whom I have mercy:</strong> This clause indicates that God chooses whom he will have mercy on.

In many languages the normal way of referring to a past event must be used. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Scripture said to Pharaoh</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Scripture says:</strong> In some languages it is not natural for a book to “say” anything. If that is true in your language, refer to God speaking and his words are found in Scripture.

In some language, this might be normal. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For this very purpose I have raised you up (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, other languages may need to place the words <em>for this very purpose</em> after <em>up</em>, as the BSB does.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I raised you up:</strong> Here the words <em>raised…up</em> refer to God causing this man to be king (Pharaoh) over the Egyptians.

The BSB omits this word. However, many English versions include it. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You will say to me then… (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In many languages this word must be first in the clause.

It emphasizes that no one is worthy enough to answer back to God. Translate this clause with that meaning. Here are some ways:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But who indeed are you, a human being, to talk back to God? (NABRE)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement.

But if the major language version follow interpretation (2), you may want to follow that.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase of address, <em>O man</em>, can refer to either a man or a woman.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But, O/you person/human, who are you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>But:</strong> The Greek word here indicates strong contrast.

The second part (<em>“Why did You make me like this?”</em>) takes the general idea of questioning the maker as found in the questions in Isaiah 29:16. It is reworded to connect more clearly to what Paul had been saying.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Dunn (page 556).</span></span> So many translations, like the BSB, do not punctuate it like a quote from Isaiah. Paul did not introduce these words with the usual introduction of a quote from Scripture, for example, “as it is written.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The BSB, the ESV, and the CEV still put in a footnote to refer to Isaiah 29:16 (and 45:9),<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Isaiah 45:9 has the molded asking questions of the molder as in 29:16, but does not have the words “Will what is molded say to its molder.” This author would recommend making the cross reference only to Isaiah 29:16.</span></span> but the NLT and the GW do not. But other translations punctuate it like a quote from the Old Testament. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>“Shall what is formed say to him who formed it, ‘Why did you make me like this?’ ” (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The NIV also references this as a quote from Isaiah 29:16 (and 45:9). See what the major language version in your area does. Or, follow the example of the BSB.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><u>Issue 2: Rhetorical question</u></p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a rhetorical question. It indicates that the created thing should not ask the one who created it, “Why have you made me like this?” It implies that people should not criticize God, who made them, asking why he made them that way. Translate this clause with that meaning. Here are some ways:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Should the thing that was created say to the one who created it, “Why have you made me like this?” (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>An object should not ask the person who made it, “Why did you make me like this?” (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Shall what is formed say to Him who formed it:</strong> This is a metaphor that is explained in 9:21. Here the words <em>what is formed</em> refers to something made of clay. The words <em>Him who formed it</em> refers to the person who forms a lump of clay into the shape he wants, specifically, in this case, God. In this metaphor the thing made of clay complains to the person who made it. The metaphor refers figuratively to a person, whom God made, who complains to God about why he made him that way. It implies that it is wrong for people to complain to God like that. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Will what is molded say to its molder (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Will what is made say to its maker (NABRE)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Should the thing that was created say to the one who created it (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Can the pot say to the potter (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is unnatural or confusing for something not alive, like a clay pot, to speak. If that is true in your language, translate the meaning without the figurative language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Can we who are just made, ask Him who made us, saying<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Western Bukidnon Manobo Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote>",

But 9:24 begins with “and whom,” which probably indicates a continuation from the “vessels of mercy” in 9:23. Some English versions end the question at the end of 9:22. But 9:23 begins with “and that,” which probably indicates that the third purpose clause continues from the two purpose clauses in 9:22. But these English versions may be just breaking up the long question into several questions and/or sentences to make it easier to read, as the NIV makes clear by repeating “what if” and adding “he did this” at the beginning of 9:23 to show the continuation.</span></span> The main part of the question is: “What if God has endured with much patience vessels of wrath?” There are three purposes introduced with the word “desiring”: (1) to show his wrath, (2) to make known his power, and (3) to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy. The phrase “prepared for destruction” describes the vessels of wrath. The words “whom He prepared in advance for glory—including us, whom He has called not only from the Jews, but also from the Gentiles” describe the vessels of mercy. Paul was not questioning these purposes and descriptions.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is more clear to have the question separate from the purposes and the long description of the vessels of mercy. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Intending to show his wrath and make his power known, what if God bore with great patience the vessels of his wrath, prepared for destruction? <sup>23</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He did that</span> in order to make the riches of his glory known to vessels of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory—<sup>24</sup>including us, whom he has called not only from the Jews, but also from the Gentiles.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What if God bore with great patience the vessels of his wrath, prepared for destruction? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">He did that because</span> he intended to show his wrath and make his power known, <sup>23</sup>and in order to make the riches of his glory known to vessels of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory—<sup>24</sup>including us, whom he has called not from the Jews, but also from the Gentiles.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>What if God…bore with great patience the vessels of His wrath, prepared for destruction…to make the riches of His glory known to the vessels of His mercy:</strong> The Greek does not have a “then” clause to go with the <em>if</em>-clause.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Moo (page 604) says, “Such a construction is not unusual in Greek (cf. LSJ, 481) and is found in the NT (Luke 19:42; John 6:62; Acts 23:9).”</span></span> So the BSB and many English versions add the word <em>What</em> to give the sentence the right meaning in English. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But suppose that God… (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a rhetorical question.

Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>made fit</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>made ready</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for destruction:</strong> The word <em>destruction</em> refers to ruining something so much as to be completely useless and not repairable. The noun <em>destruction</em> refers to an event. Some languages must use a verb for this event. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to be completely ruined</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God/him</span> to destroy</p></blockquote>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And that (KJV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you have ended 9:22 with a question mark or full stop, you should indicate that the thought from the main clause continues here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And he also wanted to…. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">As mentioned in the note on 9:22–24, this is one long question in the Greek. For example, the BSB makes 9:23–24 into a question too. But Paul was not questioning what he said in 9:23–24, so in some languages a statement would make the meaning more clear here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>23</sup>This was to make known the riches of his glory to the vessels of mercy, which he has prepared previously for glory, <sup>24</sup>namely, us whom he has called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles. (NABRE)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Note that the NABRE adds the words “This was” at the beginning of 9:23 to make the correct connection to 9:22.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the riches of His glory:</strong> Here the word <em>riches</em> refers to an abundance of God’s <em>glory</em>.

In this context it implies power, majesty, and greatness. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>majesty</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>greatness</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 3:23 or 9:4.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to:</strong> Here this Greek word indicates that God will make known his great glory <em>to</em> his people (here in this verse they are called “vessels of mercy”). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>upon vessels of mercy (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to the vessels of mercy (NABRE)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the vessels of His mercy:</strong> The word <em>vessels</em> refers to things a potter makes, as in 9:21–22. Here it is a metaphor for people upon whom God has mercy.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages the meaning of the metaphor will not be clear. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate the literal meaning and explain it in a footnote. Here is an example footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The words “vessels of His mercy” refers to people upon whom God has mercy.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate without the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>people to whom God has mercy</p></blockquote></li><li><p>You may then want to indicate what the literal words are in a footnote.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and he has prepared them beforehand</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He prepared them beforehand</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>He prepared in advance:</strong> In the metaphor of vessels, the phrase <em>in advance</em> refers to the potter making them some time before he planned to use them.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he said</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>He:</strong> Here this word refers to God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in Hosea:</strong> Here the name <em>Hosea</em> refers to the Old Testament book of Hosea.

In some languages a literal translation would imply that Hosea wrote about the same time as Paul. If that is true in your language, indicate that it was many years before Paul. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Hosea <span data-bnType=\"implied\">long ago</span></p></blockquote><h4>9:25b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">These words are from Hosea 2:23, but it is not an exact quote. However, God spoke in 9:25b–c, so quote marks are needed in English. If you indicate the location of quotes from the Old Testament with cross-references, you may want to do so here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul used these words in Hosea to imply a promise for the Gentiles. In the context of the book of Hosea, these words refer to the ten clans of Israel who had rebelled against God.

Paul answered his own question with a strong “No!” All God’s choices depend on his mercy and not on anything about the people he chooses. God made Pharaoh the way he was when he wanted the Jews to leave Egypt.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul spoke to a possible complaint about no one ultimately being able to resist God’s will. He said that complaining to God about that is futile.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">God shows his anger and power against people he has hardened. He does this to show how great his mercy is to other people. Both Jews and Gentiles are eligible to receive his mercy.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s choices/will are/is sovereign/supreme</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God chooses whom he wants for both Jews and Gentiles</p></blockquote></div><h4>9:27–28</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">These words are from Isaiah 10:22–23, but it is not an exact quote. However, Isaiah spoke in 9:27b–28b, so quote marks are needed in English. If you indicate the location of quotes from the Old Testament with cross-references, you may want to do so here.</p><h4>9:27a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:27a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Isaiah cries out concerning Israel:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And/But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">long ago</span> Isaiah called out about <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the people of</span> Israel,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The prophet</span> Isaiah said <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Scripture</span> about the Israelites,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">The Greek of 9:27a begins with a word that can be translated “and” or “but.” A number of English versions want to indicate that Paul quoted the Old Testament again, so they use “and” (ESV). It is also possible to see contrast between God speaking of only a remnant of Israel being saved and some Gentiles being called “sons of the living God.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is more natural to omit this word and allow the context to indicate the correct meaning, as the BSB does.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Isaiah cries out concerning Israel:</strong> This clause introduces an Old Testament quote that Isaiah wrote hundreds of years before Paul wrote Romans. In some languages some or all of this must be explained. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Scripture</span> Isaiah cried out about Israel <span data-bnType=\"implied\">long ago</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Isaiah:</strong> Isaiah was an Old Testament prophet, and his book has many prophecies. In some languages it is more clear for the readers to indicate that Isaiah was a prophet. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the prophet Isaiah (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>cries out:</strong> The phrase <em>cries out</em> indicates speaking strongly with urgency. In some languages a literal translation would refer only to weeping or wailing. If that is true in your language, translate the correct meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>exclaims (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>makes this proclamation (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>said loudly/urgently</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek and the BSB use the present tense here, as in 9:15. Greek scholars call it the historical present. In many languages the normal way of referring to a past event must be used, as in the last example above.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Israel:</strong> Here this word refers to the people group called <em>Israel</em>.</p><h4>9:27b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:27b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Though the number of the Israelites is like the sand of the sea,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“Even if the count of the people of Israel is as the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">count of</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the grains of</span> sand of the seashore,</p></li><li><p>“One day the Israelite people might become <span data-bnType=\"implied\">very many</span> like the number of the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">grains of</span> sand at the edges of the oceans.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Though:</strong> The form of this Greek clause expresses something that is possible but not certain. Here, in the case where the number of the people of Israel might become as much as the sand of the seashore, only a portion (the remnant) will be saved (9:27c).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the number of the Israelites is like the sand of the sea:</strong> This clause compares the number of the people of Israel to the number of grains of sand on the seashore. It is a poetic exaggeration to say “very, very many.” Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the people of Israel are as many as the grains of sand by the sea (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the people of Israel are as numerous as the grains of sand along every beach</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the number (lit. manyness) of the descendants of Israel is like the sand on the edge of the ocean<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sand of the sea:</strong> This refers to the sand on the ocean beaches around the world. See the above examples.</p><h4>9:27c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:27c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>only the remnant will be saved.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>only a portion of them will be saved.</p></li><li><p>But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will save only the remaining ones of them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>only the remnant will be saved:</strong> This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will save only the remnant</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>remnant:</strong> This word means “the portion left behind” or “the portion still remaining.” God will save only some Israelites.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>saved:</strong> This word refers to being rescued from something harmful or dangerous.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 5:10 or 8:24.</p>",

If you indicate the location of quotes from the Old Testament with cross-references, you may want to do so here.</p><h4>9:29a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:29a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>It is just as Isaiah foretold:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It is also like what Isaiah had said <span data-bnType=\"implied\">long</span> before,</p></li><li><p>Isaiah also talked <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about this/that</span> when he said <span data-bnType=\"implied\">long</span> ago <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Scripture</span>:</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">The Greek of 9:29a begins with a word that is often translated as “and.” This verse supports 9:27b–c, like 9:28 supports it. So Paul used “and” here. In some language it may be more natural to omit this word and leave the connection to 9:28 implicit, as the BSB does.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Isaiah foretold:</strong> This clause introduces words from the Old Testament. In some languages such words are clearly shown to be from there. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And as Isaiah foretold <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in God’s word</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Isaiah:</strong> If you explained in your translation that Isaiah was a prophet in 9:27, you may not need to explain it again here. For example, the CEV does not add the words “the prophet” here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>foretold:</strong> This word indicates that Isaiah spoke about something that would happen later. The Greek tense indicates that Isaiah spoke before Paul’s time and that his words are still in effect. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>had said before (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>9:29b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Unless the Lord of Hosts had left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, we would have resembled Gomorrah:</strong> The Greek grammar indicates that God had left some Israelites alive after he punished them. The unless-clause asks what might have happened if he had not left some and then answers what might have been in that case. Some languages have a special grammar or word to indicate that. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lord of only strength did not leave off with striking us <u>had-that-happened</u>, we became as Sodom and Gomora <u>had-that-happened</u><span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A more literal rendering of the Yongkom NT, Papua New Guinea, of 9:29b–c.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If the Lord Almighty did not leave us<sup>(inc)</sup> his ancestors, they <u>would have been</u> destroyed like the people of Sodom, and they would have died also like the people from Gomorrah</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">English uses <em>Unless…had</em> in the first part and <em>would have become</em> in the second part to indicate this meaning.</p><h4>9:29b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:29b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Unless the Lord of Hosts had left us descendants,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“If the Lord of Armies, on our<sup>(incl)</sup> behalf, had not allowed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">some of</span> our descendants to live,</p></li><li><p>“Had it been that the Leader/Master of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">heaven’s</span> armies did not spare some of our descendants for us,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Lord of Hosts:</strong> Here the word <em>Hosts</em> refers to armies. God has very many angels who would fight for him. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Lord of Armies (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Lord of heaven’s armies</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase implies that God is very powerful. Some English versions like the NIV have “Lord Almighty” here, but “Almighty” is a different word in the Hebrew.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>had left us descendants:</strong> This refers to God allowing some of the children of the Israelites to live. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>left us some descendants (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>If</u> the Lord of hosts had <u>not left us offspring</u> (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>kept safe for us <span data-bnType=\"implied\">some of</span> our descendants</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>descendants:</strong> The Greek here is literally “seed,” singular, but referring to plural seeds as a group. Some languages can use a literal translation for the correct meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>seed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages must use the plural and translate without the metaphor. See the examples above.</p><h4>9:29c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:29c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>we would have become like Sodom, we would have resembled Gomorrah.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>we would have become like Sodom, and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we</span> would have been made like Gomorrah.”</p></li><li><p>we would have become <span data-bnType=\"implied\">destroyed/gone</span> like <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the people of</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the city of</span> Sodom and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the city of</span> Gomorrah.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we would have become like Sodom:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB literally translates as <em>become</em> means that Israel would have resembled Sodom. God destroyed the city of Sodom and all its people (Genesis 19:1–28). Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we would have been like Sodom (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we (incl) would be like the people in the town Sodom…, all dead<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Yakan Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we would have resembled Gomorrah:</strong> The Greek is literally “and we would have been made like Gomorrah.” God also destroyed the city of Gomorrah and all its people (Genesis 19:1–28). Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and have been made like Gomorrah (NABRE)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> would have made us to be like <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the people in</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the town of</span> Gomorrah, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">also all dead</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Sodom…Gomorrah:</strong> God destroyed these two cities and all the people in them because of the great evil that they were doing. If readers of your translation are not familiar with the story in Genesis about these cities, you may want to translate literally and explain the story briefly in a footnote. Here is an example footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God destroyed the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and all the people in them because of the great evil that they were doing. See Genesis 19:1–28.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Note that this is a quote, so you may not want to add implied words to it.</p>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then/Therefore, what shall we say?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>What…will we say?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. It draws attention to what Paul said next. Paul did not expect the readers to answer this question. But he did expect the readers to agree with what he said next.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We will/should say</span> that</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it:</strong> There is no <em>the</em> before the word <em>Gentiles</em> in the Greek. Here it indicates that Paul spoke of Gentiles in general not pursuing righteousness. If possible, translate with that meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Gentiles, in general, do not pursue righteousness, but some attained it</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Gentiles do not generally/usually pursue righteousness, but some of them attained it</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Gentiles:</strong> This word refers to people who are not Jews.

These translations add the word <em>not</em> because that same word occurs in 9:31b. In some languages it is more natural, in connection with 9:31b, to add that word here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages the question word <em>Why</em> alone in a question indicates a rebuke. If that is true in your language, use a question word or sentence that does not indicate a rebuke. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>What is the reason?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>How might that be?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a rhetorical question. Paul immediately answered it himself. Some languages cannot use this word in that way. If that is true in your language, translate as a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Here is the reason: It is…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Because:</strong> Some languages do not start sentences with <em>Because</em>. If that is true in your language, repeat some or all of 9:31b or use the verb “do” instead. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They did not succeed</span> because</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They did not</span> because</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>their pursuit was not by faith:</strong> The Greek is literally just <em>not by faith</em>. Many scholars think that <em>was</em> is the correct verb to add here. Other scholars believe that the verb “pursue” is the correct verb to add.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example: Morris, Longenecker, Cranfield, Dunn, Schreiner, and Jewett.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they did not did pursue it by faith (ESV)</p></blockquote><h4>9:32b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:32b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but as if it were by works.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but they strove by means of deeds, as if it was <span data-bnType=\"implied\">possible</span>.</p></li><li><p>Instead, as is not even possible, they made deeds their basis.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but as if it were by works:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is a textual issue in 9:32b: (1) Some Greek manuscripts have the word <u>works</u> (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NABRE, ESV, NLT, GW, NET, REB, NCV). (2) Some Greek manuscripts have the words <u>works of the law</u> (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1).</span></span> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>by</em> is the same Greek word translated “by” in 9:32a. Translate it the same way here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>as if it were:</strong> Here the word <em>as</em> indicates that it is not possible to attain the goals of the law by works.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Jewett (page 610).</span></span> The BSB adds the words <em>if it were</em> to help with that meaning. Here are other ways to translate this Greek word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as though it were (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as if it was possible <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to pursue it</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>works:</strong> Here this word refers to deeds. It implies deeds that God said the Jews must do. It does not refer to the outcome of someone’s paying job. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>what they do (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>their own efforts (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>keeping the law (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>9:32c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:32c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>They stumbled over the stumbling stone,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They tripped on the stone that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> trip over.</p></li><li><p>They <span data-bnType=\"implied\">are like people who</span> stumbled over the stumbling stone.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>They stumbled over the stumbling stone:</strong> This is a figure of speech. It implies that the Jews have difficulty accepting Jesus as the Christ. But 9:33 also uses the metaphor of stumbling over a stone, so the metaphor should be kept here. But in some languages a literal translation would indicate only an actual stumbling over an actual stone, you may want to add the word “like” here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They <span data-bnType=\"implied\">are like those who</span> have stumbled over the stumbling stone</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>stumbled:</strong> The Greek is the regular past tense. This word refers to someone losing his balance when walking because he hit his foot on something and nearly fell down.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the stumbling stone:</strong> This refers to a stone that causes people to stumble.

Paul quoted what God said to the nation of Israel. See how you translated this phrase in 1:17 or 9:13.</p><h4>9:33b–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul used words from the book of Isaiah in the Old Testament (Isaiah 8:14 and 28:16). It is not an exact quote, but God spoke in 9:33b–c, so quote marks are needed in English. If you indicate the location of quotes from the Old Testament with cross-references, you may want to do so here.</p><h4>9:33b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:33b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“See, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“Look/Hey, I put in Zion a stone that causes stumbling,</p></li><li><p>“Listen/Indeed, I put <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the city</span> on <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Mount</span> Zion <span data-bnType=\"implied\">something like</span> a stone that causes <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> to stumble.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>See:</strong> This word means “look.” It emphasizes the following clause. It is not a command to look at something. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Behold (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Listen</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Hey/Indeed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling:</strong> This is a metaphor. God put a <em>stone</em> in Zion that would cause the Jews to stumble. As 9:33c makes clear, Jesus is that <em>stone</em>. Jesus came as the Christ, but many Jews rejected him as the Christ. In that way they “stumbled.” But this is a quote from the Old Testament, so nothing should be put in the translation of this clause about Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would indicate that God put an actual stone in Zion. If that is true in your language, use the word “like” here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I lay in Zion <span data-bnType=\"implied\">something like</span> a stone of stumbling</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I lay:</strong> Here the Greek word refers to putting something somewhere. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I place (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Zion:</strong> This is the name of the hill in Jerusalem southwest of the temple. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>on Sion/Zion Hill</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In the Old Testament, Mount Zion was symbolic for God’s holy city, Jerusalem. In many languages people will not know that <em>Zion</em> represents Jerusalem here. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate literally and explain its symbolic meaning in a footnote. Here are example footnotes:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>That is, Jerusalem.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Zion is symbolic for Jerusalem.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the name Jerusalem instead of <em>Zion</em> in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jerusalem (NLT) <em>You may then want a footnote to give the Greek word. Here are example footnotes:</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Literally “Zion.”</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Greek word here is Zion. Zion Hill is symbolic for Jerusalem.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>stone:</strong> This word refers to a stone large enough to stumble over.</p><h4>9:33c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:33c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and a rock of offense;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>a boulder that causes falling.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It is something like</span> a big rock that causes <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> to trip <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and fall</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek, 9:33c starts with the word that is often translated as “and.” But the stone of 9:33b and the rock of 9:33c are metaphors and refer to the same person, the Messiah.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The English versions that translate the Greek with the word “and” probably imply poetic parallelism, where two phrases refer to the same thing. The NRSV and some English versions make that clear by omitting the word “and” and inserting a comma. Another way to indicate that connection is to insert “that is.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…a stone of stumbling, <sup>33c</sup><u>that is</u>, a rock that will make them/people fall</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(NRSV:) a rock that will make them fall:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the NRSV translates as <em>make them fall</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means here <u>cause to fall or trip</u>. In this interpretation this rock refers to the same thing as the a stone of 9:33b and so the meaning here is the same or similar as “stumbling.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a stone that will make people stumble, a rock that will make them fall (GNT) <em>(RSV, NIV, GNT, NABRE, NLT, CEV, NET, NCV, REB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means here <u>cause to feel insulted or be angry</u> at something someone does or says. The Jews expected the Christ to start a revolt against the Romans instead of die on a Roman cross like a criminal. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a rock…that people trip over, a large rock that people find offensive (GW) <em>(BSB, ESV, NASB, KJV, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). But if the major language version in your area follows interpretation (2), you may want to follow that.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>a rock that will make them fall</em> is a metaphor. If you added “like” before “a stone of stumbling,” you may want to add “like” here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">something like</span> a rock that will make them fall</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">But if you added “like” before “a stone of stumbling,” you may not need to repeat “like” here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>rock:</strong> This is a different word in the Greek. It usually refers to bedrock, a large continuous rock often underneath soil and perhaps sticking out in places. Here it probably refers more generally to any large rock. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>large rock (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>boulder<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Liddell and Scott, πετρα, sense 3.</span></span></p></blockquote><h4>9:33d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:33d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and the one who believes in Him will never be put to shame.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And the one who believes in him will not be caused to be ashamed.”</p></li><li><p>But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will not shame anyone who believes in him.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and:</strong> Some languages will see “whoever believes in him” as contrasting to “I am laying in Zion a stone of stumbling.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the one who believes in Him:</strong> A person who <em>believes in</em> someone is someone who agrees to what someone stands for, trusts him, relies on him, and is committed to him. See how your translated this word in 1:16 or 6:8.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Him:</strong> This refers to the stone of stumbling and the rock of offense. But the meaning of those metaphors is the Christ. Use a pronoun that refers to a man, as the BSB does.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will never be put to shame:</strong> There are several ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>be put to shame</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It indicates that <u>someone caused them to be ashamed</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>will never be disgraced (NLT) <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, NJB, ESV, NABRE, NET, REB, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It indicates that <u>the people themselves will feel shame, without any focus on who or what caused it</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>will not be ashamed (GW) <em>(KJV, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to <u>being disappointed that things did not happen as one hoped</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>will not be disappointed (GNT) <em>(GNT, NASB, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because many scholars support it.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>No one discusses why they prefer one interpretation over the other. BDAG chooses interpretation (3), but L&amp;N, Kittel, and L&amp;S all define the word as in interpretation (1).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will not shame him</p></blockquote>",

Some Gentiles believed in Jesus and God made them righteous, but the Jews tried to obey the law of Moses to become righteous. They stumbled over who Jesus was as the Messiah, because he did not fit their ideas of what the Messiah should be.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul explained that he wanted the Jews to believe in Jesus as the Messiah. The Jews were enthusiastic to follow God, but they did not understand the right way to become righteous.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Jews followed the wrong way to become righteous</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Jews followed the Laws of Moses but did not believe in Jesus as the Christ/Messiah</p></blockquote></div><h4>10:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Brothers, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for the Israelites</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ My brothers <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and sisters</span>, the desire of my insides and the prayer <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I make</span> to God for them</p></li><li><p>¶ My fellow believers, I want deeply/greatly/truly and pray to God for my tribe/people-group</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Brothers:</strong> Here this word refers to believers in Jesus, both men and women. The word indicates a close relationship between believers because God has made them his (adopted) children. It does not refer here to his fellow Israelites who did not believe in Jesus, as in 9:3. See how you translated this word in 1:13 or 8:12.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>my heart’s desire:</strong> This phrase indicates that Paul was about to speak of something that he really wanted to happen. The word <em>heart</em> refers to the inner person, where thoughts and feelings occur. In some languages people use a different part of the body. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the desire of my insides/liver</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My real desire<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I really want that<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Western Bukidnon Manobo Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>prayer to God:</strong> Some languages must use a verb here.

(2) Some Greek manuscripts have the words <u>of-the Israel</u> (BSB, KJV, NIV, NLT, GW, NET, NCV). It is recommended that you follow option (1). The BSB, NIV, NLT, GW, NET, and NCV probably follow option (1), but explain “them” here as referring to the Jews.</span></span> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Israelites</em> is literally “them.” It refers to the Jews. Some English versions explain the word, as the BSB, perhaps because a new chapter has begun.</p><h4>10:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>is for their salvation.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>is for them to be saved.</p></li><li><p>that God will rescue them <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from the penalty of sin/wrongdoing</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>is for their salvation:</strong> The Greek is literally “for salvation.” Paul wanted his fellow Jews to believe in Jesus and therefore God would save them from going to hell for their sins. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that they may be saved (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated <em>salvation</em> in 1:16 or “saved” in 5:9 or 8:24.</p>",

The BSB leaves this connection implicit. Consider how you might introduce this kind of reason in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Because they were ignorant of God’s righteousness and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God’s righteousness:</strong> The main point here is <em>they did not submit to God’s righteousness</em>. The rest of this verse (<em>they were ignorant of God’s righteousness and sought to establish their own</em>) are reasons that contributed to not submitting.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages the connections will be more clear if the reason comes after the result.

The life of the Jews was governed by the Law which God had given them through Moses. Their obedience to it provided their understanding of being in right standing with God. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the righteousness that comes from the law (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the righteousness that is from the Laws <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Moses</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Moses writes:</strong> The verb is present tense, but Moses wrote the words of 10:5b over 1,500 years before Paul lived. Greek scholars call it the historical present. In many languages the normal way of referring to a past event must be used. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Moses wrote (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a quote from the Old Testament is always clearly introduced as one. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Moses wrote <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Scripture</span></p></blockquote><h4>10:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“The man who does these things will live by them.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“Anyone who obeys these things must live according to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all of</span> them.”</p></li><li><p>“The person doing the things the Laws command must do <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all of</span> them always.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">These words are from Leviticus 18:5.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>“The man who does these things will live by them”:</strong> The Greek of 10:5b begins with a word that is often translated as “that” (ESV). There are two ways to interpret this Greek word:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It introduces a <u>direct</u> quote here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“The man who does these things will live by them.” (BSB) <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, NRSV, NASB, NABRE, GW, CEV, NET, REB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It introduces an <u>indirect</u> quote here.

It implies Jews who want to obey God. The words <em>these things</em> do <u>not</u> refer only to the Ten Commandments. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Whoever obeys the commands of the Law (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the one who does all the Laws <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Moses</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>will live by them:</strong> This phrase probably refers to having their whole life governed by the Laws of Moses.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Lenski (page 647) says, “The only trouble with the law as a means for attaining righteousness is that it requires complete doing on our part…. ‘Shall live in (in connection with) them,’ (means that) all of them completely done.” The Greek future can imply a promise (as many scholars believe here), but it also can be an implied command (as this author and Lenski believe, and the RSV, ESV, and REB indicate with “shall,” and the NLT and CEV clearly make as a command). The English future “will” can also be an implied command. “Will live in them” is probably an implied command but it is not clear here. Only the NJB and the GW make it clearly a promise.</span></span> Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>requires obedience to all of its commands (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>must do all that the Law commands (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>by them:</strong> The word <em>them</em> refers to all of the commandments in the Law, as above.</p>",

It indicates that people who have a <em>righteousness that is by faith</em> have the attitude described in 10:6b–7b. That is, they would never think they have the power to bring Christ down to earth or to take him up to heaven. In some languages an abstract concept like <em>righteousness</em> cannot “speak.” If that is true in your language, refer to people who are righteous in this way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">people who are</span> righteous that is by faith have <span data-bnType=\"implied\">this</span> attitude:</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">people whom</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has made right <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with him</span> because they believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Jesus</span> have thinking <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like this</span>:</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the righteousness that is by faith:</strong> Here the word <em>by</em> indicates that the people who have status as righteous people, God has given that status because they believe in Jesus. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the righteousness based on faith (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the righteousness that comes from faith (NABRE)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>being made right with God through faith</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>righteousness:</strong> This word refers to being right with God. It is the same meaning as in 10:3 and 10:5.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>faith:</strong> This word refers to believing in Jesus, that he is the Christ, the one whom God sent to save people from his anger. In some languages a literal translation would refer to believing generally in anyone. If that is true in your language, indicate clearly that it refers to faith in Jesus. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>believing <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Jesus</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>says:</strong> Here the present tense indicates what is said in 10:6–7 is something a person right with God would say at any time. It is not a habitual repeating of the words over and over.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This word introduces sayings from the Old Testament. In some languages the people prefer that the translation make that clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>says <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as the Scriptures say:</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if God judges someone as being righteous by his faith, well, <u>the thinking of that person is in accord with the word of God which says</u>,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Based on the Barok Back Translation, Papua New Guinea, unpublished manuscript.</span></span></p></blockquote><h4>10:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Do not say in your heart,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“Do not ask in your insides/inner-being,</p></li><li><p>“Do not say to yourself like this:</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">This is a quote from the first part of Deuteronomy 9:4.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Do not say in your heart:</strong> Paul used this clause to introduce what he said in 10:6c. Many English versions do not put in a cross-reference to that verse, probably because it only introduces the next words. Only the NET has a cross-reference for this quote.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Do not say:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>say</em> is singular, but refers generally to anyone. In some languages the plural is used to refer generally. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Don’t you(pl) think<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Nalik Back Translation, draft, Papua New Guinea.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">10:6c is a question. In some languages “ask” would be better here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You<sup>(pl)</sup> must not ask</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in your heart:</strong> This phrase refers to the inner person. Many languages use a different organ or a more general word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in your insides/liver/stomach</p></blockquote><h4>10:6c–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>‘Who will ascend into heaven?’ (that is, to bring Christ down):</strong> Only the question is from Deuteronomy 30:12. If you indicate the location of quotes from the Old Testament with cross-references, you may want to do so here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The words <em>that is, to bring Christ down</em> explain the purpose of ascending <em>into heaven</em>. They are also not a new sentence in the Greek. That is why the BSB has the parenthesis. Here are other ways to translate this connection:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But the saving justice of faith says this: Do not think in your heart, ‘Who will go up to heaven?’—that is to bring Christ down; (NJB)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Notice that the NJB does not have a quote mark before “Do not think.” The NJB often does this.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>‘Who will ascend into heaven?,’” that is, to bring Christ down.</p></blockquote><h4>10:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>‘Who will ascend into heaven?’</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>‘Who will go up and enter heaven?’,”</p></li><li><p>‘Who will go up to heaven?’ ”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>‘Who will ascend into heaven?’:</strong> This question is a quote from part of Deuteronomy 30:12.

It emphasizes that no one should ascend to heaven (to bring Christ down to the earth). Translate with that meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Who will go up into heaven? (NABRE)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Who can go up to heaven? (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>heaven:</strong> Here the word <em>heaven</em> refers to the place where God lives.

The righteousness which comes from the Law is based on doing what the Law says. The righteousness which comes from faith is not based on what a person does but is instead a matter of the heart.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">God rescues the person who believes in Jesus and announces that Jesus is his Lord. Paul said that this is true for both Jews and people who are not Jews. Jesus is Lord of all of them. and blesses them very much.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul then asked several questions for the believers in Rome to think about. He implied that someone must be sent and preach, and people must hear, believe, and call on Jesus. Paul ended the section with a quote from the Old Testament about how it is good to preach the good news.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God saves anyone, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jew or Gentile,</span> who believes in Jesus</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Salvation by faith and the need for preaching near and far</p></blockquote></div><h4>10:9a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:9a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It is</span> that if you<sup>(sing/plur)</sup> tell others aloud that Jesus is your Lord</p></li><li><p>For if you declare to other people, “Jesus is my Leader/Master,”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that:</strong> There are several ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>that</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It <u>introduces an explanation of</u> “word of faith we are proclaiming” (10:8d). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” (NIV) <em>(BSB, NIV, NJB, NASB, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It <u>introduces more that Paul wanted to say about</u> the “word of faith we are proclaiming” (10:8d). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for (NABRE) <em>(NABRE)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It <u>introduces the reason</u> for something Paul said earlier. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because (ESV) <em>(RSV, ESV, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p><u>It is best to omit</u> this word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If you confess… (GNT) <em>(GNT, NIV11, NLT, GW, CEV, REB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because it is not clear what “because” (interpretation (3)) would connect to in earlier verses.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Cranfield and Schreiner say this verse explains something in the prior verses, which this author would think that “for” would then be best. Morris says it introduces “the content of the preaching,” which this author would think that “that” would then be best.</span></span> Interpretation (2) is possible for the Greek word and the context.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Cranfield and Witherington translate that way.</span></span> Interpretation (4) may imply the right meaning in some languages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if:</strong> Paul used <em>if</em> here to cause the Roman believers to evaluate their own lives and determine if 10:9a–b applies to them. He probably expects most or all of them to say that they are like what he said here. Consider how to translate that meaning for the word <em>if</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the Greek text, this one <em>if</em> affects both 10:9a and 10:9b. Consider how to include all of 10:9a–b in the <em>if</em>-clause in your language. Some languages may need to repeat the word <em>if</em> to make this clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>9a</sup>if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord <sup>9b</sup>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">if you</span> believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead,</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you:</strong> The Greek word is singular, but refers in general to anyone. In some languages the plural is used for that meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>confess:</strong> Here this word refers to acknowledging in front of others that you believe in Jesus as the Christ/Savior. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>declare (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>admit</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with your mouth:</strong> This phrase indicates speaking aloud. Paul probably repeated <em>your mouth</em> to connect to the same words in 10:8c. But in some languages in connection with “confess,” it may not be necessary or natural to translate this phrase. For example, the GNT omits this phrase.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>“Jesus is Lord”:</strong> In some languages, indirect speech would be more natural here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that Jesus is Lord (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause indicates that Jesus is ruler over this person’s life. See how you translated the word <em>Lord</em> in 1:4 or 9:28.</p><h4>10:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and believe in your insides/liver/stomach that God raised him from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the place of</span> the dead people,</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">if you</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">also</span> believe in your inner being that God caused him to live again after he was dead,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and believe in your heart:</strong> The words “if you” are implied from 10:9a. In some languages one or both words must be repeated here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span> believe in your heart</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">if you</span> believe in your heart</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>heart:</strong> This word refers to a person’s inner being.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>raised Him from the dead:</strong> This phrase refers to God making Jesus alive again after he died and was put in the tomb. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>raised him from death (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>brought him back to life (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this phrase in 4:24 (“raised…from the dead”) or 8:11 (“raised…from the dead”).</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 10:9a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Believing occurs before confessing. Paul probably had the order “confess with your mouth…and believe in your heart” to match the order of “in your mouth and in your heart” in 10:8c, or perhaps in a Greek poetical structure in opposite order to 10:10a–c. But in some languages it will be less confusing or more natural to have believing before confessing. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that <sup>9b</sup>if you believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead and <sup>9a</sup>confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord,</p></blockquote></div><h4>10:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>you will be saved.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>you will be rescued.</p></li><li><p>God will save you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you will be saved:</strong> This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will save you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>saved:</strong> This word refers to being rescued from something harmful or dangerous. Here it refers to God rescuing people from his anger. See how you translated this word in 5:9 or 9:27.</p>",

Paul ended the section with a quote from the Old Testament about how it is good to preach the good news.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God saves anyone, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jew or Gentile,</span> who believes in Jesus</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Salvation by faith and the need for preaching near and far</p></blockquote></div><h4>10:12a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:12a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For there is no difference between Jew and Greek:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For Jews and Greeks/Gentiles are the same <span data-bnType=\"implied\">before God</span>,</p></li><li><p>For Jews are the same as non-Jews <span data-bnType=\"implied\">regarding faith</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> This word introduces an explanation about “anyone” in 10:11b.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>there is no difference between Jew and Greek:</strong> This clause indicates that, regarding faith in Jesus and becoming God’s people, God’s promises are the same for Jews and people who are not Jews. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>there is no difference between Jews and Greeks (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jews and Greeks are the same in this regard</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Greek:</strong> This word refers to people whose native language is Greek and to others who live according to Greek ways. Here it implies everyone who is not a Jew. Paul was not leaving out anyone in this verse. So in some languages it will be more clear to use the usual translation of the word “Gentile.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Gentile (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who are Jews and <u>those who are not</u> (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You may then want to say what the literal word is and explain it here in a footnote. Here is an example footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Literally: “Greek <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span>.” But here Paul implied all people who are not Jews, because he was explaining the word “anyone” in 10:11.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you translate the word <em>Greek</em> literally, you may want to explain Paul’s meaning here in a footnote. Here is an example footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Here Paul implied all people who are not Jews, because he was explaining the word “anyone” in 10:11.</p></blockquote><h4>10:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The same Lord is Lord of all,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because the Lord is lord over all <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span>,</p></li><li><p>The Leader/Master <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus</span> is the one who rules over all <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believers</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">The Greek of 10:12b begins with a word that is often translated as “for.” This words explains what Paul said in 10:12a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because the same Lord is Lord of all (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages omitting the word “for” and implying the connection is more natural, because of the word “For” in 10:12a. The BSB follows this approach.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The same Lord is Lord of all:</strong> This clause indicates that there is only one <em>Lord</em>, and he is <em>Lord</em> over <em>all</em> people. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They all have the same Lord (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Lord is lord over everyone</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>There is just one Lord for all mankind<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Lord:</strong> The word <em>Lord</em> refers to someone who has authority over people. Many scholars think it refers to Jesus here, but the GNT adds “God” here. If possible, do not say who this <em>Lord</em> is here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages must indicate who this <em>Lord</em> is. If that is true in your language, add “Jesus,” because Paul was clearly referring to Jesus in 10:11 (“believes in him”) and called him <em>Lord</em> in 10:9.</p><h4>10:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and gives richly to all who call on Him,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and he gives generously to everyone who calls on him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for help</span>.</p></li><li><p>And he gives great gifts to all who ask him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for help</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and gives richly to all:</strong> Here the word <em>richly</em> refers to God’s generous gifts to those who believe, such as his kindness and patience (2:4), his glory (9:23) and his wisdom and knowledge (11:33). Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>enriching all who call upon him (NABRE)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and richly blesses all who call on him (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who gives generously to all who call on him (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and he gives great gifts to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the spirits/lives of</span> everyone</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>call on Him:</strong> Here the Greek grammar called “middle voice” on the verb implies asking for help.

Paul spoke of them in reverse order, probably to connect the quote of Isaiah 52:7a in Romans 10:15c to preaching at the end of his list (10:15a). In many languages the order that Paul spoke in can be translated naturally and be easily understood. In some languages it is much more natural to follow the normal order of things. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>14–15</sup>How then are they to preach unless they are sent? And how are they to hear without someone preaching?

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The people who come on foot bringing good news are beautiful</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>beautiful:</strong> This is a figure of speech.

Do not use your key term for “gospel” here if it only refers to the gospel about Jesus. In some languages, not capitalizing the term is enough (<em>good news</em> versus “Good News”) to indicate the difference. In other languages, dropping the word “the” may help indicate the difference. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>preach good news (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek can be translated literally as “announce-good-news of-good (things).” The verb “announce-good-news” here refers generally to any good news. The phrase “of-good (things)” also refers generally to any good news. Here is another way to translate these words:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>comes with a good message/news</p></blockquote>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Truly they heard<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But no.

Here in this verse of Romans, Paul did not explain or indicate the meaning. He implied those taking the gospel of Jesus. But 10:18c–d is a quote from the Old Testament, so you should not explain Paul’s implied meaning in your translation of this verse. But you may want to explain the meaning in a footnote on this verse. Here is an example footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In Psalm 19:4 the writer said that the heavens declare the glory of God even though they cannot speak. The shining of the sun, moon and stars is like a voice speaking about that glory to every part of the earth.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>message (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>talk/news</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>has gone out into all the earth:</strong> This phrase indicates that the news of the gospel has spread into places other than where it started. So it refers to the gospel being heard in places all over the earth. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>has gone throughout the earth (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>spread to the whole world<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><h4>10:18d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:18d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>their words to the ends of the world.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and their words <span data-bnType=\"implied\">have reached</span> the farthest corners of the world.”</p></li><li><p>They <span data-bnType=\"implied\">have taken it</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">even</span> to the farthest places.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>their words to the ends of the world:</strong> This phrase has a similar meaning to “Their voice has gone out to all the earth.” Hebrew poetry repeats similar meaning for emphasis. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>their words reached the ends of the earth (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>18c</sup>for “Their voice has gone out to all the earth, <sup>18d</sup>their message <span data-bnType=\"implied\">has gone out</span> to the farthest corners/places of the world</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the ends of the world:</strong> This phrase refers to the farthest places in the world. See the above examples.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 10:18c–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages repeating the same meaning is confusing or has a different meaning than emphasis.

Greek scholars call it the historical present. In many languages the normal way of referring to a past event must be used. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Moses said</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The quote is Moses speaking on God’s behalf. The words are from God. The “I” in the quote refers to God, not Moses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Moses, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for God,</span> said</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Moses, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">speaking for God,</span> said</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause introduces a quote from the Old Testament.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I myself will make you jealous</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>jealous:</strong> Here this word refers to being resentful of someone for something they have. The Jews resent that Gentiles have attained the kingdom of God (and probably that they use Hebrew Scriptures, what many Christians now call the Old Testament). The Jews think that those things belong to them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those who are not a nation:</strong> This refers to a variety of Gentiles. They come from many nations or people groups. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>people who are not even a nation (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a nation that is no nation (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a group of people who are from all over</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You should not translate this phrase with your key term for Gentiles.</p><h4>10:19c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:19c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I will make you angry by a nation without understanding.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and I will make you angry using a nation/people-group that has little understanding/sense.”</p></li><li><p>I will cause you to become angry at a nation/people-group of foolish people.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will make you angry by a nation without understanding:</strong> The Greek puts the phrase <em>by a nation without understanding</em> in the front of the clause as part of a Greek poetic form.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In this case, two parts, having similar meaning to the two previous parts, are put in reverse order.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will make you angry with/using a nation without understanding</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>without understanding:</strong> The Greek word here refers to a lack of understanding, usually implying bad morals too.

They heard the good news about Jesus as the Christ/Messiah, but many did not believe it. God made some of them jealous of God bringing many non-Jews into his kingdom, even though they were not seeking him before they heard the good news. Paul then quoted Isaiah about the Jews being disobedient and opposing God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Many Jews have rejected the gospel of Jesus</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Gentiles accept Jesus but Jews reject him</p></blockquote></div><h4>10:20a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:20a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And Isaiah boldly says:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And Isaiah boldly said <span data-bnType=\"implied\">long ago</span>,</p></li><li><p>Also <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the prophet</span> Isaiah, boldly <span data-bnType=\"implied\">wrote</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in God’s word</span> that he/God said <span data-bnType=\"implied\">this</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about the non-Jews</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And:</strong> The Greek word here is usually translated “and” or “but.” Some English versions use “Then” to indicate that Isaiah spoke after Moses (10:19b). Isaiah lived many years after the time Moses lived.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Isaiah boldly says:</strong> The Greek is literally, “Isaiah is-bold/daring and says.” God spoke the words of 10:20b–c and Isaiah wrote them in Scripture. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Isaiah is bold <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in/with</span> writing <span data-bnType=\"implied\">these words of God</span>:</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Isaiah was fearless enough to tell that the Lord had said (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">These words introduce a quote from the Old Testament. Some languages usually introduce Old Testament quotes in a certain way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the Scriptures</span> Isaiah boldly <span data-bnType=\"implied\">wrote what God</span> said</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Isaiah <span data-bnType=\"implied\">wrote in the Holy Book God</span> boldly saying this</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>says:</strong> The Greek verb is present tense <em>says</em>, but Isaiah wrote the words of 10:20b–c over seven hundred years before Paul lived. Greek scholars call it the historical present. In many languages the normal way of referring to a past event must be used. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to have said</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul introduced the quote in 10:21b with the words “as for Israel,” which implies that the quote in 10:20b–c was about the Gentiles. If you want to make explicit who Paul spoke of in this verse, you should refer to the Gentiles. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to say <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about the non-Jews</span></p></blockquote><h4>10:20b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:20b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“I was found by those who did not seek Me;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“I was discovered by people who were not seeking me,</p></li><li><p>“People were not looking for me, but <span data-bnType=\"implied\">some of</span> them found me.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">The words of 10:20b–c are from Isaiah 65:1.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I was found by those who did not seek Me:</strong> This clause is passive. Some languages must translate with an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those who did not seek me found me</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I was found:</strong> Here the word <em>found</em> indicates that people learn who the true God is. It does not imply that God was lost or hiding. Translate with that meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I was discovered</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they learned about me</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>was found:</strong> Here the word <em>was</em> indicates that in the past, at various times, people found God. Your translation should not indicate or imply that people found God all at the same time.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>those who did not seek Me:</strong> The Greek verb here refers to seeking at any time. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those not seeking me</p></blockquote><h4>10:20c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:20c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I revealed Myself to those who did not ask for Me.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">and</span> I have made myself known to people who were not asking about me.”</p></li><li><p>People were not asking <span data-bnType=\"implied\">others</span> about who I was, but I revealed that/myself to them.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I revealed Myself:</strong> There are numerous ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>revealed Myself</em>.

Then he spoke of several ways that showed that God has not rejected them. Paul spoke again of God’s grace being the basis for him choosing who will be his people. The basis is not what people do.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Then Paul explained why only some Jews have accepted Jesus as the Christ/Messiah. God caused some of them to reject Christ for his own purposes (which was so that many non-Jews would believe in Jesus (11:12)).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God has kept a remnant of Jews as his people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>At this time, in grace, God has chosen some Israelites/Jews</p></blockquote></div><h4>11:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I ask then, did God reject His people?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ So am I saying that God has abandoned/disowned his people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Israel</span>?</p></li><li><p>¶ So I ask, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Does this mean</span> that God has ended his relationship with his people, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the Jews</span>?</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I ask then:</strong> Here the word <em>then</em> introduces something someone might think based on what Paul said in 10:21 (“But as for Israel he says: ‘All day long I have held out My hands to a disobedient and obstinate people.’”). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So I ask (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In many languages the word <em>then</em> (or “so”) must be first in the clause, as in the above example.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I ask:</strong> The Greek is literally “I say,” but it is more natural in many languages to translate as <em>I ask</em>, because a question follows.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>did God reject His people?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question.

See the above examples.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His people:</strong> This phrase refers to the people of Israel (10:21).

It does not separate some of his people from other of his people. For the correct meaning in some languages, translators must avoid the word <em>whom</em>.

This question is not a rebuke. Here are some ways:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question.

The basis is not what people do.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Then Paul explained why only some Jews have accepted Jesus as the Christ/Messiah.

If you indicate the location of quotes from the Old Testament with cross-references, you may want to do so here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Lord:</strong> The word <em>Lord</em> refers to someone who has authority over people. This is a quote from the Old Testament, so this word refers to God. Do not add “Jesus” or “Jesus Christ” (as implied information) here. See how you translated this word in 4:8 or 10:16.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Your prophets:</strong> Elijah was also among the Lord God’s prophets, so in some languages it will be more clear to indicate that. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other</span> prophets of yours</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">A “prophet” is a person who speaks on behalf of God. God’s message may be in words or visions. He then tells the people God’s message. It may reveal something about a past, present, or future event, or it may reveal someone’s thoughts, motives, or attitudes. It is not like a sermon, prepared by the preacher’s study of the Bible, but God may inspire a preacher with a prophecy during a sermon. The person speaks the prophecy to the people or writes it down for their use. Here are other ways to translate the word <em>prophets</em>:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>spokespeople for you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those who speak/bring your message/words</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your message-speakers</p></blockquote></li><li><p>If the translated meaning of <em>prophets</em> is unclear, use the major language word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>porofets</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">It is good to use a general term that does not focus only on foretelling the future. Although prophets did foretell the future, they also gave people other messages from God. They especially told them to stop doing what is wrong and to obey God. See how you translated this word in 1:2.</p><h4>11:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and torn down Your altars.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and they have destroyed the altars <span data-bnType=\"implied\">where people worshiped</span> you.</p></li><li><p>They also have destroyed the platforms <span data-bnType=\"implied\">where people sacrificed to</span> you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and torn down Your altars:</strong> Although the Greek word that the BSB often translates as <em>and</em> is not in the Greek of 11:3b, many languages must have an <em>and</em> at the beginning of this clause to connect it properly to 11:3a, as the BSB does. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">and</span> they have demolished your altars</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>torn down:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>torn down</em> refers to forcefully taking something apart so it cannot be used again. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>destroyed (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>demolished (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>altars:</strong> An “altar” is a platform on which people offer sacrifices to God. Below is an artist’s idea of what the small altar at the temple in Jerusalem looked like.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If possible you should translate <em>altars</em> in a general way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the place for putting things for God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the place for burning sacrifices to honor God</p></blockquote><h4>11:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I am the only one left, and they are seeking my life as well”?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I myself am the last one alive/standing, and they seek to kill me.”</p></li><li><p>I myself am the only <span data-bnType=\"implied\">prophet</span> remaining/still alive.

But this author thinks that God could have changed to speaking of people in order to encourage Elijah if all the other prophets of God had been killed.

It indicates that these people were looking for a way to kill Elijah. Some languages must translate without the figure of speech for the correct meaning.

Paul answered this question in 11:4b–c. Some languages must translate this as a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God replied to him like/with this:</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In Greek, this is a historical present. In many languages the normal way of referring to a past event must be used, which is what the BSB does here. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>what did God say/reply to him?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the divine reply:</strong> The Greek is literally “the divine-answer.” Here it refers to the words God spoke in response to Elijah’s complaint.

For example, a farmer eats or sells most of his grain but holds back some grain for next year’s planting. Here God allowed many Israelites to worship the false god Baal, but caused some of the Israelites to remain faithful to him. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have kept for myself (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have separated out seven thousand men <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to remain</span> my people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have prevented seven thousand men <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from falling away</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and they remain faithful</span> to me</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>seven thousand men:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>men</em> usually refers to adult human males. That is probably its meaning here.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>seven thousand:</strong> Some languages do not have large numbers like <em>thousand</em>. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Use numerals.

It implies honoring that person or god and is a common action used in worship. That is the implied meaning here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>have not knelt to worship Baal (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages kneeling has a different meaning.

Then he spoke of several ways that showed that God has not rejected them. Paul spoke again of God’s grace being the basis for him choosing who will be his people. The basis is not what people do.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Then Paul explained why only some Jews have accepted Jesus as the Christ/Messiah. God caused some of them to reject Christ for his own purposes (which was so that many non-Jews would believe in Jesus (11:12)).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God has kept a remnant of Jews as his people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>At this time, in grace, God has chosen some Israelites/Jews</p></blockquote></div><h4>11:10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Their eyes must become dark/blind so they do not see,</p></li><li><p>May <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span><sup>(sing)</sup> make them <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as if</span> blind.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see:</strong> Here David asked God to make his enemies as if blind.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul applied this to a different group of people than David did.

Thus it is fruitless to inquire about what the ‘table’ might stand for, or what ‘bending the backs’ might connote.”</span></span> You should translate the meaning literally.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">But in some languages a literal translation would not imply any figurative meaning. If that is true in your language, add a general idea of the figurative meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>bend their backs <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with many difficulties/troubles</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(NET:) continually:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek words here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>continuously for an unstated amount of time</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>unceasingly (REB) <em>(GNT, NET, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>continuously for all time to come</u>.

Many scholars suggest the Greek words are an idiom that means “continuously.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example, Moo, Cranfield, Dunn, Schreiner, Jewett, Nicoll, and Fitzmyer follow interpretation (1).</span></span> The Jews who do not believe in Jesus are to have difficulties and troubles until such time that God takes away those things.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 11:9b–10b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">These words are a quote from Psalm 69:22–23.

He said that he boasted about his ministry to the non-Jews so as to make the Jews jealous of the results of his ministry among the Gentiles. Then maybe some would be curious and begin believing in Jesus. When God accepts their faith in Jesus, it will be like they rose from the dead.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul then used some metaphors to illustrate his point that God has not rejected forever the Jews who, at that time, did not believe in Jesus as the Christ. He showed that if some Jews were holy, then all were, in the same way that a part of a batch of dough represents the whole batch. And the branches of a tree that is holy are themselves holy, even if they have been broken off to allow branches from a different tree to be joined into the trunk. He used the picture of the branches of that different tree to represent the believers who were not Jews.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">He reminded the believers who were not Jews of God’s kindness toward them. He told them to always be mindful of that kindness rather than being proud of themselves. He warned them that God is able to do to them as he did to the Jews who do not believe in Jesus, if they became proud of themselves.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not look down on Jews who have not accepted Jesus as the Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Many Gentiles believing in Jesus will make the Jews want that blessing too</p></blockquote></div><h4>11:11a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:11a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I ask then, did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Therefore, I ask <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span><sup>(plur)</sup>, have they have stumbled and fallen so as to not rise again?</p></li><li><p>¶ So then, I ask <span data-bnType=\"implied\">this</span>: Those <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jews</span> have stumbled badly <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by not believing in Jesus</span>, so will they fall completely <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and be abandoned by God</span>?</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I ask then:</strong> Here the word <em>then</em> means “therefore.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question that Paul himself answered in 11:11b.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now if their sin and failure means riches for the Gentiles of this world</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now if their sin of failing <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to accept Jesus</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as the Messiah/Christ/Savior</span> means abundant blessings for the world, that is, the Gentiles</p></blockquote></div><h4>11:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>how much greater riches will their fullness bring!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>then when their fullness/inclusion occurs, the abundant <span data-bnType=\"implied\">blessings</span> will be even greater!</p></li><li><p>Therefore, God will bless them/the-non-Jews much more when the full number of Jews <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believe in Jesus</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>how much greater riches will their fullness bring:</strong> The phrase <em>how much greater</em> indicates that if the failure of the Jews produced a good result in the world, their inclusion will mean an even better result. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So the inclusion of Jewish people will make the world even richer. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So surely the world will receive much richer blessings… (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>how:</strong> Here this word strengthens the phrase “much more.” It does not make this clause a question here. See the above examples.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>fullness:</strong> The basic meaning of the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>fullness</em> is “a full measure of something.” Here are the four main ways to interpret the Greek word:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The <em>fullness</em> refers to <u>being completely included in God’s kingdom of faith in Jesus</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>full inclusion (ESV) <em>(RSV, NIV11, ESV, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The <em>fullness</em> refers to <u>the number of Jews who will believe in Jesus as many as could be</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>complete number (GNT) <em>(GNT, NABRE)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p><u>Translate in a way that allows these various interpretations</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>fullness (NIV84) <em>(BSB, NIV84, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The full-ness refers to <u>restoring the Jews to their previous position, fully accepted</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>full restoration (NET) <em>(NJB, CEV, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word can mean both interpretations (1) and (2). But many languages do not have a word that would cover both. So it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). But some languages have a word that can imply both interpretations (1) and (2). In that case you may want to follow interpretation (3). The lexicons and scholars do not support interpretation (4).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Moo, Longenecker, Cranfield, Dunn, and Schreiner translate following interpretation (3). Jewett translates following interpretation (2). Morris (page 408) says, “The meaning of <em>fullness</em> is not clear. Either the fulfilling of God’s will or the bringing in of the full number of the Jews gives good sense and marks a contrast with the situation in which Paul found himself.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>bring:</strong> The BSB adds this word for natural English, just as it adds the word “means” in 11:12a–b. Use the same word or meaning here as there.</p>",

He answered his own question, indicating that God has not. At that time many Jews rejected Jesus as the Christ/Messiah. As a result, God made the message about Jesus known to people who were not Jews. But God will one day include the Jews and save them through Jesus too.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul then spoke directly to the believers who were not Jews. He said that he boasted about his ministry to the non-Jews so as to make the Jews jealous of the results of his ministry among the Gentiles. Then maybe some would be curious and begin believing in Jesus. When God accepts their faith in Jesus, it will be like they rose from the dead.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul then used some metaphors to illustrate his point that God has not rejected forever the Jews who, at that time, did not believe in Jesus as the Christ. He showed that if some Jews were holy, then all were, in the same way that a part of a batch of dough represents the whole batch. And the branches of a tree that is holy are themselves holy, even if they have been broken off to allow branches from a different tree to be joined into the trunk. He used the picture of the branches of that different tree to represent the believers who were not Jews.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">He reminded the believers who were not Jews of God’s kindness toward them. He told them to always be mindful of that kindness rather than being proud of themselves. He warned them that God is able to do to them as he did to the Jews who do not believe in Jesus, if they became proud of themselves.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not look down on Jews who have not accepted Jesus as the Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Many Gentiles believing in Jesus will make the Jews want that blessing too</p></blockquote></div><h4>11:13a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:13a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I am speaking to you Gentiles.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Now/Look, it is to you Gentiles that I am talking/writing.</p></li><li><p>¶ You <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believers</span> who are not Jews, it is to you that I speak/write.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">The Greek of 11:13a begins with a word that is often translated as “but” and “and.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is a textual issue in 11:13a: (1) Some Greek manuscripts have the word <u>and/but</u> (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NABRE, ESV, REB, NLT, GW, NET, NCV). (2) Some later Greek manuscripts have the word <u>for</u> (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1).</span></span> The BSB has not translated this word.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am… (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I am speaking to you Gentiles:</strong> In the Greek, the word <em>you</em> is emphasized. Here are some ways to translate the emphasis:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You Gentiles, I speak to you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is to you Gentiles that I am speaking</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I am speaking:</strong> This clause refers to what Paul had been saying and what he said next. See the above examples.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>speaking:</strong> The Roman believers read this letter. So in some languages the word “writing” would be more natural here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Gentiles:</strong> Paul implied here believers who are not Jews. In some languages a literal translation would indicate or imply people who do not believe in Jesus. If that is true in your language, indicate the correct meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Gentile <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believers</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">believers who are</span> not Jews</p></blockquote><h4>11:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>So/Then, as far as I am an apostle <span data-bnType=\"implied\">whom God sent</span> to Gentiles,</p></li><li><p>Am I truly an apostle to the people who are not Jews? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yes,</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and so</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Inasmuch as:</strong> The Greek of 11:13b has a word that is often translated as “then” or “therefore” after the phrase <em>Inasmuch as</em>.

There are two ways to interpret this:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It indicates that <u>the word</u> <u><em>an</em></u> <u>should be added</u> in English. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>an apostle (ESV) <em>(RSV, GNT, NJB, NASB, ESV, GW, CEV, NET, REB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It implies that <u>the word</u> <u><em>the</em></u> <u>should be added</u> in English. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the apostle (NIV) <em>(BSB, NIV, KJV, NLT, NABRE)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because it is unlikely that Paul claimed to be the only apostle to Gentiles, as interpretation (2) implies.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>apostle:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>apostle</em> means a “representative” or “messenger.” God chose Paul and sent him to tell the gospel about Jesus. See how you translated this word in 1:1.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to the Gentiles:</strong> This phrase indicates that Paul had a ministry as an apostle with people who were not Jews.</p><h4>11:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I magnify my ministry</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I tell people about this <span data-bnType=\"implied\">great</span> work <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that God has given</span> me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to do</span>.</p></li><li><p>I praise this work of mine <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to others</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>magnify:</strong> The Greek word here is often translated “glorify.” Paul told others that his ministry is important.

If that is true in your language, translate the correct meaning.

If you can translate in a way that allows both interpretations, you may want to do so.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">A few English versions choose “someone has rejected them.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they were rejected (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God turned away from the Jews (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Many scholars support this interpretation.

Here “their trespass” leads to “riches for the world.” So some English versions add a verb like “means” (as in the ESV). You may be able to translate this as you did in 11:12.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>reconciliation:</strong> This word refers to causing two people or two groups of people, who have been enemies, to be at peace with one another. Jesus, by his death and resurrection, has made a way for people to be reconciled to God. Some languages use a phrase for this meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he made peace</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he brought us back to be God’s friends</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 5:11.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the world:</strong> This phrase implies that reconciliation with God is available to all people, and in particular to the people who are not Jews.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Moo (page 693).</span></span> It does not imply that all people will be reconciled with God.

In many languages the answer will need to be separated from the question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>what will their acceptance be? It can only be life from the dead <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for them</span>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>what will their acceptance be? It will be that they will gain life from the dead.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a rhetorical question. In some languages people will see this as a real question. If that is true in your language, translate it as a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>their acceptance will be this: life from the dead.</p></blockquote><h4>11:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>what will their acceptance be</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>what will God accepting them back into relationship with him mean?</p></li><li><p>So, what will happen when they accept <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the gospel</span>?</p></li><li><p>So, this is what will happen when they accept <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the gospel</span>:</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>acceptance:</strong> If you translated “their rejection” in 11:15a as someone rejecting them, then this word would refer to that same someone accepting them back into a relationship with him.

He answered his own question, indicating that God has not. At that time many Jews rejected Jesus as the Christ/Messiah. As a result, God made the message about Jesus known to people who were not Jews. But God will one day include the Jews and save them through Jesus too.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul then spoke directly to the believers who were not Jews. He said that he boasted about his ministry to the non-Jews so as to make the Jews jealous of the results of his ministry among the Gentiles. Then maybe some would be curious and begin believing in Jesus. When God accepts their faith in Jesus, it will be like they rose from the dead.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul then used some metaphors to illustrate his point that God has not rejected forever the Jews who, at that time, did not believe in Jesus as the Christ. He showed that if some Jews were holy, then all were, in the same way that a part of a batch of dough represents the whole batch. And the branches of a tree that is holy are themselves holy, even if they have been broken off to allow branches from a different tree to be joined into the trunk. He used the picture of the branches of that different tree to represent the believers who were not Jews.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">He reminded the believers who were not Jews of God’s kindness toward them. He told them to always be mindful of that kindness rather than being proud of themselves. He warned them that God is able to do to them as he did to the Jews who do not believe in Jesus, if they became proud of themselves.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not look down on Jews who have not accepted Jesus as the Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Many Gentiles believing in Jesus will make the Jews want that blessing too</p></blockquote></div><h4>11:16a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>If the first part of the dough is holy, so is the whole batch:</strong> This is a figure of speech.

In some languages that information needs to be added here to make the sentence clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>portion of the dough</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>holy:</strong> Here this word means “dedicated to God” or “set apart to serve God.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDAG (page 10) and L&amp;N (on TW) have “consecrated to the service of God.” This is the most likely sense here.

As a figure of speech, the Jews are set apart as God’s special people, because he made promises to them and some of those promises are in effect for the whole future of this earth.

In this figure of speech, the olive tree is God’s chosen people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Schreiner (page 604).</span></span> Before Jesus came to earth as the Christ/Messiah, God’s chosen people were the Jews and they believed in God because of their culture, history, prophecies, stories, and instruction written in their holy book, what we now call the Old Testament. Jews who do not believe in Jesus are like the branches broken off. The Gentiles who believe in Jesus are like wild olive tree branches, in that in the past they were not nurtured by God and his Word. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>being a wild olive (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>even though you are from a wild olive tree</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>wild olive shoot:</strong> Here the word <em>wild</em> refers to something that people do not usually plant and take care of. Here it is in contrast to the same kind of plant that people plant and take care of. A wild olive tree grows well but produces few olives. A cultivated olive produces many olives but is easily damaged. But the word <em>wild</em> indicates that the Gentiles did not have the same relationship with God as the Jews did, where he taught, encouraged, and corrected them. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>untamed olive tree</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>olive tree from the wilderness</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>olive:</strong> The <em>olive</em> tree produces a small oval fruit. The fruit contains oil, which was used in cooking and burned in lamps for light.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Many languages will borrow this name and spell it as the people who speak their language would say it.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>shoot:</strong> The Greek word refers to the olive tree in a general way. Normally a branch is grafted. But separating the branch from the wild olive tree is not the focus of the figure of speech here. That is probably why the BSB uses the word <em>shoot</em>. Here the word <em>shoot</em> refers to a new growth on a plant, but the fact that it is new is not important here. Use the usual word for the part of the plant that is grafted here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>branch (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>piece of a wild olive tree</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>have been grafted in:</strong> This phrase refers to taking part of one plant and connecting it to another plant so that the new piece will continue to live and grow.

He answered his own question, indicating that God has not. At that time many Jews rejected Jesus as the Christ/Messiah. As a result, God made the message about Jesus known to people who were not Jews. But God will one day include the Jews and save them through Jesus too.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul then spoke directly to the believers who were not Jews. He said that he boasted about his ministry to the non-Jews so as to make the Jews jealous of the results of his ministry among the Gentiles. Then maybe some would be curious and begin believing in Jesus. When God accepts their faith in Jesus, it will be like they rose from the dead.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul then used some metaphors to illustrate his point that God has not rejected forever the Jews who, at that time, did not believe in Jesus as the Christ. He showed that if some Jews were holy, then all were, in the same way that a part of a batch of dough represents the whole batch. And the branches of a tree that is holy are themselves holy, even if they have been broken off to allow branches from a different tree to be joined into the trunk. He used the picture of the branches of that different tree to represent the believers who were not Jews.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">He reminded the believers who were not Jews of God’s kindness toward them. He told them to always be mindful of that kindness rather than being proud of themselves. He warned them that God is able to do to them as he did to the Jews who do not believe in Jesus, if they became proud of themselves.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not look down on Jews who have not accepted Jesus as the Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Many Gentiles believing in Jesus will make the Jews want that blessing too</p></blockquote></div><h4>11:18a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:18a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>do not boast over those branches.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>then do<sup>(sing)</sup> not boast against/over the branches.</p></li><li><p>And so, you<sup>(plur)</sup> must not boast and put down the branches.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse is the then-clause (after the if-clauses of 11:17a–c).

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>do not boast against the branches (NABRE) <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, NABRE, KJV, NLT, GW, NET, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to <u>being arrogant toward someone else</u>.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You are just a branch, not the root.

This letter is addressed to the whole church in Rome. So, here the singular <em>You</em> refers to someone in a general way and does not accuse the whole church in Rome of saying what Paul quoted in 11:19b–c.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>one of you<sup>(plur)</sup></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>someone among you<sup>(plur)</sup></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will say:</strong> Paul anticipated what an incorrectly proud Gentile believer might say (a possibility), so that he could respond here in this letter.

If that is true in your language, use the one that indicates a probable future statement.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>then:</strong> The word <em>then</em> probably introduces what someone might say in response to what Paul said in 11:17–18.</p><h4>11:19b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:19b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Branches were broken off</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“<span data-bnType=\"implied\">Those</span> branches were broken off <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the tree</span></p></li><li><p>“<span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> broke off <span data-bnType=\"implied\">those</span> branches,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Branches were broken off:</strong> This clause is passive. 11:20–21 indicates that God broke them off.

He warned them that God is able to do to them as he did to the Jews who do not believe in Jesus, if they became proud of themselves.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not look down on Jews who have not accepted Jesus as the Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Many Gentiles believing in Jesus will make the Jews want that blessing too</p></blockquote></div><h4>11:21a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:21a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For if God did not spare the natural branches,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For if God did not protect the original/first branches,</p></li><li><p>because God removed some of the branches belonging to the tree,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> This word introduces a reason that a believer should fear.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if:</strong> Here the word <em>if</em> introduces a situation that is true. If this first part is true, that supports the second part (God will not spare the readers if they no longer believe in Jesus (11:20b)) to also be true.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, translating literally here would have a different meaning. If that is true in your language, translate the correct meaning.

Here this phrase indicates that God did not protect the Jews who did not believe in Jesus from the consequences of that unbelief. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>did not hold back <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from harm</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>did not protect</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 8:32.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the natural branches:</strong> This refers to the same branches as in 11:19. These branches are <em>natural</em> because they belonged to the tree. They grew from the tree. They are not the grafted-in branches.

If the readers of this letter become unbelieving like some Jews were, God will not spare these readers either. In some languages all or some of that information needs to be explicit to make the translation clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if you do not believe in Christ he will part from you<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he certainly will break you off too if you abandon (lit. drop) your belief-in/obeying-of him<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Tagbanwa Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>either:</strong> Here this word means “similarly not.” In the same way that God did not spare the Jews who did not believe, he will also not spare Gentile believers if they stop believing.</p>",

He answered his own question, indicating that God has not. At that time many Jews rejected Jesus as the Christ/Messiah. As a result, God made the message about Jesus known to people who were not Jews. But God will one day include the Jews and save them through Jesus too.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul then spoke directly to the believers who were not Jews. He said that he boasted about his ministry to the non-Jews so as to make the Jews jealous of the results of his ministry among the Gentiles. Then maybe some would be curious and begin believing in Jesus. When God accepts their faith in Jesus, it will be like they rose from the dead.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul then used some metaphors to illustrate his point that God has not rejected forever the Jews who, at that time, did not believe in Jesus as the Christ. He showed that if some Jews were holy, then all were, in the same way that a part of a batch of dough represents the whole batch. And the branches of a tree that is holy are themselves holy, even if they have been broken off to allow branches from a different tree to be joined into the trunk. He used the picture of the branches of that different tree to represent the believers who were not Jews.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">He reminded the believers who were not Jews of God’s kindness toward them. He told them to always be mindful of that kindness rather than being proud of themselves. He warned them that God is able to do to them as he did to the Jews who do not believe in Jesus, if they became proud of themselves.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not look down on Jews who have not accepted Jesus as the Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Many Gentiles believing in Jesus will make the Jews want that blessing too</p></blockquote></div><h4>11:22a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:22a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Take notice, therefore, of the kindness and severity of God:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Therefore, look/listen<sup>(sing)</sup>.

In many languages, this word must be first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then take notice</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Take notice:</strong> The Greek word is the command, “Look.” It introduces what Paul wanted the readers to pay attention to. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>See</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Listen</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Consider (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you see that (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this in 9:33 (“See”).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>kindness:</strong> This word refers to doing good to someone because you want to. The intent of <em>kindness</em> is to help the person, rather than require him to repay the <em>kindness</em> in some way. God does many good things for people. See how you translated this word in 2:4.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>severity:</strong> The Greek word refers to following a law or rule strictly. It indicates that no mercy is given. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>harshness (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God is…very strict (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>11:22b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:22b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>severity to those who fell,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He was strict to those who have fallen <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in their faith</span>,</p></li><li><p>He followed his laws/rules exactly concerning those <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jews</span> who stopped believing.</p></li><li><p>He showed no mercy to those who rejected his Christ/Messiah,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those who fell:</strong> Here Paul used the word <em>fell</em> figuratively to refer to Jews who followed the Jewish religion but did not believe Jesus was God’s Messiah (11:20b).

Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>provided (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as long as (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you continue in His kindness:</strong> This clause indicates that the Gentile believer must live according to God’s kindness to him, that is, he must continue to believe in Jesus as the Christ/Messiah.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For (KJV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Furthermore</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you will not be conceited:</strong> The word <em>brothers</em> occurs in the middle of the main clause. In many languages it is more natural to have this word first in the clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Brothers, lest you be conceited, I want you to understand this mystery,</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I do not want you to be ignorant:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB literally translates as <em>I do not want you to be ignorant</em> emphasizes what he was about to say. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I do not want you to be unaware</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>my desire is that you know</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this in 1:13.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>this mystery:</strong> This phrase refers to the words of 11:25b–26a.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>mystery:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>mystery</em> refers to truth or knowledge that people have not discovered on their own. Someone else reveals it to them. God revealed to Paul what he wrote in 11:25b–26a. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>secret (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>hidden truth</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>something that was not made-known previously<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>brothers:</strong> Here this word refers to believers in Jesus, both men and women. The word indicates a close relationship between believers because God has made them his (adopted) children. It does not refer here to his fellow Israelites who did not believe in Jesus, as in 9:3. See how you translated this word in 1:13 or 10:1.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>so that you will not be conceited:</strong> The Greek is more literally “in-order-that you might not be wise in yourselves.” This clause is a warning to the Gentile believers in Rome not to think of themselves as wise. In this letter, Paul encouraged them, that they were like branches that God had grafted into the holy tree and that Jews who have not believed in Jesus have been broken away. But here he warned them not to think that God had favored them rather than the Jews, and therefore they were wiser than the Jews. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that you will not be wise in your own estimation (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to keep you from thinking yourselves wise (REB)</p></blockquote><h4>11:25b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:25b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>A hardening in part has come to Israel,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the hearts/insides of</span> some of the Israelites have been made closed/stubborn,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has caused some of the people of Israel to be stubborn <span data-bnType=\"implied\">regarding believing in Jesus</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>A hardening in part has come to Israel:</strong> The Greek is more literally “hardness in part has happened in/to Israel.” It indicates that some Jews do not believe in Jesus, and implies that God caused that to happen. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a hardening has come upon part of Israel (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>part of Israel had its mind hardened (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the hearts of</span> some of the Israelites have been made hard/stubborn</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has caused <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the insides/mind of</span> some of the people of Israel to be hard/unyielding</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>hardening:</strong> Here this word means “stubbornness.” It refers to someone unwilling to accept something as the truth or having difficulty understanding something. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>made stubborn (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>making their minds closed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated “hardened” in 11:7.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in part:</strong> Here this word indicates that only some Jews were hardened.

The hardening of Israel in part takes place during that time period.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the full number of the Gentiles has come in:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>full number</em> means “a full measure” of something. Here the whole clause probably refers to the number of Gentiles that God has decided to bring into his kingdom. When that number is reached, the partial hardening of Israel will end. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the fullness of the Gentiles has come in (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>until all of God’s non-Jewish people are included (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>until the full number of Gentiles comes to Christ (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the Gentiles:</strong> Here this word refers to all people-groups except the Jews.

The verses he quoted were written hundreds of years before Paul wrote the letter to the Romans.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as it was written <span data-bnType=\"implied\">long ago</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause refers to what was written in the Old Testament. Some languages must make that explicit to make that clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>As scripture says (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is passive. The prophet wrote what God told him to write. Some languages must use an active clause here.

Here are other ways to translate this title:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Savior (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The one who rescues (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Since this is an Old Testament quote, you should not name Jesus here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Zion:</strong> <em>Zion</em> is the name of the hill in Jerusalem southwest of the temple. In the Old Testament, Mount Zion was symbolic for God’s holy city, Jerusalem.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s riches and wisdom and knowledge are deep indeed!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s riches and wisdom and knowledge are very truly deep!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God:</strong> There are two issues:</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><u>Issue 1: Interpretation</u></p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are two ways to interpret this Greek phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>There are <u><em>three things</em></u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the depth of the riches <u>and</u> wisdom and knowledge of God (NABRE) <em>(RSV, GNT, NABRE, NLT, ESV, GW, CEV, NET, REB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>There are <u>two things</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the depth of the riches <u>of</u> the wisdom and knowledge of God (NIV) <em>(BSB, NIV, NASB, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because many scholars have a strong case for it.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Moo (page 740) in support of interpretation (1) says, “But, recognizing that πλούτος (“riches”) is used absolutely already in Rom. 11 (v. 11), it makes better sense to view πλούτου (“riches”), σοφίας (“wisdom”), and γνώσεως (“knowledge”) as coordinate, each dependent on the word βάθος (“depth”).”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><u>Issue 2: Clause structure</u></p><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause does not have a verb. Some languages must have a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s riches and wisdom and knowledge <u>are</u> deep indeed!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Also, the word <em>depth</em> applies to each of <em>the riches</em>, <em>the wisdom</em>, and <em>knowledge of God</em>. Some languages must repeat the word for each of the three for the correct meaning or repeat the meaning of <em>of God</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the depth of God’s riches and the depth of his wisdom and the depth of his knowledge</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">And some languages must use different words for the large amount of each. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>How great are God’s riches! How deep are his wisdom and knowledge! (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the depth of God’s riches and the height of his wisdom and the width of his knowledge</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>depth:</strong> This word indicates that God’s riches, wisdom, and knowledge are very great. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>is very great</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>abundance</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>riches:</strong> This word refers to the good and great things that God has. He has an endless supply. This word does not refer to money. In some languages a literal translation would refer only to money. If that is true in your language, translate the correct meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>very many good things</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>great <span data-bnType=\"implied\">heavenly/spiritual</span> things</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>wisdom:</strong> The word <em>wisdom</em> means “the ability to understand events and know the right action.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to translate <em>wisdom</em> as a phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wise words and actions</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>right and just thinking</p></blockquote><h4>11:33b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:33b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>How unsearchable are His judgments,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>His decisions cannot be searched/explained <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by people</span>,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">People</span> are not able to discern the ways he decides things.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>How unsearchable are His judgments:</strong> Here the word <em>How</em> expresses amazement that his judgments are indeed unsearchable by us. It does not indicate a question here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his judgments are beyond our understanding</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No one can explain the things God decides (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>unsearchable:</strong> This word indicates that people cannot study God’s judgments and learn what he based those judgments on.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His judgments:</strong> This refers to the decisions that God makes. Here the word <em>judgments</em> generally refers to more than what a judge does in court.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Moo (page 742) says the word refers here to “ ‘executive’ decisions about the direction of salvation history.”</span></span> Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his decisions (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the things God decides (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>11:33c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:33c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and untraceable His ways!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and the things he does cannot be tracked!</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">People</span> are not able to understand why he does what he does.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and:</strong> The meaning of 11:33c is similar to 11:33b. The similarity strengthens the meaning in a poetic way. In some languages omitting the word <em>and</em> would help better with that meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>untraceable:</strong> The Greek word here means “not able to follow the tracks.” People are not able to understand why God does what he does.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>His ways:</strong> Here the word <em>ways</em> refers to the things that God does.</p>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in view of God’s mercy (NIV) <em>(NIV, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It introduces <u>the reason why Paul urged them</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because of God’s great mercy to us (GNT) <em>(GNT, BSB, GW, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because the BDAG supports both (1) and (2), and (1) seems more likely here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>mercy:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>mercy</em> refers to concern for someone with troubles and here implies helping that person. It is one of the ways a father feels toward his children when they are in trouble and need help. (It is not the usual Greek word translated <em>mercy</em>.) Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>compassion (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sympathy<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kittel (page 680).</span></span></p></blockquote><h4>12:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to offer your bodies as a sacrifice <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that is</span> alive, holy <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span>, and it pleases him.</p></li><li><p>that you should give your bodies completely to him. It should be as if it was a sacrifice, but alive, belonging to him alone, which will make God happy.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to offer your bodies as living sacrifices:</strong> This is a figure of speech. It indicates that believers should allow God to say what they should do with their bodies. So the BSB and other English versions add the word <em>as</em>. In some languages it will be more clear to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Explain the figure of speech in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>give your life to serving God as if a sacrifice</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate literally and explain the meaning in a footnote. Here is an example footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>These words indicate that we are to wholly serve God.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to offer:</strong> Here the word <em>offer</em> refers to putting something in front of someone, either as a gift or for that person to do something with it. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>present (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>give (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God:</strong> The Greek is more literally “a sacrifice, living, holy, pleasing to God.” The words <em>living</em> and <em>holy</em> and the phrase <em>pleasing to God</em> all describe what kind of sacrifice this is. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a sacrifice—alive, holy, and pleasing to God (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a sacrifice that is living and holy and pleases God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>living:</strong> Here this word indicates that this sacrifice still lives and therefore is able to do God’s will. This is unlike usual sacrifices, which are killed at the altar and therefore not able to do anything.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sacrifices:</strong> As a part of the Jewish religion, people would kill an animal, put it over a fire, then offer it to God. They sometimes burnt the animal whole and sometimes they or the priests ate it, depending on the type of “sacrifice” that they were offering. This was done to honor and worship God. The Greeks and Romans did something similar for their gods.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>offering</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>gift for God to use</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>holy:</strong> Here this word means “set apart for God’s use.” It also implies that it is special, because it belongs to God. See how you translated this word in 11:16.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>pleasing to God:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>pleasing</em> also means “acceptable.” Presenting one’s body has to be the proper kind of sacrifice, so that God accepts it.</p><h4>12:1d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:1d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>which is your spiritual service of worship.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>That is your worship in your thoughts/heart.</p></li><li><p>That is a way for you to worship him in your mind/inner-being.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>which is your spiritual service of worship:</strong> These words further describe presenting your bodies as a sacrifice. It does not separate this presenting from other presentings. For the correct meaning in some languages, translators must avoid the word <em>which</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This is the way to worship him in your mind</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>That is your worship custom that is appropriate<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>spiritual:</strong> The Greek word here was used to describe a human being’s ability to think, an action that makes us different from animals. Paul probably used it here to describe worship that is true and proper. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the worship offered <u>by mind and heart</u> (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>intelligent (JBP)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>service of worship:</strong> This word refers to religious activities done for the purpose of honoring God.</p>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>allow <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> to transform</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word refers generally to changing the form or nature of something. Jesus was transformed on the high mountain (Matthew 17:2) from an ordinary looking person to one filled with light.

If one’s gift is prophecy, let him use it in proportion to his faith:</strong> The BSB adds the words <em>let him use it</em>. Many scholars and English versions agree that the Greek implies a command to use the gifts properly. For example, the ESV adds the words of a command in the last part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them (ESV)</p></blockquote><h4>12:6a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:6a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>We have different gifts according to the grace given us.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>We <span data-bnType=\"implied\">each</span> have different gifts according to the grace given to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">each of</span> us.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> gave to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">each of</span> us different gifts according to his kindness to us.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>We have different gifts:</strong> This clause indicates that all believers do not have the same gift. Paul listed seven of the gifts in 12:6b–8. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Having gifts that differ (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the gifts that we have differ (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>gifts:</strong> This word refers to something that is given without cost to the person receiving it. Paul listed seven of the gifts in 12:6b–8. See how you translated this word in 1:11 or 11:29.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the grace given us:</strong> This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the grace <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that God</span> gave to us</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>grace:</strong> This word refers to being kind to people without requiring anything in return. This kindness is not given because they have done anything to deserve it. See how you translated this word in 3:24 or 11:6.</p><h4>12:6b–8</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Each gift in the list has a phrase that begins with the Greek word that means “in.” Each phrase describes how each gift is to be used. Many languages must add a verb each time for a natural translation. See the note on 12:6a–b above or the individual notes below in 12:6b–8.</p><h4>12:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>If one’s gift is prophecy, let him use it in proportion to his faith;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>If prophecy, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">each of</span> us <span data-bnType=\"implied\">must prophesy</span> in accordance with the amount of faith we have.</p></li><li><p>If <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span><sup>(sing)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">have the gift of</span> messages of revelation, then you must speak those messages in the amount that your faith says is right.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>prophecy:</strong> The word <em>prophecy</em> refers to a message that God gives to someone. The message may include a vision, as in Ezekiel 1 and Daniel 8. A <em>prophecy</em> may reveal something about past events, current events, or future events. The prophet speaks the <em>prophecy</em> to the people or writes it down for their use.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages do not have a word for <em>prophecy</em>. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use a descriptive phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>direct message from God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s <span data-bnType=\"implied\">new</span> message</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a message that God has revealed</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, you may want to explain it in a footnote. Here is an example footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The word “prophecy” refers to a message that God gives to someone. The message may include a vision. A <em>prophecy</em> may reveal something about past events, current events, or future events.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>let him use it:</strong> The BSB adds these words. See the note at 12:6a–b about that.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">These gifts are given to each believer. They are not shared like someone might share a tool. Some languages must continue referring to the individual for the correct meaning, as the BSB does. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>let <span data-bnType=\"implied\">each of</span> us use them</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in proportion to his faith:</strong> Here the word <em>his</em> refers to each of us who have the gift of prophecy. Each of us with the gift of prophecy must use it according to how much faith we have. One cannot speak true prophecies when he does not have the faith for it. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>measured to the amount of faith <span data-bnType=\"implied\">each of</span> us <span data-bnType=\"implied\">have</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>sized to our faith</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>proportion:</strong> This word refers to the relative sizes or amounts of different sorts of things. In this context, in relation to a small amount of faith, the amount of prophecy would be small, but in relation to a large amount of faith, the amount of prophecy would also be large. See the examples above.</p>",

Paul referred to those with the gift of leadership. <em>(BSB, NIV, NJB, ESV, NASB, NRSV, KJV, NABRE, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, REB, NCV)</em></p></li><li><p>It means <u>have authority</u> here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>has authority (GNT) <em>(GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>give help</u> here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>gives aid (RSV) <em>(RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because many English versions support it.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Jewett (page 753) says, “the more general sense of ‘the one giving care’ also seems unlikely because it would then become completely redundant with regard to the gifts of serving and exhorting.” The GNT’s “has authority” is unclear if leadership is included in the meaning, so that interpretation should be avoided.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with diligence:</strong> There are several ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>diligence</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means leading <u>earnestly, without stopping</u> here. A leader should not become lazy and ignore his duties. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>diligently (NIV) <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, NASB, KJV, NRSV, NABRE, NLT, NET, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means leading <u>with enthusiasm</u> here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>enthusiastically (GW) <em>(RSV, ESV, GW, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word can mean either (1) or (2). It is hard to choose which sense Paul meant here. Some languages may have a word that allows both meanings, but many languages must choose one or the other. If that is true in your language, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because many English versions support it. But if the major language version follows interpretation (2), you may want to follow that.</p><h4>12:8d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:8d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>if it is showing mercy, let him do it cheerfully.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Or if <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span><sup>(sing)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">are</span> the one being merciful <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to others</span>, then be happy when you are being merciful.</p></li><li><p>Or if <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you have the gift of</span> helping <span data-bnType=\"implied\">others</span> when <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they</span> are in need/trouble, then happily help <span data-bnType=\"implied\">them</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>showing mercy:</strong> The scholars generally agree that the meaning here is to help people who are sick, hurt, poor, unable to work, or old.

It is difficult because there is no other clear example of this last meaning in the NT or any Greek literature of that time.</span></span> There are several ways to interpret the Greek word that means “going-first-and-leading-the-way” here. Here are the main ones:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>more than</u> here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>honor others more than you do yourself (CEV) <em>(NIV, NJB, CEV, REB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>strive to do more than</u> here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>outdo one another in showing honor (RSV) <em>(BSB, RSV, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>allowing others to go first</u> here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>give preference to one another in honor (NASB) <em>(NASB, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>be eager</u> here.

But few English versions follow that interpretation. For example, the Christian Standard Bible says, “Take the lead in honoring one another,’ and the Darby says, “as to honour, each taking the lead in paying it to the other.” Jewett (page 761) translates this word as “taking the lead in,” in other words, not waiting for others to honor someone. He says that interpretations (1), (2), and (3) are not supported in Greek literature. Witherington (page 293) translates 12:10b as, “go first and lead the way in showing honor to one another.”This author can also find no scholar who supports interpretation (4).</span></span></p>",

Cranfield (page 646) implies that the affection here is Paul’s, and Jewett (page 774) says the word is “personal.” But Moo (page 786) connects this to the love of God for the believers. However, overall it seems best to see this as Paul’s love for the believers in Rome.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>my dear friends (NJB)</p></blockquote><h4>12:19b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:19b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but leave room for God’s wrath.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But/And let God’s anger <span data-bnType=\"implied\">take revenge</span> at his time,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">No,</span> allow God to act in anger against that person when he chooses.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but:</strong> Some languages will not see contrast between “never avenge yourselves” and “leave it to the wrath of God.” For example the Uma Back Translation and the Otomi Back Translation (both on TW) omit this word.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>leave room for God’s wrath:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>leave room for</em> refers to waiting for someone else to do something. Believers should let God be angry with that person and do something to him, when and where God chooses to. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>leave it to the wrath of God (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>wait for God to punish them with his anger (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>allow the opportunity for God’s anger <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to avenge you</span></p></blockquote><h4>12:19c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:19c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For it is written: “Vengeance is Mine; I will repay, says the Lord.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>for some words that were written <span data-bnType=\"implied\">long ago</span> say, “The Lord says, ‘It is mine to take revenge.

The quote is from Deuteronomy 32:35. If you indicate the location of quotes from the Old Testament with cross-references, you may want to do so here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This quote was written hundreds of years before Paul wrote the letter to the Romans. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate the quote was written at the same time as Paul wrote here. If that is true in your language, indicate it was long before Paul wrote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it was written <span data-bnType=\"implied\">long ago</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause refers to what was written in the Old Testament. Some languages must make that explicit to make that connection clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the scripture says (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is passive. Moses wrote what God told him to write. Some languages must use an active clause here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Moses/someone</span> wrote <span data-bnType=\"implied\">long ago</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>what God caused-to-be-written saying,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it says in the Holy Book</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this clause in 1:17 or 11:26.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Vengeance is Mine; I will repay, says the Lord:</strong> In many languages it is more natural to have who speaks before what is spoken. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lord says, ‘Vengeance is mine, I will repay.’</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Vengeance is Mine:</strong> The word <em>Vengeance</em> refers to refers to hurting someone because they hurt you, as “avenge” does in 12:19a. Some languages must use a verb here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Deeds of revenge are mine <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to do</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Mine</em> is emphasized in the Greek by being first in the clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It is mine to avenge</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I will repay:</strong> This word refers to doing something in return to someone for what he did to you. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will pay back (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The meaning of <em>I</em> is emphasized in the Greek. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I myself will repay</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Lord:</strong> The word <em>Lord</em> refers to someone who has authority over people. Here this phrase refers to God. In some languages it is more natural to indicate who this <em>Lord</em> is. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated the word <em>Lord</em> in 4:8 or 12:11.</p>",

(2) Some later Greek manuscripts have the word <u>therefore</u>. (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1).</span></span> Some scholars believe these words indicate contrast to allowing God to take vengeance. Instead of just allowing God to take vengeance, a believer is supposed to help his enemy with food or something to drink. The English versions that indicate contrast do not say what they are contrasting to. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Instead (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Other scholars see this as indicating contrast to a believer taking vengeance. But in 12:19 Paul told the believers to not take vengeance. Some languages would not see that as contrasting.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">as the Scripture says,</span> “if your enemy is hungry…”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>feed him;:</strong> The semi-colon (;) after the word <em>him</em> indicates in English that there is a connection to the words that follow but does not say what that connection is. Some languages can use a semi-colon here. For example, the Kankanaey Back Translation says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>feed him; if…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a comma and a connecting word are most natural here. For example, the Ramoaina Back Translation says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you should feed him, and if…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a full stop is most natural. For example, the Tagbanwa Back Translation says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>feed (him).

In many languages <em>a drink</em> will not imply an alcoholic beverage.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a drink.:</strong> In some English versions, there is a semi-colon (;) after the word <em>drink</em>. This indicates in English that there is a connection to the words that follow but does not say what that connection is. But the connecting word “for” begins 12:20c. You should use a comma or a full stop here, as the BSB does.</p><h4>12:20c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:20c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For in so doing, you will heap burning coals on his head.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For when you do that to him, it will be <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as if</span> you heap hot coals on his head.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> Here this word introduces the reason for feeding a hungry enemy or giving a drink to a thirsty enemy.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in so doing:</strong> This phrase refers to feeding a hungry enemy or giving a drink to a thirsty enemy. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In doing this (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when you do that</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you will heap burning coals on his head:</strong> This is a figure of speech. The scholars have several opinions about what it means:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to causing the enemy to be ashamed for the bad things he has done to the believer (Cranfield and others).</p></li><li><p>It refers to adding more punishment for God to give the enemy at the final judgment (Schreiner and others).</p></li><li><p>It refers to a rite, originally Egyptian, of repentance, so implies the enemy repents (Dunn and others).</p></li><li><p>It refers to hospitality, inviting the enemy to join in the Christian love feast (Jewett).</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The scholars argue for and against each of the options, except interpretation (4), which no one other than Jewett speaks to.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you translate literally, because it is not clear which interpretation is best. Many English versions translate literally here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you will be heaping red-hot coals on his head (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you translate literally you may want to explain its possible meanings in a footnote. Here is an example footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Heaping burning coals on someone’s head is a figure of speech. Here are the three ways it is usually interpreted: (1) it refers to causing the person to be ashamed, (2) it refers to added, later punishment that God will give this person, or (3) it refers to the person repenting. It is not clear which meaning is correct.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, if you must choose an interpretation, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because a few English versions follow it. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you will make them burn with shame (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you will heap burning coals of shame on their heads (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you will make him feel guilty and ashamed (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you translate according to interpretation (1), you may want to give a literal translation in a footnote. Here is an example footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Literally: “you will heap burning coals on his head.”</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 12:20a–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">These words are a quote of Proverbs 25:21–22.

Our thinking must change so that it follows the will of God and not the thinking of the people of this world.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul also taught that believers should not be more proud of themselves than what is right before God. We all have different gifts from the Holy Spirit, and we should use them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Believers should love in a genuine way, avoid evil deeds, honor others, be full of eagerness to serve the Lord. They should rejoice, be patient, pray, help others, and show hospitality.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Believers should bless the people who persecute them, and live in sympathy and harmony with other believers. They are not to be proud such that they avoid people with no status in society. They are not to think of themselves as wise.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Believers are not to take revenge, but leave that for God to do something about the evil done to them. They are to do things that are honorable and live at peace with others, if they can. They are to bless their enemies by doing good to them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The New Life in Christ (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Our bodies, thinking, and deeds must be holy and good</p></blockquote></div><h4>12:21a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:21a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Do not be overcome by evil,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Evil must not be victorious over you<sup>(sing)</sup>,</p></li><li><p>When someone does harm to you, do not allow that to defeat you<sup>(plur)</sup>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Do not be overcome by evil:</strong> This clause is passive.

The Greek lexicons use similar definitions for these words. They both refer to opposing something or someone. The scholars who say the two words mean nearly the same thing do not say how they differ in meaning.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that is, he is an agent who brings retribution to the wrongdoer</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he is an avenger who applies wrath on the wrongdoer</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>agent:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>agent</em> is more literally “avenger.” This word refers to a person who punishes people for the evil that they did to someone else.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDAG.</span></span> For example, if Tom hurt Bill, Sam could “avenge” Bill by punishing Tom. Here is another way to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>one who avenges</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>of retribution to the wrongdoer:</strong> There are two ways to interpret whose <em>retribution</em> this is:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is the retribution/wrath <u>of the avenger</u>.

This author follows the same interpretation there.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>of retribution to:</strong> The Greek is literally “to/for wrath to.” Here it indicates the goal of avenging; the government leader causes wrath, in the form of punishment, to come to the wrongdoer. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>for wrath <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be applied</span> to</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>to cause wrath <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to fall</span> on</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>to punish</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>retribution:</strong> The Greek word is more literally “wrath.” It refers generally to strong emotion, usually anger or passion, depending on the context. Sometimes, as here, it focuses on the actions taken in that anger. Here it implies that the government authorities punish the evildoer for his evil deeds, which is why the BSB translates it as <em>retribution</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would imply evil deeds done to this evildoer rather than punishment. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Translate the implied meaning here.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the Scriptures</span> , “Do not commit adultery…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages must add an “and” before the second, third, and fourth items in this list.

So the BSB and many other English versions use commas or semi-colons, rather than full stops, to indicate that. In some languages it will be more clear to separate the list from verb phrase and then clearly indicate the connection in the translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>For <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God said</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Scripture</span>, “Do not commit adultery. Do not murder.

In many languages, no conjunction would imply that.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some scholars see contrast here to 13:14. For example, Dunn translates the Greek word as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Accept him whose faith is weak:</strong> In the Greek, the phrase translated <em>him whose faith is weak</em> occurs before the verb <em>Accept</em> to emphasize it. Some languages can put this phrase in front without those added words. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the one who is weak in faith, welcome him</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions add words to introduce this phrase. Some languages can follow these versions or use other words to introduce this phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>Concerning</u> the believer who does not yet understand well about the word he believes, there where you meet together give him a welcome.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>If there is</u> a person whose faith is not yet mature or is weak, accept him<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Other languages must put this phrase in its normal place for a natural translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>welcome the one whose faith is weak</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Accept:</strong> The Greek word refers to bringing in someone into your group of friends and accepting him or her. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>welcome (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>receive well<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>him whose faith is weak:</strong> This phrase refers to someone who has faith but believes that his faith limits what he can do. Paul called it <em>weak</em> because this person limits what he can do more than someone whose faith is not <em>weak</em>. Paul gave an example of this difference in faith in 14:2. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the one who is not strong in faith</p></blockquote><h4>14:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"14:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>without passing judgment on his opinions.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But do not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">accept them just to</span> argue with them about their thoughts <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that are different</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">than yours</span>.</p></li><li><p>But do not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">welcome him into your group only so that you can</span> argue with him about his thoughts <span data-bnType=\"implied\">on religious practices</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that are different than yours</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>without passing judgment on his opinions:</strong> This is a purpose clause.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Some people believe that they can eat all kinds of food (GW) <em>(RSV, ESV, NABRE, KJV, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It indicates that <u>his faith in God allows him to eat any food</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Some people’s faith allows them to eat anything (GNT) <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, NJB, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek <em>to eat</em> after <em>faith</em> supports interpretation (1), but the Greek “being weak” (14:1a, 2b) supports interpretation (2). Perhaps Paul intended both meanings, as Moo (page 837) suggests. If you must choose one interpretation, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because the phrase <em>to eat</em> suggests this interpretation here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>For one person has faith to eat:</strong> The Greek and English here refers generally to anyone, man or woman. In some languages, the plural would more clearly refer to believers in general. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Some people believe that they may eat anything</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>has faith to eat:</strong> Many Gentile believers did not feel compelled to follow the Jewish food restrictions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>eat all things:</strong> This phrase implies any food. It does not refer to items that are not food, like rocks and wood. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>any kind of food (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>14:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"14:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>while another, who is weak, eats only vegetables.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but a/another person/believer is weak <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in his faith</span> and eats only garden food.</p></li><li><p>But other people are not strong <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the same way</span> and eat only food from the garden.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>while another, who is weak:</strong> The Greek is literally “but the one being weak.” It contrasts to the person who believes in 14:2a. In some languages <em>weak</em> refers only to lack of physical strength. If that is true in your language, indicate the correct meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but the person who is not strong <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in faith</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>another, who is weak:</strong> If you translated with the plural for “one person” in 14:2a, you should use the plural here as well.

This verse is an example of “strong” believers not disputing with “weak” believers about their “problem.” Explaining the exact situation (even if we were certain what it was) is not important here.</p></div>",

Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Why do you think that you are someone with the authority to judge someone else’s servant?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What right do you have to consider someone else’s servant as a bad person?</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>If he stands or falls, it is to his own master</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he stands or falls indeed only to his own master</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>master:</strong> The Greek word here is usually translated “lord.” It refers to someone who has authority over someone else, like a ruler or the leader of the family living in that house.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul here was referring generally to masters and servants. He explained in particular who he was referring to in 14:4d, so you should not need to explain it here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>he stands or falls:</strong> Here the word <em>stands</em> is a figure of speech that refers to the master saying the servant has done right. Here the word <em>falls</em> is a figure of speech that refers to the master saying the servant has done wrong.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Moo (page 857) and Schreiner (page 718).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would not have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate the meaning without the figures of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he is told he has done right or not</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his master says that he has done right or he has done wrong</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate literally and explain it in a footnote. Here is an example footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Here the word “stands” refers to the master saying that the servant has done right and the word “falls” refers to the master saying that the servant has done wrong.</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>14:4c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"14:4c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And he will stand,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And he will be considered to have stood,</p></li><li><p>And <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his own boss, the Lord,</span> will say to him that he is approved/accepted,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And he will stand:</strong> In Greek, this clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">his master</span> will uphold him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the Lord</span> will uphold him</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>will:</strong> It is not clear when in the future the Lord would uphold his servant. It could be at some time in the life of the servant on earth, or it could be when God judges believers in the great judgment. Use the grammar in your language that indicates generally a future time.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>stand:</strong> Here this phrase refers to indicating that someone is accepted or approved. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>what he is doing will of course be approved as right<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>be established <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as approved</span></p></blockquote><h4>14:4d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"14:4d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for the Lord is able to make him stand.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>for the Lord can make him stand.</p></li><li><p>because the Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus</span> has the ability/power to help him so that he is approved/accepted.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Lord:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is a textual issue in 14:4d: (1) Some Greek manuscripts have the word <u>Lord</u> (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NABRE, ESV, REB, NLT, GW, NET, NCV).

It is not clear whether it refers to God or Jesus here. It probably refers to Jesus, since God is mentioned in 14:3 using the Greek word for God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to make him stand:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>to make…stand</em> is the same word that the BSB translates as “stand” in 14:4c. You should translate it similarly to how you translated it there.

It emphasizes that believers should not <em>judge</em> another believer. It is a rebuke to anyone who does that. Here are some ways to translate that meaning:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>why do you judge your brother or sister? (NIV11)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Why do you think it is right to consider a fellow believer to be a bad person?</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You have no reason to judge your brother or sister as a bad person!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You have no reason to consider a fellow believer to be a bad person.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a command. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not think that you have a good reason to judge your brother or sister as a bad person!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not think that you have a good reason to consider a fellow believer to be a bad person.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>then:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>then</em> is often translated as “but” or “and.” However, this verse uses some of the wording from 14:3 and exhorts believers to not pass judgment on a fellow believer or despise him or her. So, the BSB uses <em>then</em> to indicate that Paul is returning to those thoughts. Here is another way to express the idea:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You, then, why… (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>do you judge:</strong> Here this phrase refers to considering someone to be a bad person. It does not refer here to what a judge does in a courtroom. See how you translated this phrase in 14:3b.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>you:</strong> This word is emphasized in the Greek by being first in the clause. If possible, emphasize this word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>As for you, why do you…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>Hey you, why do you…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>brother:</strong> Here this word refers to any believer living in Rome, either man or woman. See how you translated this word in 1:13 or 12:1.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">By using the singular <em>brother</em>, Paul referred generally to any believer, where the plural might imply all the believers in Rome. In some languages a simple singular might indicate that Paul was thinking of one specific person. If that is true in your language, translate in a way that can refer generally to one or a few. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>some of you, brothers,</p></blockquote><h4>14:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"14:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Or why do you belittle your brother?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Or why do you scorn your fellow believer?</p></li><li><p>And none of you should think of your brother or sister <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span> as being of little/no worth.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Or why do you:</strong> The Greek is more literally “Or and/indeed why do you.” The word “and/indeed” emphasizes the following question.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you:</strong> This word is emphasized in the Greek, as it is in 14:10a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>why do you belittle your brother?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question with the same emphasis as the rhetorical question in 14:10a, except that the word <em>belittle</em> is used here instead of “pass judgment.” Translate this rhetorical question in the same way you did in 14:10, except for the word <em>belittle</em> here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>belittle:</strong> This word refers to considering someone to be worthless.

Instead they should choose not to hinder them. He told them that God does not consider any kind of food or any other kind of thing as not acceptable, but people who think that that food or thing is unacceptable, they should not eat it or use it. But those who find those things acceptable, they should not hurt the faith of those who find those things unacceptable. Righteousness, peace, and joy are the important things in God’s kingdom, not what you eat or drink. God is pleased when those who follow Jesus live in that way.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul encouraged the believers to do things that bring peace and encouragement for each other. They are not to hurt other believers over what they eat. They are not to cause other believers to stumble in their faith because of what they eat. Foods that might cause problems for other believers are to be eaten privately. A believer should not eat food if he has doubts about whether he should eat it or not. Everything that is not done in faith is sin.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do Not Cause Another to Stumble (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Don’t Cause Problems for Others (CEV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>14:13a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"14:13a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Therefore let us stop judging one another.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ So, we<sup>(incl)</sup> must stop condemning each other.</p></li><li><p>¶ So then, we must no longer think that other believers are bad people.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Therefore:</strong> Here the Greek word introduces a summary of 14:1–12.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>let us stop judging one another:</strong> This clause indicates that Paul wanted the believers to stop passing judgment on other believers. He included himself in this command. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we<sup>(incl)</sup> must no longer condemn one another</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we must stop considering each other as bad people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>let’s stop criticizing each other (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>us:</strong> Here this word refers to Paul and all the believers in Rome. It does not refer to only one group of believers in Rome, as it did in 14:2a or 14:2b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>judging:</strong> Here this phrase refers to considering someone to be a bad person. See how you translated this phrase in 14:3 or 14:10.</p><h4>14:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"14:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Instead, make up your mind</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Instead, we must choose to do this:</p></li><li><p>We must think like this:</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Instead:</strong> This indicates contrast to passing judgment on one another. But the command in 14:13a is to stop passing judgment. So in some languages indicating contrast would confuse the connection. If that is true in your language, translate without the contrast. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And/Also</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Like-that, studiously make the mindset…<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Yongkom Back Translation, by author, unpublished manuscript, Papua New Guinea.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We-inc should think<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Ramoaina Back Translation, Lisbeth Fritzell &amp; Robyn Davies, unpublished manuscript, Papua New Guinea.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>make up your mind:</strong> This word refers to thinking about something and choosing a way to think about it or do something about it.

It refers to 14:13c and emphasizes that meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>decide this</u>: never put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother</p></blockquote><h4>14:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"14:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in your brother’s way.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Do not put in front of a fellow believer <span data-bnType=\"implied\">something like</span> a rock/root to make him stumble or <span data-bnType=\"implied\">something like</span> a trap to make him sin.</p></li><li><p>We must not do anything that will cause a brother or sister <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span> to have trouble in their faith or to sin.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not to:</strong> The Greek is simply the word <em>not</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>any stumbling block:</strong> This phrase refers to something that causes someone to stumble or trip. Here it is a metaphor that refers to doing anything that causes someone else to sin. Translate in a way that clearly indicates the meaning. Here are some ways:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Change the metaphor to a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">something like</span> a stumbling block</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>upset anyone’s faith (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Your language may have a cultural item that will have the same meaning as this metaphor.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a root/rock to stumble on</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>obstacle:</strong> The Greek word here refers to a trap. Here it is a metaphor that refers to doing anything that causes someone to do the wrong thing. Translate in a way that clearly indicates the meaning. Here are some ways:</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 14:13c</strong></h5><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use the literal sense of the Greek word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a trap (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Change the metaphor to a simile and possibly explain why they are similar in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">something like</span> a trap <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that causes temptation</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>temptation</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">The meaning of the metaphor of a stumbling block is similar to the meaning of the metaphor of a obstacle/trap. In some languages it is more natural to translate the meaning with one word or phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Let us earnestly see to it that it is not our fault that our brothers should sin.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>caused to sin<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Yakan Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote></div>",

In particular, some Jewish believers in Jesus still followed the Jewish rules about food. So there were many foods in Rome that they believed it was not right to eat. But Roman believers did not follow the Jewish rules about food and ate those foods. Paul just said it was okay to eat such foods, but we must think of the Jewish believers because it would be a sin for them to eat those foods.

Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has condemned whoever has doubts</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>doubts:</strong> This word refers to not being certain about something. A person thinks that maybe it is good but maybe it is bad. Or a person thinks that maybe it is right or maybe wrong.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>is condemned:</strong> The Greek tense indicates that God has already condemned this person and that condemnation remains in effect.

Some languages cannot use the noun <em>eating</em> here. If that is true in your language, use a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when he eats <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like that</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>faith:</strong> The meaning is the same as “belief” in 14:22a.</p><h4>14:23c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"14:23c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and everything that is not from faith is sin.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And anything <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he does</span> that is not based in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his</span> faith is sin.</p></li><li><p>Something <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you do</span>, if you do not do it because you believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Jesus</span>, you are sinning.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and:</strong> The Greek word here is usually translated as <em>and</em> or “but.” It introduces a general principle related to what Paul wrote about in 14:23a–b.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Anything that is… (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that is not from:</strong> The Greek is literally “(is) not out of.” If a believer does something because he doubts rather than because he believes in Jesus, then he is sinning.

The word <em>that</em> introduces what Paul wanted to tell them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a servant of the circumcised:</strong> The Greek is more literally “a servant of the circumcision.” There are two ways to interpret the Greek word ending that often means <em>of</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It indicates that <u>Jesus served the circumcised</u>, that is, the Jews. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>serve the circumcised (NJB) <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, NJB, NASB, NABRE, KJV, ESV, NLT, NET, CEV, REB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It indicates that <u>Jesus served others on behalf of the circumcised</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>life of service was on behalf of the Jews (GNT) <em>(GNT, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because it fits better with showing God’s truthfulness (15:8b) and confirming the promises to the Jewish ancestors (15:8c).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See also Moo (page 877) or Morris (page 503).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a servant:</strong> The work of a <em>servant</em> was to help another person with his needs and wants. This other person tells him what he needs or wants, and the servant helps him with that need or want.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Jesus was a servant by doing things for the Jews that showed God’s truthfulness (15:8b). He did not take orders from the Jews as a servant usually would. Consider if your usual word or phrase for <em>servant</em> is fitting in this context.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the circumcised:</strong> Here this phrase refers to the Jews. In some languages a literal translation may not clearly indicate that. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Explain in the text. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the circumcised, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that is, the Jews</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate literally and explain the meaning in a footnote. Here is an example footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This refers to the Jews.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>circumcised:</strong> The word <em>circumcised</em> refers to cutting off the loose skin at the end of a boy’s or man’s penis. See how you translated this word in 2:25 or 4:12.</p><h4>15:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"15:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>on behalf of God’s truth,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He did that</span> to show that what God says is true,</p></li><li><p>In that way he showed that God is true when he speaks,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God’s truth:</strong> There are several ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>truth</em>. Here are the two main ones:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>the characteristic or habit of speaking the truth</u>. God always speaks the truth. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the truthfulness of God (NJB) <em>(RSV, ESV, NJB, NABRE)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>truth</u>. The words of God are true. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s truth (NIV) <em>(BSB, NIV, NASB, KJV, NRSV, GW, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>being true to one’s promises</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God is faithful (GNT) <em>(GNT, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because the BDAG supports it. The BDAG does not list interpretation (3) as a sense of this Greek word.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 15:8b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The Greek is translated as a purpose clause. Jesus fulfilled this purpose during his time on earth. In some languages purpose clauses are always unfulfilled. If that is true in your language, indicate that Jesus fulfilled this purpose. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and showed God’s truthfulness</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and showed that what God says is true</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Often fulfilled purpose clauses are translated as result clauses. But here it was not only Christ <u><em>becoming</em></u> a servant that showed God’s truthfulness but also his deeds as that servant. So the above examples only imply the result connection. Consider what the best connection is in your language.</p></div><h4>15:8c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"15:8c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to confirm the promises made to the patriarchs,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and to make certain the promises that were given to the forefathers,</p></li><li><p>which caused <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> to know that the things <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that God</span> promised to the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jewish</span> ancestors were certain.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to:</strong> This phrase introduces a second purpose clause. The first purpose clause, to show that God is truthful (15:8b), is a general statement. This purpose clause, to confirm God’s promises, is a part of that more general statement.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Jesus fulfilled this purpose of confirming the promises during his time on earth. In some languages purpose clauses are always unfulfilled. If that is true in your language, indicate that Jesus fulfilled this purpose. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and confirmed…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>confirm:</strong> There are several ways to interpret the Greek word here. Here are the two main ones:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>to cause something to be known as certain</u> (L&amp;N). The English word <em>confirm</em> indicates that meaning here. <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, ESV, NABRE, NASB, KJV, NET)</em></p></li><li><p>It means <u>to cause something that was promised to happen</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>make…come true (GNT) <em>(GNT, NJB, GW, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because the BDAG and L&amp;N both support it.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the promises made:</strong> This is a passive clause. In some languages an active clause must be used. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the promises <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that God</span> made</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>patriarchs:</strong> Here this word refers to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>forefathers</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jewish ancestors (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 9:5 or 11:28 (“patriarchs”).</p>",

If you indicate the location of quotes from the Old Testament with cross-references, you may want to do so here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And once more, Isaiah says:</strong> This refers to what Isaiah wrote in Scripture. If you added the implied information about the quotes in 15:9–11 being from Scripture, you may want to include it here too. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And also <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the Scriptures</span> Isaiah said</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(alt:) the shoot of Jesse:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that is translated as <em>shoot</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to <u>a shoot from the root and it is a figure of speech for a descendant</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>descendant (GNT) <em>(GNT, REB, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to <u>a root</u>. <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, NJB, ESV, NABRE, NASB, KJV, GW, NET)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because the BDAG supports it. Either way this phrase is a title for the Messiah/Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Jesse:</strong> Jesse was King David’s father. The phrase “the shoot of Jesse” is used in the book of Isaiah as a reference to the Messiah. If readers of your translation will not be familiar with who Jesse is or this title for the Messiah, you may want to explain it in a footnote. Here are some example footnotes:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Jesse was King David’s father.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The words “the shoot of Jesse” are a title for the Messiah. Jesse was King David’s father.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will appear:</strong> The Greek word is more literally “will be.” It indicates that, in the future to when this was first said, the shoot of Jesse will exist. In English “there is” is the most natural translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>There will be</u> the shoot of Jesse</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">But in many languages following this English translation would not indicate the correct meaning. A verb other than “be” may be needed. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will arrive</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will come (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages continuing the figurative language from “the shoot of Jesse” would be more natural. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The shoot of Jesse <u>will arise</u></p></blockquote><h4>15:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"15:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>One who will arise to rule over the Gentiles;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>indeed, he will stand <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and begin</span> to rule the Gentiles.</p></li><li><p>Hey/Look, he will go <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and start</span> ruling the non-Jews.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>One who will arise to rule over the Gentiles:</strong> The Greek of 15:12b begins with a word that is often translated “and” or “also.” Here the word introduces something more about the shoot of Jesse. It emphasizes the words that follow and says they are as important or possibly more important than what was just said. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>indeed, one who will arise to rule</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>One who will arise to rule:</strong> The Greek is present tense here, but this event occurs at the same time as the future event of “there will be the shoot of Jesse” (15:12a). You should probably use the same tense here as you did in the clause about the shoot of Jesse.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>will arise to rule:</strong> The words <em>will arise</em> refers to standing up from sitting or lying down. Here it is a figure of speech that means “comes to do” something. The purpose of this man arising is <em>to rule</em>. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>appears <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and begins</span> to rule</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>takes on the work of ruling</p></blockquote><h4>15:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"15:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in Him the Gentiles will put their hope.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>In him Gentiles will hope.”</p></li><li><p>Non-Jews will confidently expect <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that he will do as he has promised</span>.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in Him the Gentiles will put their hope:</strong> The phrase <em>in Him</em> is emphasized by being first in the clause. In some languages the phrase must be in its normal place. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Gentiles will put their hope in him</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some of these languages can emphasize this phrase in another way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Gentiles will put their hope in him indeed</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Gentiles will put their hope, hey, in him</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in Him…hope:</strong> These Gentiles will believe in God and his Messiah, and so they will have hope that he will fulfill his other promises in Scripture.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages must say what is hoped for, more than just hoping <em>in Him</em>. If that is true in your language, refer to fulfillment of God’s promises that are not yet fulfilled. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>hope in his <span data-bnType=\"implied\">promises</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>hope that he <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will fulfill his promises</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a quote from what is now called the Old Testament. You should not refer to anything that is specifically Christian or from the New Testament.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Gentiles:</strong> Here this refers to Gentiles as a kind of person. It does not imply all Gentiles. In English omitting the word <em>the</em> refers to the kind of person called <em>Gentiles</em> but does not imply all of them.

Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God, the source of hope, (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God, who gives hope, (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>hope:</strong> This word refers to wanting something to happen or even confident expectation that something will happen. The meaning is “confident expectation” here. See how you translated this word in 4:18 or 12:12.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>fill:</strong> Here this word is a figure of speech that indicates that God will give completely the ability to have joy and peace. Some languages can use <em>fill</em> in that way. Some languages must translate with a different word or phrase for the correct meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>give in/an abundance</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>cause that you may completely rejoice…<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>give you happiness and peace…that is complete<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>all joy and peace:</strong> The word <em>all</em> connects to both <em>joy</em> and <em>peace</em>. In some languages it is more clear or natural to repeat this word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>all joy and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all</span> peace</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>all:</strong> Here this word refers to all kinds of joy and all kinds of peace. In some languages the word <em>all</em> cannot be placed with a singular item like joy or peace. If that is true in your language, translate the correct meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all kinds of joy and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all kinds of</span> peace</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>joy:</strong> This word refers to a continuing experience of being happy or glad.

See how you translated this word in 1:7 or 14:17.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as you believe in Him:</strong> There are several ways to interpret the Greek words here. Here are the three main ones:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>within the sphere or influence of believing</u>. Joy and peace are experienced within the sphere or influence of believing. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in your faith (NJB) <em>(RSV, NJB, ESV, NABRE, NASB, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It indicates that <u>believing is the way in which one experiences or gets</u> joy and peace. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>by means of your faith in him (GNT) <em>(GNT, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It indicates that joy and peace <u>are experienced at the same time as one believes</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as you believe in him (NET) <em>(BSB, NIV, NET, REB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because it seems the most fitting definition here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>believe in Him:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>believe</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to <u>faith</u>, as in the BSB. <em>(BSB, RSV, GNT, NJB, NABRE, ESV, NASB, KJV, GW, CEV, NET, REB)</em></p></li><li><p>It refers to <u>trust</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>trust (NIV) <em>(NIV, NLT, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek is in the present tense, which indicates an ongoing faith.</p><h4>15:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"15:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">May that filling with joy and peace give to</span> you great hope by the power of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> Holy Spirit.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">If God fills you in that way,</span> the Holy Spirit, by his power, will give you much hope.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that:</strong> These words introduce the purpose of Paul praying for God to give them joy, peace, and hope.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit:</strong> Some English versions place <em>by the power of the Holy Spirit</em> first in the clause to emphasize it. However, in the Greek it is a place that does not normally indicate emphasis. Place this phrase wherever is most natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>overflow with hope:</strong> Here the word <em>overflow</em> refers to having very much hope. The Greek word is the verb related to the word that means “abundant.” Paul wanted them to have abundant hope. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>be rich in hope (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>filled full of hope</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>have very great hope</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>hope <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in God</span> in complete sufficiency</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>hope very strongly/much</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Holy Spirit:</strong> This phrase refers to God’s Spirit. The word <em>Spirit</em> is used in a similar way that a person refers to his spirit. The word <em>Holy</em> here means “clean” or “sacred.” But it also refers to “coming from God.” See how you translated this phrase in 5:5 or 14:17.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In this division, Paul encouraged the believers in Rome and explained the purpose of his letter. He said that he was proud of his work as an apostle. He explained why he usually went to places where people had not heard about Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Then Paul explained his plans to come to Rome on his way to Spain. He asked for their prayers, that God would protect him from Jews who did not believe in Jesus, that he would help the believers in Jerusalem and that God would allow him to visit the believers in Rome.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Then he commended and greeted various believers there in Rome.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this division:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Conclusion and personal greetings (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Conclusion/Ending of the letter</p></blockquote>",

But the quote (15:21b–c) contrasts to “building on someone else’s foundation.” The quote supports “I would not be building on someone else’s foundation” (15:20c) rather than contrasts with it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages indicating contrast would indicate the correct meaning of the connection. But in some languages omitting the contrast would indicate the correct connection.

If you indicate the location of quotes from the Old Testament with cross-references, you may want to do so here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Those who were not told:</strong> This is a passive clause. It implies someone telling these people rather than just overhearing the message. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Those whom someone has not told</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages can use “hear” and still imply that someone told them rather than just overhearing.

Jews of Paul’s time understood this as a reference to the Messiah. This is a quote from the Old Testament. You should not explain to whom <em>Him</em> refers in your translation, or add the name Jesus. You may want to explain the meaning in a footnote.

There are several ways to interpret the Greek sentence structure here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><u>Take both “having” verbs as “I have</u>.” Greek sometimes uses an -ing ending for a verb with a normal ending. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But now I have no new opportunities for work in this region. For many years I have wanted to visit you (GW) <em>(REB, NET, GW, CEV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p><u>Take the second “having” verb as “I have</u>.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But now, with no further place for me in these regions, I desire, as I have for many years, to come to you (NRSV) <em>(NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p><u>Keep both verbs as “having” and add “I plan</u>.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But now that there is no more place for me to work in these regions, and since I have been longing for many years to see you, <sup>24</sup>I plan to do so (NIV) <em>(NIV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p><u>Keep both verbs as “having” and pull “I hope” from later in 15:24</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But now that I have finished my work in these regions and since I have been wanting for so many years to come to see you, <sup>24</sup>I hope to do so now (GNT) <em>(BSB, RSV, GNT, NJB, ESV, NCV, NABRE)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because it is a fairly common process in Greek to take a verb with the -ing ending and drop the meaning of -ing. It seems better to treat both “having” verbs equally (interpretation 1) rather than differently (interpretation 2). And interpreting the verse here as having this process occurring seems better than adding words to the text (interpretation 3). And it is better than pulling “I hope” out of its “for” clause (interpretation 4).</p><h4>15:23a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"15:23a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But now that there are no further opportunities for me in these regions,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But at the present time I no longer have new places within those regions to preach.</p></li><li><p>But these days I have no new opportunity in those regions to do my <span data-bnType=\"implied\">apostle</span> work.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But now:</strong> This phrase indicates contrast to being hindered in the past. The word <em>now</em> refers to the time that Paul wrote the letter.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>there are no further opportunities for me in these regions:</strong> This indicates that Paul had preached where no one had yet preached throughout the area between Jerusalem and Illyricum (15:19). He must now find new places. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>there is no more place for me to work in these regions (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have finished my work in these regions (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>there are no further opportunities for me:</strong> The word <em>opportunities</em> refers to having enough space in which to do something. There were no new areas between Jerusalem and Illyricum where Paul could preach where someone had not already preached. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>there is no more place for me (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>opportunities</em> has its figurative sense here, “a favorable circumstance for doing something” (BDAG, sense 4). Here are other ways to translate according to that meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I no longer have any opportunity (NABRE)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>there is nothing left for me to do (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I have finished my work (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>these regions:</strong> This refers to the area between Jerusalem and Illyricum (15:19). In some languages the word “those” would be more natural to refer back to the regions Paul talked about in 15:19. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those regions</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>regions:</strong> The singular Greek word refers to an area the size of a Roman province or smaller, but larger than a city and its surrounding area.</p><h4>15:23b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"15:23b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and since I have longed for many years to visit you,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I have wanted/desired for many years to go/come to you</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I have longed:</strong> This Greek phrase is more literally “I have had a desire.” Paul had wanted to go to Rome for a long time.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for many years:</strong> Here the word <em>many</em> refers to probably twenty or less. It does imply a long time, not just one or two years. Do not use a word that indicates or implies much more than twenty years.</p>",

Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I hope to visit you while passing through (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I hope to see you while traveling through (TLV)</p></blockquote><h4>15:24b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"15:24b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And after I have enjoyed your company for a while,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and after I have enjoyed visiting with you for a while,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>after:</strong> Paul hoped that after he stayed with them a little while they would help him travel to Spain.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I have enjoyed your company:</strong> This refers to being happy with his visit with the believers in Rome.

However, since enjoying their company would occur before being helped on his journey, the BSB has reversed these clauses. In some languages it is acceptable to follow the Greek and have 15:24c first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>24c</sup>and to be helped on my journey there by you, <sup>24b</sup>once I have enjoyed your company for a while (ESV)</p></blockquote></div>",

He also explained that he was currently going to Jerusalem with a gift of money for the poor believers there from the believers in Macedonia and Achaia. Once he was finished with that, he planned to go to Spain.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul asked the believers in Rome to pray for him. Paul wanted to avoid being blocked in his ministry by Jews who did not believe in Jesus. He also asked them to pray that the gift he was taking to Jerusalem would be acceptable to the believers there. If it was, he would have joy and be able to enjoy his visit with the believers in Rome.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul wanted to visit the believers in Rome on his way to Spain</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s Plan to Visit Rome (NIV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>15:27a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"15:27a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>They were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For they have gladly chosen to help, and they are indebted to them.</p></li><li><p>For they were willing, but they also have a duty/obligation to help the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jewish</span> believers <span data-bnType=\"implied\">there</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">The Greek of 15:27a begins with a word that is often translated as “for.” The BSB omits this word. It introduces an explanation of “make a contribution” in 15:26a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>They were pleased to do it, and indeed:</strong> The phrase <em>They were pleased to do it</em> translates one Greek word, which the BSB translates as <em>were pleased</em> in 15:26a. The phrase <em>and indeed</em> translates one Greek word, usually translated as <em>and</em> or “but,” and sometimes <em>indeed</em>. Together in this situation the two Greek words indicate <u>in addition to being pleased to</u> help the poor believers in Jerusalem, they are <u>also</u> indebted to them. Here are other ways to translate these words:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they were pleased to do so, and (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they were pleased to do that, but also</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they owe it to them:</strong> The Greek is more literally “they are their debtors.” The Savior of the world, Jesus, was born a Jew, and God worked in the history of the Jews to bring about his coming. The spiritual blessings from those things require Gentile believers to help the Jewish believers in Jerusalem with material things in return. Here are other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they are in debt to them (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they have an obligation to help them (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>15:27b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"15:27b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual blessings,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For if the Gentiles have begun to share in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> blessings to their spirits, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and that is true,</span></p></li><li><p>For the non-Jews now share in the blessings <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that God gave</span> to the Jews, blessings of/in the spirit. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Therefore</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> Here this word introduces an explanation of “they owe it to them” in 15:27a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual blessings:</strong> Here the word <em>if</em> introduces a situation that is true. If this first part is true, that supports the second part to also be true (they ought also to be of service to the Jews in material blessings (15:27c)).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, translating literally here would have a different meaning. If that is true in your language, translate the correct meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if <span data-bnType=\"implied\">it is true that</span> the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">therefore</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>have shared:</strong> Long ago the Gentiles did not share in the spiritual blessings of the Jews but in the more recent past they began to share in them. Sharing in the blessings began when Gentiles such as Cornelius (Acts 10) began believing in Jesus as the Christ/Messiah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>have begun to share</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>have come to share (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek tense is often translated by the English past tense, but it does not imply that the sharing has stopped, as the English past tense sometimes does.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>their spiritual blessings:</strong> This phrase refers to the blessings that God gave to the Jews, including his promises to them and him calling them his people. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>their blessings in their spirits</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the blessings <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that God gave</span> to their spirits</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>spiritual:</strong> Here this word refers to things of the spirit and religion, rather than physical things such as crops and houses. See the above examples.</p><h4>15:27c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"15:27c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>they are obligated to minister to them with material blessings.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>then they must also serve them with <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> blessings to their needs.</p></li><li><p>the non-Jews have a duty/obligation to help them with the things they have for their physical needs, blessings of the things of this earth.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they are obligated:</strong> Here the phrase <em>are obligated</em> indicates that the Gentiles <u>should</u> be of service to the Jews. The Greek has the same root as “owe” in 15:27a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to minister to them with material blessings:</strong> Here the words <em>to minister to them</em> refers to doing things that benefit others. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>use their material blessings to help (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to serve them in material blessings (NABRE)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>material blessings:</strong> This refers to physical things that God has blessed people with, implying all the things a person has, including money, food, and homes. In this case the believers only send money, but Paul here spoke generally. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>blessings that are physical/things</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the blessings <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that God gave</span> for their physical needs</p></blockquote>",

He causes others to have peace. The whole phrase describes the one true God. It does <u>not</u> imply that there are many gods and there is one that gives peace.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>peace:</strong> This word refers to having no conflicts with other people or with God. The Greek word may also indicate wholeness or well-being.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The BDAG (pages 287–288) has two main senses: (1), “a state of concord, <em>peace, harmony</em>”; (2), “a state of well-being, <em>peace</em>.” They list this verse under (2) but as a specialized sense: “nearly synonymous with messianic salvation.” But neither Louw-Nida nor Liddell-Scott have such a specialized sense.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 1:7 or 15:33.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>crush Satan under your feet:</strong> The word <em>crush</em> is used figuratively to refer to completely defeating Satan. The words <em>under your feet</em> indicate that believers will also gain victory over Satan by this deed of God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation will not have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, translate the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>completely defeat Satan for you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Satan:</strong> The word <em>Satan</em> is the Hebrew name of the leader of all the evil spirits. In Hebrew his name means “enemy.” He is the enemy of God and God’s people. Here are some ways to translate <em>Satan</em>:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a local name or idiom that refers to the chief of all demons.</p></li><li><p>Use a descriptive phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the chief/leader of the evil spirits</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the spirit enemy of God</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Borrow the common language word and spell it as someone in your area would say it. If this word is not already known in your area, you may also want to add a descriptive phrase.

Lastly, he said that God should have glory, as a praise to him.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek these verses are all one long sentence. It may be more clear for your readers if you break it up into shorter sentences. There is an example of this in the second meaning lines in the Display. See also the General Comment at the end of 16:27 below.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s Closing Prayer (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Doxology (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Concluding Prayer of Praise (GNT)</p></blockquote></div><h4>16:25a–27</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 16:25–27 there is no main verb. The form of the sentence indicates that Paul was declaring that God should get glory (16:27). The rest of the sentence (16:25–26) describes how God strengthens believers. It is also a reason for declaring that God should have glory (16:27). See the General Comment on 16:25a–27 about how to translate this praise to God which was interrupted by a long description.</p><h4>16:25a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"16:25a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Now to Him who is able to strengthen you</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Now <span data-bnType=\"implied\">glory should go</span> to him who is able to make you stronger <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in faith</span>,</p></li><li><p>¶ So then, there is one who is able to cause you to stand strong even more <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in your believing</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Now:</strong> This introduces Paul’s words of 16:25–27. It does not mean “at the present time.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to Him:</strong> The verb that normally goes before a to-phrase in English does not occur until 16:27: “<u>be</u> glory.” See the General Comment note there.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>strengthen:</strong> This refers to making the believers in Rome strong in their faith. See how you translated this word in 1:11.</p><h4>16:25b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"16:25b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>by my gospel and by the proclamation of Jesus Christ,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>which is in accordance with my gospel, that is, the preaching about Jesus Christ.</p></li><li><p>What I just said is in agreement with the good news that I preach. That good news is the preaching about Jesus Christ.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by my gospel:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>by</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It indicates that the gospel <u>tells us that</u> God strengthens believers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in accordance with the gospel that I preach (NJB) <em>(RSV, NIV11, GNT, NJB, ESV, NABRE, KJV, NASB, NET, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It indicates that the gospel <u>is the means by which</u> God strengthens believers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>by the Good News that I tell people (NCV) <em>(BSB, NIV, GW, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because many English versions support it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are other ways to translate this phrase according to interpretation (1):</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>just as my gospel says</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>my gospel:</strong> This refers to the gospel that Paul preached. It is the gospel (“good news”) about Jesus Christ. This phrase does not imply that Paul preached something different from the other apostles. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Good News that I tell people (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and by the proclamation of Jesus Christ:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>and</em> can also mean “that is.” The word <em>of</em> can mean that Jesus Christ proclaimed or that someone proclaimed about Jesus Christ. These two interpretation issues relate to each other. Here are the two main options:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>That Greek word means <u>that is</u> here and the word <em>of</em> means that <u>someone proclaimed about Jesus Christ</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>which is the message about Jesus Christ (CEV) <em>(NIV11, GNT, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>That Greek word means <u>and</u> here and the word <em>of</em> means that <u>Jesus Christ proclaimed</u>. This seems to be the natural way to take the phrase “preaching of,” which many translations use here. <em>(RSV, ESV, KJV, NASB)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions, like the BSB, have <em>the proclamation of Jesus Christ</em> here (See also NIV, NJB, NABRE, NET, REB). This phrase is similar to “the preaching of Jesus Christ,” but it is not very clear which way to take the <em>of</em> when following <em>proclamation</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). But if the major language version follows interpretation (2), you may want to follow that.</p><h4>16:25c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"16:25c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>according to the revelation of the mystery concealed for ages past</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It is in accordance with the now-revealed mystery that was secret for a very long time</p></li><li><p>It is in agreement with the ages-old secret that</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>according to the revelation of the mystery:</strong> Here the words <em>according to</em> indicate that “my gospel” and “the proclamation of Jesus Christ” is in agreement with this <em>mystery</em> that has now been revealed. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in keeping with the revelation of the mystery (NIV11)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the revelation of the mystery:</strong> The word <em>revelation</em> indicates that what was a <em>mystery</em> has now been understood. Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the mystery…that has now been revealed</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the mystery…that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has now revealed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>mystery:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>mystery</em> refers to truth or knowledge that people have not discovered on their own. Someone else reveals it to them. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>secret (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>hidden truth</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>something that was not made known previously</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 11:25.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>concealed for ages past:</strong> This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> concealed for ages past</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>ages past:</strong> Here the word <em>ages</em> refers to long periods of time. An “age” is often characterized by something. For example: the Bronze Age was the period of time when bronze was the common metal used. The <em>ages</em> here are not named, so just refer to long periods of time, hundreds or even thousands of years. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>long, long periods of time</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>very big groups of years</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Your translation should not use number words like “hundreds” or “thousands,” because this word should be allowed to be very general.</p>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>through the prophetic writings has been made known (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Some languages must have it in its usual place, as the BSB models.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>made known:</strong> This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">he</span> has made known</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>through the writings of the prophets:</strong> Here the word <em>through</em> introduces how the mystery was made known to the nations. God revealed it in these <em>writings</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the writings of the prophets:</strong> This refers to the prophecies that were written in the Hebrew Bible, what many Christians now call the Old Testament.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as the eternal God commanded (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because the eternal God commanded it</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the eternal God:</strong> The word <em>eternal</em> indicates that God always existed in the past and will always exist in the future.</p><h4>16:26d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"16:26d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in order to lead all nations to the obedience that comes from faith—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>for all people groups to obey because of their faith.</p></li><li><p>so that all tribes obey him because they believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in him</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in order to lead…to the obedience that comes from faith:</strong> The words <em>in order to</em> introduce the purpose of Paul’s gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ (16:25b) being made known (16:26b).

It interrupts Paul declaring that God should get glory (“to him…to the only wise God be glory”).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This is one sentence of 52 words in the Greek (and one sentence of 73 words in the BSB). In some languages it is not natural to interrupt the main point with a long description. In some languages a sentence over 50 words long will be hard to understand. If either is true in your language, you may want to translate 16:25a–27 as a number of sentences. You may also want to avoid interrupting the main point. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>25–27</sup>Now, he is able to strengthen you by my gospel and by the proclamation of Jesus Christ. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">That gospel and proclamation</span> are according to the revelation of the mystery that was concealed for ages past but now is revealed. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">That gospel and proclamation</span> have been made known through the writings of the prophets, by the command of the eternal God.
