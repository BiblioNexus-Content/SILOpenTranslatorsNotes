We do not know how Jonah received this message. It could have been in a vision or a dream, or perhaps the LORD spoke directly to him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In Hebrew the story begins abruptly: <em>the word of the LORD came to Jonah</em>. Most English versions follow the Hebrew style. However, in your language it may be necessary to reorder the verse so that the story begins in a more natural way for your readers. Notice that the second meaning line in the Display gives one possible way of doing this. You need to decide which is the best way in your language for introducing this story.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>LORD:</strong> <em>LORD</em> represents the Hebrew Yahweh, the personal name of God. See the notes in the Introduction on how to translate this term.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Jonah son of Amittai:</strong> Jonah was the son of a man called Amittai. Nothing more is recorded about Jonah’s background in this book. 2 Kings 14:25 gives a little more information. The important thing to keep in mind is that he was an Israelite and the LORD told him to deliver a message to the people of Nineveh, who were enemies of the Israelites. In the New Testament, Jesus referred to Jonah as a prophet (Matthew 12:29).</p>",

Go to the great city of Nineveh</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“Go at once to the large city of/called Nineveh</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Get up! Go to the great city of Nineveh:</strong> Nineveh is called a <em>great city</em> because it was very large and many people lived in it. It was so large that it took a person three days to walk through it (3:3). More than 120,000 people lived there (4:11).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Get up! Go to…Nineveh:</strong> In Hebrew this verse begins with two verbs <em>qum</em> and <em>leḵ</em> which literally mean “arise, go.” Some English versions retain the two verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Arise, go to Nineveh (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, when the verb <em>qum</em> is followed by another motion verb, many scholars believe that it has lost its literal meaning and that instead it signals the beginning of an action. In this case it may also signal the urgency of the action. In English versions, you will see this combination of verbs translated in three different ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“Leave at once for Nineveh” (GW) or “Go at once to Nineveh” (NJPS, NRSV). The translators of these versions express the force of <em>qum</em> by the words “at once.” Other ways of doing this in English would be to begin the verse “Start on your way” or “Get going.”</p></li><li><p>The verb <em>qum</em> is not translated at all and the verse is translated as <em>Go to…Nineveh</em> (NIV, GNT, CEV).</p></li><li><p>The verb <em>qum</em> is translated literally: “arise” or “get up” (BSB, KJV, NCV, NJB, NLT, RSV).</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The third option should be avoided because it gives the impression that the LORD was telling Jonah to do two things: “get up” and “go.” It is recommended that you follow one of the translation possibilities suggested in option 1.</p><h4>1:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and preach against it,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and preach <span data-bnType=\"implied\">my message</span> against <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the people</span> there</p></li><li><p>and confront <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the people</span> there <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with my message of judgment</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and preach against it:</strong> The rest of the story shows that what Jonah was told to speak was a message which condemned the people of Nineveh (Keil-Delitzsch, p. 389). Some translations make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>cry out against it (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>go now and denounce it (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>speak against it (TEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>it:</strong> This refers to the city of Nineveh. Although the text says that Jonah was to preach against “the city of Nineveh,” it meant that he was to preach against the people of the city because of the wicked way they were behaving.</p><h4>1:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because its wickedness has come up before Me.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>for it has come to my notice how very wicked they are.”</p></li><li><p>for I know how very wicked they are.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>its wickedness:</strong> Here the wickedness and sinful behavior of the people of Nineveh is referred to as if the city were a person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>has come up before Me:</strong> Or “has come to my attention.” The LORD knew how very sinful the people of Nineveh were.

The LORD had told Jonah to do one thing, but Jonah had decided to do something completely different.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>got up to flee to Tarshish, away from the presence of the LORD:</strong> As an Israelite, Jonah knew that the LORD was everywhere—yet he tried to flee from his presence. So in what sense could he flee from the LORD? Perhaps he thought that by leaving Israel, the country where the LORD’s temple was, and going far away to a country where the people did not follow the LORD, there would be less chance that the LORD would bother him with the command to preach to the people of Nineveh.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to flee to Tarshish:</strong> One thing is certain: Jonah had no intention of obeying the LORD or of going to Nineveh. Instead, he went in the opposite direction, towards the city of Tarshish. This was probably in the country now known as Spain. In Jonah’s time, it was considered to be at the western end of the world. Nineveh, however, was northeast of Israel. Jonah wanted to get as far away from Nineveh and its people as possible, since he did not want to give the LORD’s message to them.</p><h4>1:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He went down to Joppa and found a ship bound for Tarshish.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He went to Joppa <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a city on the sea coast</span>. There he found a ship about to depart for Tarshish.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He went down to Joppa:</strong> Joppa was a city in Israel on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Ships would stop there to pick up passengers and cargo.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>went down:</strong> Jonah went from higher land down to the coast.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and found a ship bound for Tarshish:</strong> There in Joppa, Jonah found a ship which was ready to sail to Tarshish. The sailors (the men who worked on the ship) were not Israelites but were probably from the country of Phoenicia (Clarke, p. 702; Ellison, p. 370).</p><h4>1:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So he paid the fare</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>After he/Jonah had paid the fare,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So he paid the fare:</strong> The text does not tell us to whom Jonah paid the money. If it is necessary in your language to supply this information, you could say, “to the owner of the boat.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>fare:</strong> This refers to the money Jonah paid to travel on the ship.</p><h4>1:3d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:3d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and went aboard to sail for Tarshish,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>he got on it to go with the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">sailors</span> to Tarshish,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and went aboard to sail for Tarshish:</strong> The RSV has: “to go <u>with them</u> to Tarshish.” Most commentators agree that “with them” (omitted by the BSB) refers to the sailors. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>went aboard with the crew to sail to Spain (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, the GNT makes it sound like Jonah and the sailors got on the ship together, that is, at the same time. This may be confusing, since the crew were probably already on the ship.</p><h4>1:3e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:3e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>away from the presence of the LORD.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>for he was <span data-bnType=\"implied\">trying to</span> run away from Yahweh.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>away from the presence of the LORD:</strong> This is the second time this expression has occurred in this verse. See note on 1:3a. The phrase is probably repeated to emphasize it. Most English versions repeat the phrase as the Hebrew text does, although they use different words. For example, compare 1:3a and 1:3e in the CEV.</p>",

If possible, use a term which expresses how violent and sudden the action was. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Lord <u>sent</u> a great wind (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Lord <u>flung</u> a powerful wind (NLT96)</p></blockquote><h4>1:4b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:4b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and such a violent storm arose that the ship was in danger of breaking apart.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>This became a terrible storm, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with the waves hitting the ship with such force</span> that the ship was about to break into pieces.</p></li><li><p>This caused a terrible storm, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and the waves</span> threatened to break the ship in pieces.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and such a violent storm arose that the ship was in danger of breaking apart:</strong> As a result of the strong wind, a fierce storm developed. The waves started to hit against the ship with great force, and the ship was about to break into pieces. It may be necessary in your language to include the information about the waves to explain how the storm affected the boat.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a violent storm:</strong> The Hebrew word which the BSB translates as <em>violent</em> means “great.” You should choose the most natural word in your language to describe a severe storm.</p>",

So because they were afraid, each of them called to the particular god he believed in to help/rescue them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>his own god:</strong> In Jonah, there is a distinction made between “God”—that is, the LORD—and “god/gods.” Notice that the letter “g” in the English spelling of <em>god</em> in this verse is not capitalized. This shows that it is not the LORD, the true God, who is being referred to here. It is possible that these sailors were from different nations and each nationality had its own gods. However, it is more likely that these sailors were all Phoenicians (Ellison p. 370), who believed in many different gods.</p><h4>1:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And they threw the ship’s cargo into the sea to lighten the load.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Then they threw the cargo into the sea to make the ship lighter <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and try to keep it from sinking</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And they threw the ship’s cargo into the sea to lighten the load:</strong> As well as praying to their gods to rescue them, they did their best to help the ship remain floating.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>All this time, Jonah was down below deck, sound asleep (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Most other versions use the connecting word “Meanwhile,” which also makes it clear that Jonah had gone to sleep before the storm.

Notice BSB uses <em>God</em> with a capital “G” because it refers to the true God even though the captain did not yet know that Jonah’s god was the true God. However, since the captain did not know this he probably talked about him as if he were just one of many gods.

The BSB just moves to the next action but in your language it may be necessary to fill in some of the missing steps. Between 1:6 and 1:7, the sailors had noticed that their prayers did not seem to be working. Also, the captain and Jonah had had time to get back to the deck of the ship. Decide whether you need to make any of these steps explicit in your translation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>“Come!”…“Let us cast lots to find out who is responsible for this calamity that is upon us.”:</strong> As the situation became more dangerous and their prayers didn’t work, the sailors decided that the storm had happened because someone on the ship had done something to offend one of the gods. So they decided to cast lots to find out who the guilty person was.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>“Come!”:</strong> You should probably not translate this literally. The Hebrew word here has the sense in English of “come on, let us do something.” GNT and NJPS just omit it.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>cast lots:</strong> People often cast lots to determine the cause of events which puzzle them. The way the lots were actually cast on this occasion is not known. Perhaps the sailors threw dice or drew straws. Another possibility is that each person’s name was written on small tablets or pieces of wood. One of these tablets was then picked at random. The person whose name was on the chosen tablet would be the person who was at fault. You should try, if possible, to use an expression which does not identify a particular method of casting lots.</p><h4>1:7c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:7c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>So they cast lots, and the lot which was chosen indicated that Jonah <span data-bnType=\"implied\">was at fault</span>.</p></li><li><p>So they cast lots, and Jonah was the one chosen by the lot.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the lot fell on Jonah:</strong> Jonah was picked out by lot.

So some English versions have reworded the question. For example, the NRSV asks the <u>reason</u> for the storm: “Tell us why this calamity has come upon us.” However, the way the BSB (as well as the NIV, GNT, RSV, CEV, KJV, NCV) has translated it is the clearest way of understanding the Hebrew, so you should follow these versions.

If you think this is the case, you may want to keep both questions. You need to decide which is most natural in your language, that is, to keep both questions as the BSB has done, or to combine these two sentences into one as the GNT and NLT have done.</p><h4>1:8d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:8d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and who are your people?”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>To which ethnic group do you<sup>(sing)</sup> belong?”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and who are your people?:</strong> Here the sailors wanted to know what ethnic group Jonah was from.

However, they wanted to make sure that the LORD would not punish them for killing Jonah, so they asked to be forgiven even before doing it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Please:</strong> This translates a word in Hebrew which indicates that what follows is a plea or entreaty. It is sometimes translated in older English translations as “we beseech you.” If there is a word or phrase in your language which is used in a situation where someone is begging another person to do something for them, you can use it here.</p><h4>1:14c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:14c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Do not charge us with innocent blood!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We<sup>(excl)</sup> beg you<sup>(sing)</sup>,</span> do not punish us if we are killing an innocent man.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Do not charge us with innocent blood:</strong> The GNT does not translate the word <em>innocent</em>. Instead, it combines this sentence with 1:14b, since it considers 1:14b–c as a doublet. However, most other English versions make a difference between 1:14b and 1:14c, and it is recommended that you do so too.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are two ways to understand this statement:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The sailors were saying that there was a slight chance that Jonah might be innocent. <em>(BSB, NIV, CEV, GW, KJV, NJPS, NJB, REB RSV).</em></p></li><li><p>The sailors were saying that Jonah was guilty. <em>(NCV, NLT)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Although option 2 makes some sense in the context (since Jonah had admitted his guilt), most major commentaries and English versions support the first interpretation (1). It is recommended that you follow the first option too and translate this part of the verse in a way that makes it clear that the sailors still thought that Jonah might be innocent.</p><h4>1:14d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:14d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For You, O LORD, have done as You pleased.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For, O Yahweh, it is you<sup>(sing)</sup> who have caused all of this to happen according to your will.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For You, O LORD, have done as You pleased:</strong> In the sailors’ minds, the LORD was responsible for the whole situation. He had sent the storm and he had indicated through the casting of lots that Jonah was the guilty party. Therefore he was also responsible for them needing to throw Jonah overboard. Therefore they asked the LORD not to blame them for Jonah’s death.</p>",

This showed the sailors that it was the LORD who controlled the storm. As a result, they feared him greatly. The Hebrew verb <em>yaraʾ</em> can mean “to fear” or “to stand in awe of.” With God as the object, it can also mean “to worship,” as it did in 1:9. However, while any of these meanings are possible here, the majority of English versions understand it to mean “fear” or even “terrified.” The addition of the expression “with a great fear” in the Hebrew text here also suggests that “fear” is the correct meaning.</p><h4>1:16b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:16b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and they offered a sacrifice to the LORD</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">So</span> they offered a sacrifice to him</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">So</span> they <span data-bnType=\"implied\">killed an animal</span> as a sacrifice to Yahweh</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they offered a sacrifice to the LORD:</strong> We are not given any details about what kind of sacrifice the sailors made or how it was done.

Then in 2:2d, Jonah switched to the second person “you (sing).” Alternating between the second and third person is a typical pattern in Hebrew, especially in poetry. In some languages this would not be natural or possible. The GNT has used only the second person 2:2 to make it clear that Jonah is addressing his prayer to the LORD.

This does not mean that Jonah had actually died. The term <em>Sheol</em> (Hebrew <em>šeʾol</em>) is often used in the Psalms to refer to immediate danger of death (Kleinert, p. 26). So by using this expression, Jonah was saying that he had felt sure that he was about to die. So he had called to the LORD to rescue him. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>deep in the world of the dead (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I called for help:</strong> This is one word in Hebrew, a synonym for the word translated “called” in 2:2a.</p><h4>2:2d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and You heard my voice.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and you<sup>(sing)</sup> heard my prayer.</p></li><li><p>and you<sup>(sing)</sup> listened to my cry <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for help</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and You heard my voice:</strong> This is parallel to “and He answered me” in 2:2b and means the same thing, that is, the LORD rescued Jonah when he cried to him for help.</p>",

He felt that the LORD was no longer present with him and was no longer caring for him or protecting him (Keil-Delitzsch, p. 401). Notice that what Jonah said or thought in 2:4a–b can be expressed as either direct or indirect speech. (See the Display at 2:4a.) You need to decide which is most natural in your language. Using an indirect quote with the verb “thought,” as the GNT has done, suggests that this was what Jonah was thinking (or saying to himself) in the sea, rather than a prayer he was speaking.</p><h4>2:4b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:4b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>yet I will look once more toward Your holy temple.’</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Yet <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I dared to hope that</span> it might/would be possible for me to see your holy temple once again.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>yet I will look once more toward Your holy temple:</strong> There is a textual problem with this part of the verse. The Hebrew text has the word <em>ʾaḵ</em> which means “yet, surely.” However, scholars disagree about whether to translate this or to follow an alternative text which has <em>ʾeyḵ</em> “how.” So the English versions are divided and there are two choices:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Follow the Hebrew text which has the word <em>ʾaḵ</em> “yet, surely.” In this case, this is an expression of hope and confidence that Jonah would once again see the LORD’s holy temple:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Yet/Surely I will once again look upon/toward your holy temple. <em>(See BSB, NIV, KJV, NCV)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>2.4 Also supported by the LXX; Keil-Delitzsch, p. 401; Kleinert, p. 26.</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Follow the one Greek manuscript which has read the word as <em>ʾeyḵ</em> “how.” In this case, Jonah’s expression is one of hopelessness: he thought he would never see the temple again:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>How can I again look upon/toward your holy temple? <em>(See GNT, CEV, GW, NJB, NJPS, NLT, NRSV, REB)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>2.4 Ellison, p. 377; Stuart, p. 469.</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Although a number of modern translations follow the second option, it has very little textual support. Therefore it is recommended that you follow the first option. Since many modern translations follow the second option, however, it is recommended that you refer to this option in a footnote.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Your holy temple:</strong> The term <em>holy</em> here refers to the fact that this temple is dedicated to the LORD for sacred purposes and belongs to him alone.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Scholars do not agree whether the temple mentioned here (2:4) and the temple mentioned in 2:7 referred to the temple in Jerusalem or to God’s dwelling place in heaven. Avoid referring to the location of the temple in these verses if possible. In both verses, the sense seems to be “the holy place where you (the LORD) live.”</p>",

Jonah may have been referring to a particular group of people—for example, the sailors—or he may have been thinking about anyone who worshiped idols rather than the true God<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>2.8 Ellison, p. 387</span></span>.</p><h4>2:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>forsake His loving devotion.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>will not be shown the grace you<sup>(sing)</sup> wanted to show them.</p></li><li><p>will not receive the kindness you<sup>(sing)</sup> wanted to give them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>forsake His loving devotion:</strong> Literally “they forsake their grace.” This is a very difficult expression in Hebrew. Commentators and translations differ on how they interpret it, depending on how they translate <em>ḥeseḏ</em>, which means “grace, kindness, loyalty, unfailing love,” and what they understand by the expression “<u>their</u> grace.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The two main possibilities are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“their grace” means “the LORD’s grace to them,” that is, the love and kindness which the LORD would have shown them if they had believed in him rather than worshiping idols. <em>(BSB, NIV, CEV, JB, NLT)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>2.8 Allen, p. 215; Sasson, p. 167</span></span></em></p></li><li><p>“their grace” means “the loyalty which they should show to the LORD.” Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>have abandoned their loyalty to you (GNT) <em>(RSV, GW, NCV, NET)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>2.8 Stuart, p. 478; Baldwin, p. 471.</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">There is good support for each of these possibilities. However, in the context, it seems as if Jonah was referring to the pagan sailors. From his point of view, as a Hebrew, people who were not Hebrews had never been “loyal” to the LORD, so how could they “have abandoned their loyalty to” him? The first interpretation makes more sense, therefore, and should be followed. Those who worship idols and follow them forsake the grace they might have obtained from the LORD.</p>",

Notice that the prayer is in the form of poetry. (Both BSB and GNT show this.)

One way in English of showing this contrast is to begin the verse with “But as for me, I…”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with the voice of thanksgiving:</strong> It can refer to either spoken or sung praise. Hence CEV has “shouts of praise” instead of BSB’s <em>voice of thanksgiving</em>. Both are a kind of prayer.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will sacrifice to You:</strong> While Jonah thanked the LORD, he also intended to make a sacrifice to him. Exactly what the sacrifice would be is not mentioned, but, as in 1:16, the Hebrew verb used here usually refers to animal sacrifices.</p><h4>2:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I will fulfill what I have vowed.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The thing I have promised <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you<sup>(sing)</sup></span> I will indeed do,</p></li><li><p>I will indeed do what I promised <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you<sup>(sing)</sup></span> that I would do.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will fulfill what I have vowed:</strong> Here Jonah promised to fulfill the promise/vow he made to the LORD. He made this promise while he was still in the belly of the fish. He had not drowned, but now he needed to be delivered from inside the fish. The text does not tell us what Jonah promised to do. This is similar to the sailors’ reaction to their deliverance in 1:16.</p><h4>2:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Salvation is from the LORD!”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Yahweh is the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">only</span> source of deliverance/salvation/help.”</p></li><li><p>It is Yahweh <span data-bnType=\"implied\">alone</span> who saves/rescues.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Salvation is from the LORD!:</strong> This statement declares that the LORD alone is able to save/rescue. Jonah was stating that the LORD was in control of the situation and could save him. Jonah again referred to the LORD in the third person (see 2:2 and 2:7). However, here it is probably best to keep the third person reference and consider that Jonah was making a statement about the LORD rather than addressing a remark to him. No major English version substitutes a second person reference here.</p>",

Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>perhaps (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>maybe (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God may turn and relent:</strong> There are two problems with this part of the verse.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">First, in Hebrew this expression contains two verbs: <em>šuḇ</em> “to turn” and <em>naḥam</em> “to be sorry, have compassion, repent.” There are two ways of understanding this double verb structure:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The two verbs should be translated as one single action. The second verb <em>naḥam</em> “to be sorry, have compassion, repent” is the main verb. The other verb <em>šuḇ</em>, literally “to turn,” is often used in Hebrew as an auxiliary verb with the meaning of “do something again.” This can be expressed in a translation by the word “again” or even omitted when the main verb already contains the idea of repeated action. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>change his mind (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>reconsider his plans (GW) <em>(RSV, CEV, NCV, NET, NLT, REB)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>3.9 Sasson, p. 240 and Stuart, p. 494.</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The two verbs represent two separate actions. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>relent and change his mind (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>turn and relent (NJPS) <em>(BSB, NIV, KJV, NJB)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>3.9 See also Baldwin, p. 578.</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow the first option (1) here. The verb <em>šuḇ</em> is often used as an adverb in Hebrew, and the adverbial sense of “doing something again” fits well with the range of meaning of the second verb <em>naḥam</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The second problem about which scholars and versions differ is the meaning of <em>naḥam</em> in this context. The two main possibilities are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It should be translated “to change his mind, relent, repent”. <em>(BSB, TEV, CEV, GW, KJV, NCV, NET, NJB, NJPS, NRSV, REB)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>3.9 Sasson, p. 240; Stuart, p.494</span></span></em></p></li><li><p>It should be translated “to have compassion, to be moved with pity”. <em>(NIV, NLT)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>3.9 Baldwin, p. 578</span></span></em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Both are possible meanings of <em>naḥam</em> and both make sense in the context. However, the first meaning, “change his mind,” goes best with the use of <em>šuḇ</em> as an auxiliary verb. Also these are the words of the pagan king of Nineveh, who had little knowledge of the compassionate God of Jonah. His interest was mainly in causing God to change his mind about destroying his city. For these reasons the first option is recommended (1).</p><h4>3:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He may turn from His fierce anger,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and stop being so angry <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with us<sup>(incl)</sup></span></p></li><li><p>and his terrible anger <span data-bnType=\"implied\">against us<sup>(incl)</sup></span> will stop</p></li></ul></div><h4>3:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that we will not perish.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so we<sup>(incl)</sup> will not die.”</p></li><li><p>so <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he</span> will not destroy us<sup>(incl)</sup>.”</p></li></ul></div>",

He had feared that if he went to preach to the people of Nineveh, they might repent of their evil ways and the LORD would not destroy them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a rhetorical question; Jonah was complaining. If you cannot use rhetorical questions in your language when you complain about something, you will need to use a statement instead. See 4:2b in the Display for examples of both options.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>while I was still in my own country:</strong> Here Jonah was referring to his home country, Israel.</p><h4>4:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>This is why I was so quick to flee toward Tarshish.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>That is why I <span data-bnType=\"implied\">tried to</span> run away <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from you<sup>(sing)</sup></span> and go to Tarshish <span data-bnType=\"implied\">instead</span>.</p></li><li><p>That is why I was in such a hurry to flee <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the opposite direction</span> to Tarshish.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>This is why I was so quick to flee toward Tarshish:</strong> Since Jonah wanted Israel’s enemies to be destroyed, he did not want the LORD to spare Nineveh. So rather than give them the chance to repent, he ran away to Tarshish.</p><h4>4:2d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:2d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I knew that You are a gracious and compassionate God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For I knew that you<sup>(sing)</sup> are a kind and merciful God,</p></li><li><p>Because I knew that you<sup>(sing)</sup> are kind and compassionate,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I knew that You are a gracious and compassionate God:</strong> In Hebrew, this part of the verse begins with the connecting word <em>kiy</em> “for.” Although the BSB and a number of other versions have omitted it, it is an important connection. Jonah ran away <u>because</u> he knew God was kind and would forgive the people of Nineveh if they believed God’s message through Jonah and repented from their sins. You should make sure this relationship is clear in your translation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a gracious and compassionate God:</strong> The two adjectives used here, <em>ḥannun</em> (<em>gracious</em>) and <em>raḥum</em> (<em>compassionate</em>), are usually only used to refer to God.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>gracious:</strong> This means that God is kind to those who are evil and who are his enemies. Because he is <em>gracious</em>, he treats them with kindness even though such people do not deserve such treatment from him.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>compassionate:</strong> This means that God shows pity to those who suffer and is merciful to those who do not deserve mercy.</p><h4>4:2e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:2e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>slow to anger,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>you<sup>(sing)</sup> are slow to become angry,</p></li><li><p>you<sup>(sing)</sup> do not get angry quickly <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with people</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>slow to anger:</strong> The Hebrew expression here has two aspects: first, someone who does not get angry easily or quickly, and, second, someone who is even-tempered and patient (UBS Handbook, p. 105). Since there is no English word that includes both aspects in its meaning, English versions handle this expression in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>They emphasize “not getting angry quickly”. This can be expressed positively as “slow to get angry,” or negatively as “not quick to get angry.” <em>(BSB, NIV, RSV, NET, NCV, NJB, NJPS, NLT)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>4.2 Baldwin, p. 582</span></span></em></p></li><li><p>They emphasize “being patient”. <em>(TEV, CEV, GW)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>4.2 Stuart, p. 498; Sasson, p. 270</span></span></em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow the first option, unless your term for “patient” includes the idea of someone who doesn’t get easily angered.</p><h4>4:2f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:2f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>abounding in loving devotion—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and your<sup>(sing)</sup> unfailing love is great.</p></li><li><p>and you<sup>(sing)</sup> never stop showing great love <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to people</span>.</p></li><li><p>and your<sup>(sing)</sup> love is great and continues forever.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>abounding in loving devotion:</strong> The Hebrew word translated here as <em>loving devotion</em> is <em>ḥeseḏ</em>. See how you translated the same word in 2:8b. This word often contains the meaning, “faithfulness, loyalty, steadfastness.” Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>steadfast love (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>loyal love (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>unfailing love (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The same list of God’s attributes in 4:2d–f, that is, “gracious,” “compassionate,” “slow to anger,” and <em>abounding in loving devotion</em>, is also found in Exodus 34:6, Nehemiah 9:17, Psalm 86:15, Psalm 103:8, Psalm 145:8, and Joel 2:13.</p><h4>4:2g</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:2g\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>One who relents from sending disaster.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You<sup>(sing)</sup> are a God</span> who <span data-bnType=\"implied\">can</span> change your mind about destroying people.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You<sup>(sing)</sup> are a God</span> who does not want to destroy people.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>One who relents from sending disaster:</strong> This aspect of God’s character is not found in the other lists mentioned above because it is specific to Jonah’s situation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>relents from sending disaster:</strong> This is literally “changes his mind about the evil” and is the same expression as was found in 3:10c. They should be translated the same way in both places.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>relents:</strong> This verb is again <em>naḥam</em>. See the discussion on this verb in 3:9a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The idea that the LORD could change his mind and not destroy people was not a comforting thought to Jonah because he had hoped that the LORD would destroy the people of Nineveh.</p>",

The Hebrew verb <em>minneh</em> used here is the same one that was translated <em>appointed</em> in 1:17a. There the LORD provided a great fish to save Jonah, now he provided a plant to shelter him. The rapid growth of this plant indicates that this was miraculous.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the LORD God:</strong> In the book of Jonah, God is usually called <em>the LORD</em> (Yahweh) or <em>God</em> (<em>ʾelohim</em>), although in chapter 2 he is called “the LORD his God” and “the LORD my God.” Here the two names for God are joined together without any pronoun. The use of <em>LORD God</em> without a possessive pronoun is fairly rare in the OT. It is found mainly in Genesis 2–3 and in 1 and 2 Chronicles. How you translate this phrase will depend on the term you have chosen for Yahweh. See the note in the Introduction.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>vine:</strong> The word translated <em>vine</em> by BSB<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>4.6 See also the NIV; CEV</span></span> only occurs in this passage in the OT and no one has been able to identify for certain what sort of plant is being referred to.

You should use as generic a term as possible for “plant” in your translation here rather than using the name of a specific plant from your area which possibly did not grow in Nineveh. The important thing about this plant is that it was leafy and provided enough shade to protect Jonah’s head and to ease the discomfort he was experiencing from the hot sun. This made Jonah very happy.</p><h4>4:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to provide shade over Jonah’s head to ease his discomfort,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>over Jonah’s head to shelter him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from the sun</span> and make him less uncomfortable.</p></li></ul></div><h4>4:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and Jonah was greatly pleased with the plant.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Jonah was delighted because of the plant.</p></li><li><p>Jonah was very pleased because the plant <span data-bnType=\"implied\">was there to shelter him from the sun</span>.</p></li></ul></div>",

This was to show Jonah how much the LORD cared about people—even the enemies of the Israelites.</p></div><h4>4:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>When dawn came the next day, God appointed a worm</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ However, the next day at dawn, God sent a worm,</p></li></ul></div><h4>4:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that attacked the plant so that it withered.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>which chewed the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">stem/root of the</span> plant and caused it to wither.</p></li><li><p>which gnawed on the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">stem/root of the</span> plant so that it died.</p></li></ul></div><h4>4:7a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>When dawn came the next day, God appointed a worm that attacked the plant so that it withered:</strong> Jonah’s relief only lasted one day, because the next day God sent a worm which chewed the vine so that it withered and died. Then there was no longer enough shade to protect Jonah from the burning sun.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>God appointed a worm:</strong> The Hebrew verb <em>minneh</em> translated here as <em>appointed</em> is the same word as in 1:17a and 4:6a. See the notes on those verses. The same verb also occurs in 4:8a. In each case God “provided” something which affected Jonah. In all four verses the BSB uses <em>appointed</em>. If you can use the same verb in the four verses, you should do so. The important thing in each case was that God initiated the action and was in control.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>worm:</strong> Scholars have suggested a number of possible translations for the Hebrew term translated <em>worm</em> in the BSB and most other English versions. Some other suggestions are: larva, maggot, weevil, beetle, or centipede<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>4.7 Sasson, p. 301</span></span>. If possible, use a general word for this creature, one that refers to something that eats stems or leaves.</p>",
