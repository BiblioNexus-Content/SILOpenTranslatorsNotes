In this introduction, Paul followed the customs of that time for writing a letter. The custom was to put the writer’s name first and then write the names of the people to whom the letter was sent. After that the writer greeted them with a wish for their well-being. So, Paul began this letter with his own name in 1:1. Then in 1:2 he mentioned the people to whom he was sending the letter. In 1:3 he greeted these people with a wish for their well-being. Among Christians, this wish was often a prayer for God’s blessing.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In this section, Paul briefly introduced two main themes of his letter.</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>It was God and Jesus who had made Paul an apostle. It was not other people who had called him to become an apostle. That gave him very high authority. This authority is one of the themes of his letter, and he discussed it more fully in chapter 2.</p></li><li><p>In 1:4, Paul reminded the Galatians that we Christians are saved because Jesus died for our sins. The main theme of the whole letter to the Galatians is that we are saved by the grace of God and by believing in Jesus.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other possible headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Greeting</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Greetings from Paul</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Paul, an apostle—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ From Paul, an apostle.

He did not use a verb. But you may need to add a verb to help your readers understand that Paul was the person who wrote the letter. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This letter is from Paul (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I,</span> Paul, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">am writing this letter</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to you</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>an apostle:</strong> The word <em>apostle</em> refers to a person whom someone sends with his authority. He sends him to give a message or to accomplish a particular task. Here, the word <em>apostle</em> refers to a man whom Jesus chose and gave authority. After Jesus returned to heaven, his apostles were the leaders of the people who believed in him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you have already translated the Gospels, you can probably use the same term for apostle as you used there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate <em>apostle</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">special</span> messenger</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a representative</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a person with authority <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from Jesus</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a chief leader <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Jesus’s work</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also apostle in the Glossary for more information.</p><h4>1:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>sent not from men nor by man,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">My call to be an apostle</span> did not come from men. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">It</span> did not come/pass through a man/mediator.</p></li><li><p>Men did not commission <span data-bnType=\"implied\">me</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be an apostle</span>.

It was not through a middle man <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that Jesus</span> chose me.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>sent:</strong> In Greek, there is no verb in 1:1b. Many languages may need to supply a verb here as the BSB does. Here are some other examples of English versions that supply a verb here:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>not <u>sent</u> from men (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was not <u>chosen</u> to be an apostle by human beings (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was not <u>appointed</u> by any group (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whose call to be an apostle did not <u>come</u> from human beings (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not from men nor by man:</strong> There are at least two ways to interpret these two phrases:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The focus is on the difference in meaning indicated by the <u>two prepositions</u> <em>from</em> and <em>by</em>. According to this interpretation, the phrase <em>not from men</em> means that no human being chose/commissioned Paul to be an apostle. The phrase <em>nor by man</em> means that there was no intermediary between God/Jesus and Paul when he chose/commissioned Paul to be an apostle. On the road to Damascus, Jesus spoke directly to Paul without going through any human being. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It was not men who made me an apostle. It was not an intermediary who made me an apostle.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Adapted from the French version Parole de Vie: “Ce ne sont pas des hommes qui m’ont fait apôtre. Je ne le suis pas par l’intermédiaire d’un homme….”</span></span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The focus is on the <u>plural and singular nouns</u> <em>men</em> and <em>man</em>. According to this interpretation, the first phrase means that no group of men (such as the church in Antioch or Jerusalem) chose/commissioned Paul to be an apostle. The second phrase means that no individual man (such as Ananias, Peter, Barnabas, or James) chose/commissioned him to be an apostle. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>chosen not by any group or individual (GW)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This is the interpretation that most English commentaries follow.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example, Moo says that the two phrases have “sparked discussion because of the way Paul shifts the wording. He moves from the preposition <em>apo</em> to <em>dia</em> and from the plural <em>anthropon</em> to the singular <em>anthropou</em>. The latter change may signal a move from general to particular: Paul does not owe his apostolic status to ‘human beings’ in general; nor does he owe it to any particular human being—perhaps someone such as James or Peter (e.g., Martyn 1007:84). Such a distinction is possible, but it is perhaps more likely that the shift from plural to singular is simply stylistic. The change from <em>apo</em> to <em>dia</em> might also be stylistic, since the two prepositions have a semantic overlap in the idea of ‘ultimate origin’…. However, <em>dia</em> more often refers to an intermediate agent: ‘through’ rather than ‘from’ or ‘by’….Paul therefore is probably making two slightly different points in these phrases: the ultimate source of his apostleship was not human; nor did he receive it from, or through, any human being (‘source’ vs. ‘agency’)…. This interpretation fits Paul’s general use of the two prepositions…and satisfactorily explains why he uses both phrases” (pages 67–68).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate these phrases are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">My call to be an apostle did</span> not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">come</span> from men. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">It did not come</span> through an intermediary</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Men did not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">commission me to be an apostle</span>. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus</span> did not use an intermediary <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to chose/appoint me</span>.</p></blockquote><h4>1:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but by Jesus Christ and God the Father,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Rather, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">it</span> came <span data-bnType=\"implied\">directly</span> from Jesus Christ and God the Father.</p></li><li><p>Instead Jesus Christ and God the Father <span data-bnType=\"implied\">commissioned/chose me</span>.</p></li><li><p>It was Jesus the Christ and God the Father <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who chose me</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but:</strong> There is a contrast here. The contrast is between those (in 1:1b) who did not send Paul and God, who did send him. Languages have different ways to indicate this negative-positive type of contrast.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>One of the functions of the Greek conjunction <em>ἀλλά</em> is to signal this negative-positive type of contrast.</span></span> Some of the ways are:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>With the conjunction “but.”</p></li><li><p>With a conjunction other than “but.” This is a common way in English to show this type of contrast. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>rather</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>on the contrary</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>instead</p></blockquote></li><li><p>With no conjunction. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>b</sup>I was not chosen to be an apostle by human beings, nor was I sent from human beings. <sup>c</sup>I was made an apostle through Jesus Christ… (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by Jesus Christ and God the Father:</strong> This phrase means that Paul was chosen and sent through/by Jesus Christ and God the Father. His authority as an apostle came directly from God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>by Jesus Christ himself and by God the Father (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I was chosen to be an apostle by Jesus Christ and by God the Father (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Jesus Christ and God the Father <span data-bnType=\"implied\">chose me</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be an apostle</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Jesus Christ:</strong> In the phrase <em>Jesus Christ</em>, <em>Jesus</em> is a personal name, and <em>Christ</em> is his title. Christ is not the surname of Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">One way to show this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Jesus the Christ/Messiah</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, people say the title before the name. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Christ Jesus</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Christ:</strong> The title <em>Christ</em> is the Greek translation of the Hebrew word “Messiah.” The Jews used this title to refer to the person whom God had appointed and promised to send as king and savior.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate <em>Christ</em> are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a title or a descriptive phrase in your language that has the same meaning as <em>Christ</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Messiah</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Promised Deliverer</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Rescuer/Ruler whom God appointed</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Transliterate <em>Christ</em> and include a phrase that explains the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ, the appointed one</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Cristo, the Savior whom God promised to send</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ, he comes from God</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Transliterate <em>Christ</em> and indicate in some way that it is a title. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Kirisita</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">If you do not indicate the meaning of <em>Christ</em> in the text, you may want to include a footnote to explain it. Or you may want to explain the meaning in a glossary. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The word/title “Christ” refers to the one whom God had promised to send. He would be both king/ruler and savior.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>God the Father:</strong> In some languages, it may be more natural to translate <em>God the Father</em> as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Father God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God our Father</p></blockquote><h4>1:1d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who raised Him from the dead—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It is he</span> who raised him from death.</p></li><li><p>He made Jesus to live again.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who raised Him from the dead:</strong> This is a relative clause. In some languages, a literal translation of this relative clause may imply a wrong meaning. It may imply that there is one God who raised Jesus from the dead, and another God who did not raise Jesus. If this is true in your language, you should translate this clause as a separate sentence. For example</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He raised Him from the dead</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He made Jesus to live again</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:1b–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to change the order of some of the clauses in 1:1b–d. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1c</sup>I was chosen to be an apostle by Jesus Christ and by God the Father, <sup>1d</sup>who raised him from death. <sup>1b</sup>No mere human chose or appointed me to this work. (CEV)</p></blockquote></div>",

This greeting was like a prayer or a blessing. Paul prayed to God and asked him to bless the Galatians.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In Greek, this greeting has no verb. In some languages, it may be more natural to add a verb. (The verbs are underlined below.) For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ <u>give</u> you grace and peace. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I pray that</span> God our<sup>(incl)</sup> Father and the Lord Jesus Christ will <u>bless</u> you<sup>(plur)</sup> with his favor. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I pray that he will</span> <u>give</u> you<sup>(plur)</sup> peace <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in your hearts</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages translate the words <em>Grace</em> and <em>peace</em> as long phrases. If that is true in your language, you may want to use something shorter in this greeting. Here Paul was not actually teaching about grace and peace. So it may not be necessary to include all the elements normally associated with these terms.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Grace:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Grace</em> refers to kindness that is shown to people freely. In this context, the word refers to God’s grace. He is kind to people because he loves them. People have not done anything to deserve his kindness.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>kindness</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>generous help</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>favor</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also grace, Meaning 1 in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>peace:</strong> The Jewish concept of <em>peace</em> includes both an absence of war and a state of well-being, safety, health, and economic prosperity. All this comes from God for those who are in a relationship with him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages may have one word to describe the absence of war or conflict. These languages may have a different word to describe a general state of well-being or an inner peace of the heart. If that is the case, choose the word that describes a state of wholeness or well-being.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:</strong> There is a textual issue here.

In this introduction, Paul followed the customs of that time for writing a letter. The custom was to put the writer’s name first and then write the names of the people to whom the letter was sent. After that the writer greeted them with a wish for their well-being. So, Paul began this letter with his own name in 1:1. Then in 1:2 he mentioned the people to whom he was sending the letter. In 1:3 he greeted these people with a wish for their well-being. Among Christians, this wish was often a prayer for God’s blessing.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In this section, Paul briefly introduced two main themes of his letter.</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>It was God and Jesus who had made Paul an apostle. It was not other people who had called him to become an apostle. That gave him very high authority. This authority is one of the themes of his letter, and he discussed it more fully in chapter 2.</p></li><li><p>In 1:4, Paul reminded the Galatians that we Christians are saved because Jesus died for our sins. The main theme of the whole letter to the Galatians is that we are saved by the grace of God and by believing in Jesus.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other possible headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Greeting</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Greetings from Paul</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1049001003\" data-endVerseId=\"1049001005\"><h3>Paragraph 1:3–5</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, Paul asked God to bless the Galatians.

It connects verses 3 and 4. In some languages, it may be natural to make this connection by starting a new sentence that has Jesus as the subject. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jesus gave himself for our sins (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>gave Himself:</strong> This phrase means that Jesus “voluntarily gave his life,” “willingly died,” or “chose to die” on the cross.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Christ…gave himself as a sacrifice (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He yielded/surrendered his life</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Jesus was willing to be punished and killed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for our sins:</strong> This phrase means “to pay for our sins” or “to take the punishment for our sins.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>on account of our sins</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that our sins might be forgiven</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sins:</strong> The word <em>sins</em> means the things that we do when we disobey God’s standard of what is right or good. Sins include acts, thoughts, and attitudes that are not what God wants or approves. A person can also sin by not doing what God wants him to do.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a general term that can include any wrongdoing against God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>disobedience</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wrong acts</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>offenses <span data-bnType=\"implied\">against God</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>evil deeds</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to translate the word <em>sins</em> with a phrase that includes a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wrong things that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we</span> have done</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are problems to avoid:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The term should not imply that only crimes like murder or stealing are sins.

He also used it to refer to the evil way that people lived during this period. In this context, this phrase focuses on the sinful and wicked way of life in our world.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the sinful way that people live in this world</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>this evil that is in this world</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the wickedness that is now on the earth</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the evil ways in which human beings think and act (SSA)</p></blockquote><h4>1:4c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:4c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>according to the will of our God and Father,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He did this to obey/follow</span> the will of God our<sup>(incl)</sup> Father</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He did this</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because that is what</span> our<sup>(incl)</sup> Father God wanted <span data-bnType=\"implied\">him to do</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>according to the will of our God and Father:</strong> This clause gives the background and reason for Jesus giving his life to set us free (in 1:4a–b).

It does not refer to two different beings.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Only the KJV translates the Greek phrase <em>theou kai patros humon</em> literally as “God and <u>our</u> Father.” Some versions say “God our Father” (CEV, NLT) or “God the Father” (NCV), perhaps to avoid giving the impression that God and Father are not one and the same. All other versions understand the pronoun <em>our</em> to go with both God and Father, i.e. “our God and Father.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God our Father (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>our God, who is our Father</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>our Father God</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:4a–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to change the order of the clauses in this verse.

In order to do this, the order of some of the clauses in 1:6 will have to be changed.

In this context it is unfavorable.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul had expected the Galatian believers to remain faithful to the true gospel. It was hard for him to believe that they were deserting the gospel. Translate this verb in a way that expresses a bad surprise. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I am dismayed/disappointed</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I am shocked (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I am very surprised</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>how quickly you are deserting:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>deserting</em> here refers to switching from one side/team to another. Here it refers to a change of religious belief and practice. It indicates that the Galatians had started “turning away from” or “abandoning” the true gospel. The Greek tense of this verb indicates that the “turning away” was not yet complete.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>how quickly</em> indicates that the Galatians started to turn away from the gospel soon after Paul had taught it to them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that you are turning away so soon (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that you are so soon turning your backs on</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that you are so quickly changing your minds and abandoning/leaving</p></blockquote><h4>1:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who called you by the grace of Christ</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>who called you<sup>(plur)</sup> to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">live/experience</span> the kindness of Christ</p></li><li><p>who called you to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">experience/know</span> Christ’s kindness.</p></li><li><p>He invited you to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">experience/feel/taste</span> the good/kind things that Christ does for us.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who called you by the grace of Christ:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is a textual issue in this clause. In some Greek manuscripts, this clause includes the Greek word for “Christ.” (1) Most English versions follow the Greek manuscripts that <u>include the word Christ</u>. For example: who called you by the grace of Christ (NIV) (BSB, NIV, GNT, ESV, NET, RSV, KJV, NASB, NJB, GW, NLT, JBP)(2) Some English versions follow Greek manuscripts that <u>do not include the word Christ</u>. For example: who called you by grace (REB) (REB, CEV)It is recommended that you follow option (1) and the majority of English versions.</span></span> There are at least two ways to interpret the phrase that the BSB translates as <em>by the grace of Christ</em>.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to the <u>purpose</u> for which God called us. God called us so that we should live in the grace of Christ.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The rendering “live in the grace of Christ” is supported by other uses of the Greek word translated “call” in connection with the Greek preposition meaning “in” or “with.” Compare with 1 Corinthians 7:15, where many English versions supply the word “live” to fill out the Greek phrase that may be literally translated “called you/us in(to) peace.” Note also 1 Thessalonians 4:7, where again the Greek phrase literally translated is “called in(to) holiness,” but some versions add the word “live” to make the meaning clearer in English.</span></span> In other words, God called the Galatians to experience Christ’s kindness. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>called you to live in the grace of Christ (NIV11) <em>(NIV11, KJV)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This interpretation is supported by Moo, p. 77; Fung, p. 44, Burton, p. 21, Schreiner, p. 85, and Rogers, p. 22.</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to the <u>means</u> by which God called us. God called us through/by the grace of Christ. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>called you by the grace of Christ (NIV) <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, NET, NASB, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Interpretation (1) has more commentary support than interpretation (2). Many English versions literally translate this phrase as “in the grace of Christ.” So they may also be following interpretation (1), but that is not certain.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">When you translate 1:6b, you may want to use the NIV11 as your source text. It says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>called you to live in the grace of Christ (NIV11)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here the word “live” is used in a figurative sense.

Here this phrase also introduces an exception.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Moo says, “The other gospel to which the Galatians are tempted to transfer their allegiance is a gospel only in the sense that some ‘agitators’…are claiming it to be a gospel” (p. 79).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to connect 1:7a and 1:7b are:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use the word <u>except</u>. This option probably follows the Greek most closely. It introduces 1:7b as an exception to 1:7a.

(GW)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>some people are troubling you:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>troubling</em> also means “confuse.” This verb is in the present tense. When Paul wrote this letter, some men (who were false teachers) were in the process of trying to confuse the Galatians.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>some people are confusing you (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You are being fooled by those… (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>some people are causing you trouble (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>1:7c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:7c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and trying to distort the gospel of Christ.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and trying to change the gospel of Christ.

The true gospel is the only gospel. It is more important than any person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">No one, including Paul, may change the gospel. Paul said that God would curse anyone who would change the gospel. He emphasized this by stating a situation that was not real. Neither Paul nor the brothers with him had preached a different gospel to the Galatians.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This contrasts with the real situation of the false teachers who were teaching a false gospel. Paul was warning those who were listening to the false teachers.</p><h4>1:8</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Before you translate 1:8, carefully consider what is the most natural order in your language for the clauses in this verse. In some languages, it may be more natural to change the order of some of the clauses. Compare the order of the clause in the BSB and GW:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>a</sup>But even if we or an angel from heaven <sup>b</sup>should preach a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, <sup>c</sup>let him be under a curse! (BSB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>b</sup>Whoever tells you good news that is different from the Good News we gave you <sup>c</sup>should be condemned to hell, <sup>a</sup>even if he is one of us or an angel from heaven.

The contrast is between the “gospel of Christ” that Paul preached and the “different gospel” that some men were preaching. With this contrast, Paul continued to show that there is only one gospel.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions indicate this contrast with the conjunction <em>But</em>. Other English versions do not translate this conjunction here. However, the contrast is still shown by the expressions for the true gospel and the false gospel.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>even if:</strong> The phrase <em>even if</em> introduces a situation that is not real. The following situation never happened. The Greek grammar clearly shows that what follows is a hypothetical statement.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>suppose</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>consider/imagine <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the false situation in which</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">but we have not done that</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we:</strong> The pronoun <em>we</em> refers to Paul and his companions. Paul used it to emphasize that he himself is included. This pronoun does not include the Galatians.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>an angel from heaven:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>angel</em> means “messenger.” It can be either a human messenger or a divine messenger. The phrase <em>from heaven</em> shows that here it refers to a divine messenger.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here, <em>heaven</em> is a figure of speech that represents God who lives in heaven. So the phrase <em>angel from heaven</em> refers to a “messenger from heaven” or “messenger from God.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this phrase are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a descriptive word or phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>messenger from heaven/God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">good/holy</span> spirit-being from above</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a local term that fits the biblical meaning. If you use a term for angel that people cannot confuse with an ordinary messenger, then it would not be necessary to add <em>from heaven</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>angel</p></blockquote></li><li><p>In some areas the churches may already be using a borrowed term or a transliterated word for <em>angel</em>. Be sure that this term fits the biblical meaning. If some people do not understand the right meaning from this term, you may need to indicate the meaning with a descriptive phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>an <u>angelos</u> messenger from heaven</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a sacred <u>angelos</u> spirit from above</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Be sure that your term for <em>angel</em> is different from your terms for “prophet” and “apostle.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">See also angel in the Glossary for more information.</p><h4>1:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>should preach a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>preach to you<sup>(plur)</sup> a gospel that is different than the gospel that we had preached to you<sup>(plur)</sup>,</p></li><li><p>teach you<sup>(plur)</sup> a message that is not the same as good news that we<sup>(excl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">first</span> taught you,</p></li><li><p>teach you something that does not agree with the good news that we <span data-bnType=\"implied\">first</span> taught you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>should preach a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>contrary to</em> can also be translated as “that is opposed to” or “that does not agree with.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>should preach to you a gospel that is different from the one we preached to you (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>should preach/teach you a doctrine that does not agree with the gospel we already taught you</p></blockquote><h4>1:8c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:8c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>let him be under a curse!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>let/may that person be cursed.</p></li><li><p>may <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> curse/punishment fall on that person.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">If that should happen,</span> I pray that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will punish/destroy that person.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>let him be under a curse:</strong> This clause is a type of prayer.

There were false teachers who were teaching the Galatians a false gospel. The believers were deserting the true gospel to follow that false gospel. Paul used the clauses in 1:9a to draw attention to how serious the situation was in Galatia. He used very strong language to condemn the false teachers.</p><h4>1:9a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>As we have said before, so now I say again:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I say again what we have said before: (NLT)</p></li><li><p>We<sup>(excl)</sup> said this before, and now I say it again:</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>As we have said before, so now I say again:</strong> There are two ways to interpret these two clauses:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to a message that Paul had given on a previous visit to Galatia.</p></li><li><p>It refers to the curse Paul has just pronounced in 1:8.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most commentators believe that Paul was referring to what he and Barnabas had told the Galatians on a previous visit.

It is no longer a hypothetical statement about what “we or an angel” might do. Instead, it is a statement about what some people were actually doing.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">To make this clear, it may be better in some languages to begin this clause with something other than <em>If</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Whoever is preaching to you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>may anybody who preaches (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>anyone who preaches (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a gospel contrary to the one you received:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>contrary to</em> is the same word as in 1:8b.

He did this in several ways:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>He rebuked them for turning away from the true gospel.</p></li><li><p>He condemned anyone who proclaimed any other gospel.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">At this point in most of Paul’s other letters, he thanked God for his readers. The fact that he does not do that in Galatians shows how concerned and upset he was.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other possible headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not follow false teaching</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not turn away from the true gospel</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Follow the Good News We Gave You (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>There Is No Other Gospel (NRSV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Am I now seeking the approval of men, or of God?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Am I saying this</span> now because I am trying to win the approval of people or <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to win the approval</span> of God?</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Does what I</span> just <span data-bnType=\"implied\">said show that</span> I am trying to please people? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">No,</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am trying to please</span> God.</p></li><li><p>¶ I am not trying to please people. I want to please God. (CEV)</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In 1:10 Paul explained why he had the authority to speak so harshly in 1:6–9. He was Christ’s servant, and he was trying to please God, not men. He said this because he wanted the Galatians to have confidence that he taught the true gospel. Some English versions introduce this explanation by translating the Greek conjunction at the start of the verse. (See next note.) Some other ways to introduce it are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I speak like this</span> because</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When I speak like this</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Does what I just said show</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse begins with a Greek conjunction that is often translated as “for.” Some English versions, such as the ESV, translate it that way. The BSB has not translated this conjunction, and some other versions, such as the NIV and NET, also do not translate it. Connect 1:10a to 1:9c in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Am I now seeking the approval of men, or of God:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. Paul used this rhetorical question to emphasize that he was <u>not</u> trying to win the approval of people. He was seeking the approval of God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this emphasis are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a rhetorical question or questions. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Am I saying this now to win the approval of people or God? (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Am I trying to please people? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">If not that,</span> am I trying to please God?</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a rhetorical question followed by a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Does this sound as if I am trying to win human approval? No indeed! What I want is God’s approval! (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do you think I am trying to make people accept me? No, God is the One I am trying to please. (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As two statements. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am not trying to please people. I want to please God. (CEV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use the most natural form in your language to emphasize that Paul is not trying to win the approval of people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>now:</strong> This word shows that Paul was referring to what he had just said in 1:6–9.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Am I saying this now (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Does what I <u>just</u> said show</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When I speak <u>like this</u></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>seeking the approval of:</strong> In this context, the Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>seeking the approval of</em> also means “try to please.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Normally this word means “persuade” (as in the KJV). In this context, it is best to consider this word to be close in meaning to the next verb phrase, “seeking to please.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this verb are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>trying to please (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>seeking the favor of (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>trying to make people accept me (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>trying to make people praise me</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>men:</strong> The word <em>men</em> refers to people in general.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>man</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>human beings</p></blockquote><h4>1:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Or am I striving to please men?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Do you think I am trying to please people? (CEV)</p></li><li><p>I am not trying to please people,</p></li><li><p>I am not trying to get people to praise me,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Or am I striving to please men?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. Paul used this rhetorical question to further emphasize that he did not try to please people. This question is similar to the first part of the rhetorical question in 1:10a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this emphasis are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do you think I am trying to please people? (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am most certainly not trying to please men.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a natural way in your language to emphasize that Paul did not try to please people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural to combine this rhetorical question with the first part of the rhetorical question in 1:10a. For example, the NLT translates both 1:10a and 1:10b as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Obviously, I’m not trying to win the approval of people, but of God. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Your solution to this issue depends on how your language uses repetition. If repetition adds emphasis, then you may keep both rhetorical questions. But if it is bad style or adds confusion, then it is enough to say this once and use other means to show the emphasis. Paul wanted to emphasize that it is God he wants to please rather than people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Or:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Or</em> here introduces a question that repeats the first part of the question in 1:10a. It does not indicate an alternative situation. Some English versions do not translate this word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Am I trying to please people? (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>men:</strong> As in 1:10a, the word <em>men</em> refers to people in general. Translate it in the same way.</p><h4>1:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>If I were still trying/seeking to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">because</span> if I were still doing that, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">but I’m not,</span> then I would not be a servant of Christ.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ:</strong> This is a conditional sentence. (A conditional sentence is a sentence with an “if” clause.) Paul used this conditional sentence to state the opposite of what was true. He did this to emphasize the truth. The truth is that he was no longer trying to please people, because he had become a servant of Christ. Before Paul became a Christian, he did try to please people. But then he became a servant of Christ. So he was no longer trying to please people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this sentence are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>If I were still trying to please people, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">though I’m not,</span> I would not be Christ’s servant.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Suppose I were still trying to please people. Then I would not be a servant of Christ.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I am no longer trying to please people. If I were, I would not be the servant of Christ.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>servant of Christ:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>servant</em> can also be translated as “slave.” In the same way that a slave serves and obeys his master, Paul served and obeyed Christ.</p>",

When God revealed Jesus to him, he did not go to Jerusalem to learn the gospel from the apostles.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek, 1:15–17 is a long, complex sentence. Before you translate this complex sentence, it is important to understand its structure.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This long sentence begins with a time clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>15a</sup>But when God …<sup>15c</sup>was pleased <sup>16a</sup>to reveal his Son to me</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In the middle of this time clause (after the phrase “But when God”) are two clauses that describe God. (These two clauses are relative clauses):</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…who set me apart from my mother’s womb and who called me by his grace…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The main clauses are in 1:16c–17c:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>16c</sup>I did not rush to consult with flesh and blood <sup>17a</sup>nor did I go up to Jerusalem …<sup>17b</sup>but I went into Arabia <sup>17c</sup>and later returned to Damascus.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In many languages it will be necessary to divide this long Greek sentence into several shorter sentences. It may also be necessary to change the order of some of the clauses in this long sentence. Examples are given in the notes below.</p></div><h4>1:15</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek, 1:15 begins with the clause “But when God was pleased/decided.” This is a time clause. Many English versions put parts of this time clause later in 1:15. Some versions even put this time clause in 1:16.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The KJV shows the literal Greek order. You should compare the Greek/KJV order with the other options below. Then decide how to structure this verse and where the most natural place is in your language for the parts of this time clause. Some examples are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>15</sup>But <u>when it pleased God</u>, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called <em>me</em> by his grace, <sup>16</sup>To reveal his Son in me (KJV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>15a–b</sup>But God in his grace chose me even before I was born, and called me to serve him. <sup>15c</sup>And <u>when he decided</u> <sup>16</sup>to reveal his Son to me… (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>15a</sup>But <u>when he</u> who had set me apart before I was born, <sup>15b</sup>and who called me by his grace, <sup>15c</sup><u>was pleased</u> <sup>16a</sup>to reveal his Son to me (ESV)</p></blockquote><h4>1:15a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:15a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ But God had chosen me while I was in my mother’s womb,</p></li><li><p>¶ But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in spite of that,</span> before I was born, God had chosen me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to do his work</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But:</strong> There is a contrast here. The contrast is between what Paul formerly was (1:13–14) and what Paul became (1:15–24). Most English versions indicate this contrast with the conjunction <em>But</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to begin this verse are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Nevertheless</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But in spite of that</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But then something happened! (NLT96)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who set me apart from my mother’s womb:</strong> This clause is a relative clause. It describes something that God did.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Be careful to translate this clause in a way that does not imply that there is another God, a God who did not set Paul apart. In some languages, it will be natural to translate this clause as a complete sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God set me apart from birth.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Even before I was born, God chose me.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>set me apart:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>set me apart</em> means “appointed me” or “chose/selected me.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>appointed me (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>chose me (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be necessary to state what God had chosen Paul to do. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>chose me to do his work</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>from my mother’s womb:</strong> The BSB translates this Greek phrase literally.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>while I was in my mother’s womb</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>before I was born (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>from birth (NIV)</p></blockquote><h4>1:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and called me by His grace,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and had called me because of his kindness.</p></li><li><p>Because he is kind, he had called/made me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be his servant/child</span>.</p></li><li><p>He was good/kind to me and called me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be an apostle</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and called me by His grace:</strong> This is another relative clause. It also describes something that God did. As in 1:15a, be careful to translate this clause in a way that does not imply that there is another God, a God who did not call Paul. In some languages, it will be natural to translate this clause as a separate sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He called me through his grace (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>called:</strong> The verb <em>called</em> means “invited” or “chose someone for a special purpose.” In this case, God called Paul to be his servant/apostle.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this verb are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He called me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to serve him</span>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He invited me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be his servant/apostle</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul did not mean “call” in the sense of “shouted” or “yelled.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>by His grace:</strong> The word <em>grace</em> means “showing kindness, generosity, or favor to someone who does not deserve it.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>by/through his kindness/favor</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because of his kindness</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He was kind/good to me</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also grace, Meaning 2 in the Glossary.</p><h4>1:15c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:15c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>was pleased</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">So</span> when it pleased him</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">So then,</span> God was glad/happy</p></li><li><p>Then it was good to him</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice that some English versions are like the BSB and place “was pleased” at the end of 1:15. Other versions place this phrase at the beginning of 1:16. You should do what the major language version in your area does.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>was pleased:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>was pleased</em> basically means “took pleasure in” or “considered something to be good.” It can have the additional meaning of “was pleased with something and so decided to do it.” God wants and likes to reveal Jesus to human beings, and here he decided to do reveal Jesus to Paul.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this verb are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Then it pleased him (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when God was delighted</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when God considered it good</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when he decided (GNT)</p></blockquote>",

Examples are given in the notes below.</p></div><h4>1:16a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:16a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to reveal His Son in me</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to show his Son to me</p></li><li><p>to cause me to know his Son</p></li><li><p>to make me to understand who his Son really is.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to reveal His Son in me:</strong> This clause means that God showed Paul that Jesus was his/God’s son.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The verb <em>reveal</em> does not just mean that Paul saw Jesus with his eyes. It means that God caused Paul to understand who Jesus really was. This happened on the road to Damascus.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to show me his Son (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to cause me to know his Son</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to make me to understand who his Son really is</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His Son:</strong> The phrase <em>His Son</em> refers to God’s Son, Jesus. “The Son of God” or “God’s Son” is a title that was often used to refer to a savior who would be a descendant of King David. God would send this savior to rescue his people. This person was often referred to as the “Messiah” or “Christ.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The title “the Son of God” also indicates that Jesus has the same nature and character as God. The relationship between God the Father and Jesus, his Son, is similar in some way to the relationship between human fathers and sons. God the Father does not have a physical body. He did not have a sexual relationship with Mary that resulted in her becoming pregnant and giving birth to Jesus. The Son of God existed eternally as the Son with his Father.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In areas where people do not understand the title “the Son of God” in this way, you may want to include a footnote that explains the correct meaning. Here is a suggested footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This title refers to Jesus. It indicates that Jesus has the same nature and character as God. It does not mean that God the Father had a sexual relationship with Mary that resulted in her becoming pregnant and giving birth to Jesus. Mary became pregnant with Jesus in a miraculous way by the Holy Spirit of God.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is natural to speak of a son as a “child,” without specifying male or female. If that is true in your language, you may use a more general term, such as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his Child<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A translation of the title “the Son of God” must include a familial term such as “son” or “child.” Translations such as “the man who is God,” “the divine man,” or “the God man” are not acceptable, since they do not retain familial language. Examples of acceptable translation options include “the Son who comes from God,” and “the divine/unique/eternal Son of God.”</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Other verses will usually make clear that Jesus was a male child. If you use a phrase such as “his male child,” be sure that it does not imply that God had another child who was female.</p><h4>1:16b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:16b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that I might preach <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about</span> him to the Gentiles,</p></li><li><p>so that I might preach/announce <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the good news about</span> him to the non-Jews.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He did this</span> so that I could tell the news about his Son to people who are not Jews.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles:</strong> This clause tells God’s purpose in revealing Jesus to Paul. God showed Jesus to Paul <u>so that</u> Paul would tell the good news about him to the Gentiles.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that I would announce his message to the Gentiles (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that I might tell the Good News about him to those who are not Jewish (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that I would tell people who are not Jewish that his Son is the Good News (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Gentiles:</strong> The word <em>Gentiles</em> refers to all people who were not Jews. This is the first time that this word occurs in Galatians.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the people who are not Jews</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>non-Jews</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See Gentiles, Meaning 1 in the Glossary.</p><h4>1:16c–17</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">The main clause of 1:15–17 begins in 1:16c. This clause first states what Paul <u>did not do</u>, and then it states what he <u>did do</u> immediately after God revealed Jesus to him. This is the main clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…<sup>16c</sup>I did not immediately consult with anyone <sup>17a</sup>nor did I go up to Jerusalem …<sup>17b</sup>but I went into Arabia…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul’s main point is that he did not receive the gospel from people. Your translation should make this main point clear. In some languages, this will be clearer if you first translate what Paul did. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>17b</sup>I immediately went into Arabia <sup>16c</sup>without consulting any man <sup>17a</sup>or going up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before me. <sup>17c</sup>Later I returned to Damascus.</p></blockquote><h4>1:16c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:16c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I did not rush to consult with flesh and blood,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I did not go to anyone and ask him to teach me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the good news</span>.</p></li><li><p>When this happened, I did not ask anyone to teach me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the gospel</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I did not rush to consult with flesh and blood:</strong> This clause means that Paul “did not ask for information from someone” or “did not ask for instruction from someone.” Paul did not go to anyone to ask them to tell him or teach him or give him advice about the good news.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I did not go to anyone for advice (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I did not ask anyone to teach me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about the gospel</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When all this happened to me, I did not rush out to consult with anyone else (NLT96)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>rush:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>rush</em> relates to all three clauses in 1:16c, 1:17a, and 1:17b. In the first two clauses Paul told us what he did not do. In the third clause, he told us what he did do. In some languages, it may be more natural to place the word <em>rush</em> in the third clause (the one that tells us what Paul did do). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but <u>right away</u> I departed to Arabia (NET)</p></blockquote>",

Paul’s purpose in writing this section was to convince the Galatians that the true gospel is the one that he preached.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other possible headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s Message Comes from Christ (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jesus Alone Gave Paul the Good News He Spreads (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s Authority is from God (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God is the source of Paul’s authority and message</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1049001015\" data-endVerseId=\"1049001017\"><h3>Paragraph 1:15–17</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, Paul again wrote that he received the gospel from God and not from men. When God revealed Jesus to him, he did not go to Jerusalem to learn the gospel from the apostles.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek, 1:15–17 is a long, complex sentence. Before you translate this complex sentence, it is important to understand its structure.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This long sentence begins with a time clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>15a</sup>But when God …<sup>15c</sup>was pleased <sup>16a</sup>to reveal his Son to me</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In the middle of this time clause (after the phrase “But when God”) are two clauses that describe God. (These two clauses are relative clauses):</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…who set me apart from my mother’s womb and who called me by his grace…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The main clauses are in 1:16c–17c:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>16c</sup>I did not rush to consult with flesh and blood <sup>17a</sup>nor did I go up to Jerusalem …<sup>17b</sup>but I went into Arabia <sup>17c</sup>and later returned to Damascus.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In many languages it will be necessary to divide this long Greek sentence into several shorter sentences. It may also be necessary to change the order of some of the clauses in this long sentence. Examples are given in the notes below.</p></div><h4>1:17a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:17a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to the apostles who came before me,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Neither did I go up to Jerusalem <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to talk</span> to those who became apostles before me.</p></li><li><p>Also, I did not go to Jerusalem to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">learn from</span> those who were apostles before I <span data-bnType=\"implied\">became an apostle</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to the apostles who came before me:</strong> This clause indicates that Paul did not go and get his message from the other apostles. These apostles were in Jerusalem. They had authority as the spiritual leaders of the church. It might be expected that Paul would go to them to learn the gospel. But he did not go to them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Nor did I go up to Jerusalem to consult with those who were apostles before I was (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I did not go to Jerusalem and learn from those who were apostles before I was</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>go up to Jerusalem:</strong> The city of Jerusalem was built on a hill. So anyone going to the city had to walk <em>up</em> the hill.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is important to say whether people walk <em>up</em> or “down” when they travel. In other languages, this will be unusual or may be confusing. If it is confusing in your language, you should simply say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>go to Jerusalem (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The same Greek verb occurs in 1:18b and 2:1a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>apostles who came before me:</strong> This phrase refers to the leaders of the church in Jerusalem. These men had become apostles before Paul became an apostle. Three of them are mentioned by name in 2:9b (Cephas, John, and James, who was the brother of Jesus).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">chosen to be</span> apostles before I was <span data-bnType=\"implied\">chosen to be an apostle</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">became</span> apostles before I <span data-bnType=\"implied\">became an apostle</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The word “apostle” first occurs in 1:1a. See also apostle in the Glossary for more information.</p><h4>1:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but I went into Arabia</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Instead, I <span data-bnType=\"implied\">immediately</span> went into Arabia.</p></li><li><p>Rather, I went <span data-bnType=\"implied\">directly</span> to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the region of</span> Arabia.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but:</strong> There is a contrast here. The contrast is between what Paul did not do (in 1:16c–17a) and what he did. Languages have different ways to indicate this negative-positive type of contrast.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>One of the functions of the Greek conjunction <em>ἀλλά</em> is to signal this negative-positive type of contrast.</span></span> Some of the ways are:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>With the conjunction “but.”</p></li><li><p>With a conjunction other than “but.” This is a common way in English to show this type of contrast. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>rather</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>on the contrary</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Instead (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>With no conjunction.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I went into Arabia:</strong> This clause states what Paul did after God revealed Jesus to him. He went to <em>Arabia</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><em>Arabia</em> is the name of a region. It was far away from Jerusalem. None of the apostles were in Arabia. This showed that God worked directly in Paul’s life apart from any connection to the apostles in Jerusalem. Paul’s point is that the gospel he preached came from God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I went immediately into Arabia (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I went away to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the region of</span> Arabia</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice the word “immediately” in the NIV example above. This word actually occurs in 1:16 in Greek (the BSB translates it as “rush” there). In English it is more natural to put the word “immediately” with the action that a person does rather than the action that the person did not do.</p><h4>1:17c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:17c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and later returned to Damascus.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Afterwards,</span> I returned to Damascus.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Then after some time there,</span> I went back to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the city of</span> Damascus.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and later returned to Damascus:</strong> <em>Damascus</em> is the name of a city. It was also far from Jerusalem. It was on the road to Damascus that God first revealed Christ to Paul (Acts 9:1–19). When Paul left the region of Arabia, he went back to the city of Damascus. Paul did not say how long he stayed in Arabia before he returned to Damascus.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and later I returned to the city of Damascus (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and afterwards I went back to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the city of</span> Damascus</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and then came back to Damascus (GW)</p></blockquote>",

In other words, you should not specifically state from which event these fourteen years are counted. However, if you cannot leave it ambiguous, follow interpretation (1).

So anyone going to Jerusalem had to walk <em>up</em> or ascend the hill.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is important to say whether people go <em>up</em> or go “down” when they travel. In other languages, this will be unusual or may be confusing. If it is confusing in your language, you should simply say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I went to Jerusalem again (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The same Greek verb occurs in 1:18b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>again:</strong> The word <em>again</em> indicates that this was another visit that Paul made to Jerusalem.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this entire clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I ascended to Jerusalem again</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I went back to Jerusalem once again</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I returned to Jerusalem</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>accompanied by Barnabas:</strong> The word <em>Barnabas</em> is the name of a man.

He showed him that he should go to Jerusalem. The apostles in Jerusalem did not send for Paul. Paul wrote this to show that he was under God’s authority, not under the authority of the apostles.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I went there because God revealed to me that I should go.

But <u>I spoke privately to those recognized as leaders</u> (BSB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and set before them (<u>though privately before those who seemed influential</u>) the gospel that I proclaim among the Gentiles (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:2b, the BSB follows the Greek order more closely than the ESV. Many languages will probably want to follow the BSB order here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and set before them:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>set before</em> also means “declared,” “communicated,” “explained,” or “made clear.” When Paul arrived in Jerusalem, he explained to the church leaders what he was teaching to the Gentiles. He wanted to get their response. He did this so that everyone would know that he and the church leaders were in agreement about the message that he preached.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this verb are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I explained (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>shared with them (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I told their leaders (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>them:</strong> The pronoun <em>them</em> refers to the leaders in the Jerusalem church. This is the first time in this passage that Paul referred to these men. In 2:9, he named them: James, Peter, and John. Elsewhere in this passage he referred to them as “the ones who seemed influential” (2:2, 2:6a, 2:6d) and “those who seemed to be pillars” (2:9).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In many languages, you must first introduce people using a noun, not a pronoun. If your language is like that, you will need to:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use a noun phrase here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the church leaders in Jerusalem</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Change the order of the clause so that the clause “those recognized as leaders” comes before the pronoun <em>them</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I had a meeting alone with those <span data-bnType=\"implied\">men</span> who were influential. I explained to them the message that I preach to the non-Jews</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles:</strong> The word <em>Gentiles:</em> is the same word that Paul used in 1:16b. See also Gentiles, Meaning 1, in the Glossary for more information.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But I spoke privately:</strong> The word <em>privately</em> indicates that Paul explained his message only to certain people. It implies that the meeting did not include the entire church.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I explained this <u>only</u> to those who were leaders</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I did this <u>alone</u> with the church leaders</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to those recognized as leaders:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>to those recognized as leaders</em> refers to the men who were recognized as important leaders of the church in Jerusalem. These leaders included Peter, James, and John. (See Galatians 2:9 and Acts 15:6.)</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the influential people (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those esteemed as leaders (NIV11)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the leaders of the church (NLT96)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the leaders (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">A few English versions (such as the ESV and NIV) translate this phrase as “those who <u>seemed</u> to be leaders.” Such a translation can give the false impression that these men only “seemed” to be leaders, but they were really not leaders. Most commentaries agree that this phrase refers to recognized leaders.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example, Bruce says that the Greek word often translated as “seemed” here “carries no insinuation of sarcasm or irony, as though they only seemed to be leaders but were not really so” (p. 109).</span></span> In your translation, do not imply that Paul was questioning whether these men were actually leaders of the church.</p><h4>2:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for fear that</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I gave this report</span> so that I could be sure</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I did that</span> because I did not want</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I did that</span> so that</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for fear that:</strong> The Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>for fear that</em> introduce Paul’s purpose in explaining his message to the church leaders. Paul explained his message to the leaders (2:2b) <u>in order to</u> be sure that they agreed with his work (2:2c).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in order that</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that I could be sure/certain</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I wanted to make sure that we were in agreement (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In Greek, these words are more literally “so that not.” So another way to translate these words are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that I might not be running, or have run the race, in vain (HCSB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul did not want his work to be for nothing. If the church leaders and Paul did not agree about the content of the gospel, then the spread of the gospel would be hindered. He did not want division between the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers.</p><h4>2:2d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I was running or had already run in vain.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they agreed with me and that</span> I was not running or had run my race in vain.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the work that I am doing and the work that I have done</span> to be <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> a race that I had run for nothing.</p></li><li><p>the work that I had done, and the work that I was doing, were not worthless.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I was running or had already run in vain:</strong> This clause is a metaphor. In this metaphor, Paul compared his work of preaching the gospel to a person running a race. A preacher and a runner are similar in that both people work hard, and neither wants his work to be in vain. A person who runs a race works hard to win. Paul worked hard to preach the gospel. He wanted the gospel that he preached to have lasting effects, and he wanted the leaders to agree that it was the true gospel.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this metaphor are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the metaphor. In most languages, it will be good to add some explanation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">all my work was not in vain and</span> I was running the race for nothing.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the metaphor as a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">all the work that I had done was not like</span> a race that I had run or was running in vain</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the metaphor.

They accepted his message in spite of some opposition from false brothers.</p></div><h4>2:3</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:3, Paul gave some evidence that he had not run in vain. He gave some evidence that the leaders in Jerusalem approved the gospel that he preached. Paul did not state this explicitly, but he showed that they agreed by telling the Galatians that the leaders did not force Titus to be circumcised.</p><h4>2:3a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:3a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Yet not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I was not running in vain.</span> Titus, who was <span data-bnType=\"implied\">there</span> with me, was not even forced/required to be circumcised,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">And they agreed with me.</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">This was clear because</span> no one even insisted/demanded that my companion Titus should be circumcised.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Yet:</strong> There is a contrast between 2:2 and 2:3. The contrast is between what Paul feared might happen and what actually happened. He was concerned that the leaders would not agree with him. He was concerned that he had “run in vain” (2:2). But the leaders did agree with him and his message. Paul did not directly state that they agreed. He showed that they agreed with him by telling about Titus.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions, such the BSB and NIV, indicate this contrast with the conjunction <em>Yet</em>. Other English versions, such the ESV and NASB, indicate this contrast with the conjunction “but.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it might be necessary to make some of this information explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But I was not running in vain.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And they did agree (NLT96)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised:</strong> The words <em>not even</em> focus attention on the proof that the church leaders agreed with Paul’s message. The proof was that they did not even require a Gentile to be circumcised. If the church leaders had not agreed with Paul, they would have required that Titus be circumcised. He was right there when they made the decision. But they did not require him to be circumcised. This proved that they agreed with Paul that God accepted Gentile Christians even if they were not circumcised.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to translate this clause is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They did not even demand that my companion Titus be circumcised (NLT96)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Titus, who was with me:</strong> The clause <em>who was with me</em> is a relative clause. It describes Titus. In some languages, using this type of relative clause here would imply that there was another Titus, a Titus who was not with Paul. Even though there were certainly other men with that name, that is not the point here. In those languages, it would be better to translate these words without using a relative clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Titus was with me (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>my companion Titus (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>was compelled:</strong> The phrase <em>was compelled</em> is passive.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this phrase are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a passive clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he was not forced (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>no one forced (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they did not require/demand</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they did not insist</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>circumcised:</strong> The word <em>circumcised</em> means “cut off the loose skin at the end of a boy’s penis.” Jews circumcised their sons as an act of obedience to the law.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some cultures, it may be acceptable to use an explicit expression that means “cut off the loose skin at the end of a boy’s penis.” In other cultures, it may be necessary to use a euphemism to describe this event. Some examples are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>cut off some of the skin</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>receive the mark</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>ritual cutting</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a mark of cutting</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This is the first time that Paul mentioned circumcision in Galatians.</p><h4>2:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>even though he was a Greek.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>even though he was a Greek.</p></li><li><p>Titus was a Greek <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and had never been circumcised</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>even though he was a Greek:</strong> The fact that Titus was a <em>Greek</em> implies that he was not a Jew. So he had never been circumcised. (Most of the first Christians were Jews and had already been circumcised.) Nevertheless, the church leaders did not require Titus to be circumcised in order to be accepted as a believer.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be clearer to put this clause earlier in the verse.

This showed the Galatians that these teachers were wrong.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other possible headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul Was Accepted as an Apostle by the Leaders in Jerusalem (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The apostles accept Paul</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s apostleship and message</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Jerusalem leaders recognized Paul’s apostleship and message</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1049002001\" data-endVerseId=\"1049002005\"><h3>Paragraph 2:1–5</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, Paul told about the meeting that he and Barnabas had with church leaders in Jerusalem. In this meeting, Paul wanted to see whether the leaders would accept the message that he was teaching to Gentiles. The fact that the leaders did not require Titus, a Greek, to be circumcised showed that they accepted Paul’s message. They accepted his message in spite of some opposition from false brothers.</p></div><h4>2:4a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:4a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>This issue arose because some false brothers had come in under false pretenses</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This issue/matter arose</span> because some false brothers had secretly come</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We talked about circumcision</span> because some men who said that they were believers (but they were not) secretly came into the group.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">But some people wanted Titus circumcised. They were</span> some men who pretended to be believers. They sneaked/came into our meeting.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>This issue arose:</strong> This phrase is not in the Greek. Most commentators agree that in 2:4–5, Paul was responding to the pressure to have Titus circumcised. In 2:4, Paul began a sentence that he never finished. To make it a complete sentence, the BSB has added some words at the beginning of this verse. Some other English versions do the same. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This matter arose (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We talked about this problem (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Even that question came up only (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>although some wanted it done (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>issue</strong> The word <em>issue</em> in the BSB refers to the issue of circumcision. In some languages, it may be necessary to make this more explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We talked about the issue of circumcision</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But some people wanted him to get circumcised.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because some false brothers:</strong> The term <em>false brothers</em> refers to Jews who pretended to be Christian brothers. In fact, they were not Christian brothers. Their message was also a false message.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this term are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>false/fake Christian brothers</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who pretended to be followers (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>some men who pretended to be our brothers in Christ</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>had come in under false pretenses:</strong> In the Greek, the words that the BSB translates as <em>had come in under false pretenses</em> is actually two separate phrases. The Greek literally says “the false brothers brought in secretly, came in by stealth.” There are two ways to interpret the Greek word literally translated as “brought in secretly”:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It has an <u>active</u> sense and describes what <u>the false brothers themselves did</u>. They brought themselves secretly into the meeting. According to this interpretation, this word and the Greek word that is literally “came in by stealth” refer to the same action. Most English versions that follow this interpretation translate both Greek words as one English verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>had sneaked in among us (CEV) <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, NET, NJB, REB, NLT96, CEV, JBP)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It has a <u>passive</u> sense and describes what <u>other people did for the false brothers</u>. Other people brought the false brothers into the meeting secretly. According to this interpretation, this word refers to a different action than the Greek word literally translated as “came in by stealth.” Most English versions that follow this interpretation translate the two Greek words with two different English expressions. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>False Christians were brought in. They slipped in (GW) <em>(ESV, RSV, KJV, NASB, GW, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). The phrase <em>had come in under false pretenses</em> suggests that the false brothers came into the meeting of their own initiative.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">You should use a verb that describes the actions of spies/traitors who “sneak” into groups and their meetings.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this entire expression are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>these men slipped into our group (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>some false brothers had infiltrated our ranks (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>some false brothers had secretly joined/attended our meeting</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>some false believers had come into our group secretly.

In this context, the false brothers certainly came to watch with evil intentions. They wanted to destroy the freedom of the new Christians. In some languages, it may be good to make this more explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to spy on us and take away (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as spies. They had come to take away (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to observe us and destroy/remove</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>our freedom in Christ Jesus:</strong> This clause refers to the freedom that believers have, because they believe in Christ Jesus, from obeying the law of Moses. As believers in Christ, the Galatians were not obligated to be circumcised as the Jews who were under the law were. They were free from those types of religious laws.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the freedom that Christ Jesus had given us (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We are free <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from the law because we believe</span> in Christ Jesus</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ Jesus:</strong> In 1:1c, 1:3, and 1:12c, the order of this phrase is “Jesus Christ.” This is the first time the order is <em>Christ Jesus</em>. In most English translations and other national language translations, “Jesus Christ” and “Christ Jesus” are translated in the same order as they occur in the Greek.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Remember that <em>Christ</em> is a title, and <em>Jesus</em> is a name. Some languages will always put a title before a name. So, in some languages, it may be natural always to use the same order.</p><h4>2:4c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:4c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in order to enslave us.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They did this</span> to make us<sup>(incl)</sup> slaves.</p></li><li><p>in order to make us slaves <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to the law of Moses</span>.</p></li><li><p>They wanted to enslave us and force us to follow their Jewish regulations.

Paul is saying:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>4b</sup>The false brothers wanted to take our liberty away from us <sup>4c</sup><u>in order that</u> they could make us slaves.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it will be natural to begin a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They wanted to make us like slaves.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>enslave us:</strong> This clause means that the false brothers wanted to make the Galatian believers slaves to the law of Moses. The false brothers wanted Gentile Christians to follow all the rules of the Jewish law. They especially wanted them to be circumcised. If Gentile Christians did what the false brothers wanted, they would become like slaves who are required to obey a master.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to make us slaves <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to the law</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They wanted to enslave us and force us to follow their Jewish regulations.

Paul did not want the good news of salvation by faith to be changed. He did not want the church to require Gentile believers to be circumcised.

The fact that some people were with Jesus while he was on the earth was not important. Notice that Paul said “whatever they <u>were</u>.” He did not say “whatever they <u>are</u>.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The leaders of the church in Jerusalem were important men, and Paul thought that it was important to meet with them.

A literal translation of this Greek idiom would be something like “God does not accept/receive the face of a man.” This idiom means that God does not judge a person based on outward things such as wealth or status.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul used this idiom to say that, in God’s eyes, the church leaders were not more important than he was.

He did this by telling them about the meeting that he had in Jerusalem with the apostles there. At this meeting, the apostles recognized Paul’s authority as an apostle. They also agreed that he preached the true gospel.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This meeting became necessary because of the message of some false teachers. These false teachers insisted that a person was not truly saved unless he also became circumcised and kept the laws of Moses. (See Acts 15:1–2 and Galatians 2:4.) At the meeting, the apostles agreed with Paul. They agreed that no one should force non-Jewish believers to be circumcised and obey the Law that God gave to Moses. This showed the Galatians that these teachers were wrong.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other possible headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul Was Accepted as an Apostle by the Leaders in Jerusalem (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The apostles accept Paul</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s apostleship and message</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Jerusalem leaders recognized Paul’s apostleship and message</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1049002006\" data-endVerseId=\"1049002010\"><h3>Paragraph 2:6–10</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, Paul wrote about two results from the meeting in Jerusalem.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The first result of that meeting (2:6) was that the apostles and elders did not find it necessary to add circumcision or anything else to Paul’s message. They agreed that the gospel that Paul preached was true and complete.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The second result (2:7–9) was that the apostles agreed that Paul had full authority as an apostle.

The BSB has not translated this conjunction, and many other versions, including the ESV, NIV, NET, and NLT, also do not translate it. In some languages, it will not be necessary to translate this conjunction either. Connect 2:7a to 2:6b in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>On the contrary:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>On the contrary</em> introduces the unexpected way that the leaders responded to what Paul told them. The leaders may have been expected to teach Paul some things and add to his message. But instead of doing that, they agreed with his message.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to introduce the leaders’ unexpected response are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Instead (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But instead <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of adding something to my message</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But rather <span data-bnType=\"implied\">than adding something to my message</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they saw that:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB literally translates as <em>saw</em> means “realized,” “understood,” or “accepted.” The leaders recognized that the gospel that Paul preached was true and complete.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this verb are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They realized that (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they recognised that (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they understood that</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Do not use a word that implies that the leaders literally saw something.</p><h4>2:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I had been entrusted to preach the gospel to the uncircumcised,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I had been given the work of telling the gospel to people who are not circumcised,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> had given me the message about Jesus Christ to preach to people who are not Jews,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> had given me the work of telling the good news to the Gentiles. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">He gave me that work</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I had been entrusted to preach the gospel to the uncircumcised:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>entrusted</em> means “given the work/responsibility of.” This word is related to the word for “trust” or “have faith in.” God had given Paul the task of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles. He trusted Paul to be faithful in doing the task.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a passive clause. Some ways to translate this clause are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a passive verb.

They were people who were not circumcised.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If your word for circumcised is a long phrase, you may want to translate the phrase <em>the uncircumcised</em> in another way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who are not Jewish (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Gentiles (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>2:7c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:7c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>just as Peter had been to the circumcised.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>just as Peter had been given the work of telling the gospel to people who are circumcised.</p></li><li><p>as <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he</span> had given Peter the message about Jesus for the Jews.</p></li><li><p>as <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he</span> had given Peter the work of telling that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">same</span> good news to the Jews.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>just as Peter had been to the circumcised:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>just as</em> links Paul’s ministry with Peter’s ministry. It means that God had entrusted Paul with the gospel <u>in the same way</u> that he had entrusted Peter with the gospel. They both preached the same gospel, but they preached it to different groups of people. Peter preached to the circumcised.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here Paul used the word <em>circumcised</em> to refer to Jews.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a passive clause.

They recognized that God had given him authority to preach the gospel to the Gentiles.</p></div><h4>2:8a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:8, Paul continued to compare himself to Peter. Believers at that time recognized that God was working through Peter. Peter did miracles, and his preaching resulted in people believing in Jesus. Paul also did miracles, and people also came to believe in Jesus through Paul’s ministry. Through his ministry, people also received the Holy Spirit. So Paul’s ministry was equal to Peter’s ministry. This evidence supports Paul’s statement in 2:7 that God had entrusted him with the gospel.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Because Paul compared himself to Peter, it may be more natural in some languages to put Paul first (as in 2:7b–c). In other words, it may be more natural to change the order of 2:8a and 2:8b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>b</sup>God is working through my ministry to the Gentiles <sup>a</sup>just as he is working through Peter’s ministry to the Jews.</p></blockquote><h4>2:8a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:8a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For the One who was at work in Peter’s apostleship to the circumcised</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>God worked through Peter to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">make successful</span> his ministry/work as an apostle to the people who are circumcised.</p></li><li><p>Just as God helped Peter to do well his work as an apostle among the Jews,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> Verse 2:8 supports and further explains Paul’s statement in 2:7b–c. There he stated that God had given him the work of spreading the gospel. God had given him this work just as he had given this work to Peter. Here, Paul explained and supported this statement by saying that God worked through his ministry just as he worked through Peter’s ministry.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek introduces this explanation with a conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>For</em>. Some English versions do not translate this conjunction. In some languages, it will not be necessary to translate this conjunction either.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the One who was at work in Peter’s apostleship:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the clause that the BSB translates as <em>the One who was at work in Peter’s apostleship</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means that God worked in/through Peter in his ministry as an apostle. This means that <u>God made his ministry as an apostle effective/successful</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God helped Peter work with the Jews (NLV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God who had done such great work in Peter’s ministry for the Jews (JBP) <em>(BSB, NIV, ESV, RSV, NLT, JBP, KJV, NASB, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means that God worked in Peter’s life and made him an apostle. <u>God called/made Peter to be an apostle</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The one who made Peter an apostle to Jewish people (GW) <em>(GNT, GW, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). The majority of English versions follow this interpretation. And this interpretation is a stronger argument. Paul’s point is that his ministry was equal with Peter’s. His ministry had the same results as Peter’s ministry.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God worked through Peter to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">make</span> his work as an apostle <span data-bnType=\"implied\">successful</span>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God caused Peter to do <span data-bnType=\"implied\">well</span> his work as an apostle.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God blessed Peter’s work as an apostle.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the One who:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>the One who</em> refers to God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God, who was at work in Peter as an apostle (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>apostleship:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>apostleship</em> refers to the ministry/work that an apostle does.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the ministry…as an apostle (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the work of an apostle</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to the circumcised:</strong> The word <em>circumcised</em> refers to “Jews.” You should translate this word as you did in 2:7c.</p><h4>2:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>was also at work in my apostleship to the Gentiles.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">In the same way</span>, he also worked through me to make <span data-bnType=\"implied\">successful</span> my ministry to the Gentiles.</p></li><li><p>he also helped me to do my work well as an apostle among the non-Jews.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>was also at work in my apostleship to the Gentiles:</strong> This entire clause means that God also worked through Paul and made his ministry as an apostle successful. As a result, Paul, like Peter, did miracles. And many people also became Christians because of his ministry.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He also worked through me to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">make</span> my work as an apostle <span data-bnType=\"implied\">successful</span>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God also caused me to do <span data-bnType=\"implied\">well</span> my work as an apostle.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He also blessed me and my work as an apostle.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Gentiles:</strong> The word that the BSB translates as <em>Gentiles</em> refers to people who are not Jews.

It compares the leaders of the church to pillars.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">A “pillar” is a huge stone post or wood column that supports the roof of a building. Paul compared the church leaders to pillars. They are similar in that both have a very important role in their respective structures. Pillars are a very important part of the building. The three men had much responsibility in the church.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some possible ways to translate this metaphor are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Change the metaphor to a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those men who were recognized as important/strong <u>like</u> pillars</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use another idiomatic expression for leaders.

See what word(s) you used in 2:2b and 2:6a. As mentioned there, this term refers to the men who were “recognized” as important leaders of the church.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who had a reputation (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those esteemed (NIV11)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who were known (NLT96)</p></blockquote><h4>2:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>shook hands with Barnabas and me to show that we were all fellow workers.</p></li><li><p>They shook hands with Barnabas and me as a sign that they agreed with us.</p></li><li><p>They told Barnabas and me that they were partners with us <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the work</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship:</strong> This clause means that James, Peter, and John shook the hands of Paul and Barnabas. Shaking hands was a cultural action that showed that these three men agreed that they were partners together with Paul in ministry. It showed that the leaders agreed with Paul and Barnabas, accepted them, and supported them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they shook hands with Barnabas and me, agreeing to be our partners (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they shook hands with Barnabas and me to show that we were companions in God’s work</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some cultures, shaking hands may not show that people agree with one another.

He did this by telling them about the meeting that he had in Jerusalem with the apostles there. At this meeting, the apostles recognized Paul’s authority as an apostle. They also agreed that he preached the true gospel.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This meeting became necessary because of the message of some false teachers. These false teachers insisted that a person was not truly saved unless he also became circumcised and kept the laws of Moses. (See Acts 15:1–2 and Galatians 2:4.) At the meeting, the apostles agreed with Paul. They agreed that no one should force non-Jewish believers to be circumcised and obey the Law that God gave to Moses.

(Acts 11:25–30 also talks about their time in Antioch.) During that period, Peter came to visit. While he was there, a group of Jewish Christians from Jerusalem also arrived. They did not accept uncircumcised non-Jewish believers as true Christians. While these people were in Antioch, Peter, Barnabas, and some of the other Jewish Christians decided to stop having fellowship with the uncircumcised non-Jewish believers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Peter’s actions did not follow the truth of the gospel.

(As was mentioned in 2:9b, Cephas is Peter’s Jewish name.) In your translation, avoid implying that Paul rebuked Peter as soon as he arrived in Antioch.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>During the time when Peter was in Antioch</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>One time Peter came/went to Antioch. While he was there</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Antioch:</strong> <em>Antioch</em> was an important city in the region of Syria. It was far from Jerusalem. Paul and Barnabas were members of the church in Antioch. See also Acts 13:1–3.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>however:</strong> This verse is the beginning of a new section. In Greek, this verse begins with a conjunction that English versions sometimes translate as “but” and which the BSB translates as <em>however</em>. The BSB has put the word after the mention of Peter coming to Antioch, but in Greek it comes at the start of the sentence. The English words “but” and <em>however</em> indicate a contrast. It is true that there is some contrast between this section and the previous section. In the previous section, Peter agreed that circumcision was not necessary for salvation. In this section, he separates himself from uncircumcised believers. So his actions were not consistent with his words.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, the contrast is not completely obvious. It is perhaps better to consider the Greek conjunction as functioning to introduce a new development in Paul’s letter. In such a case, this word does not need to be translated in many languages. Many English versions (such as the NIV) do not translate this word here.</p><h4>2:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I opposed him to his face,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I rebuked him face-to-face,</p></li><li><p>I reprimanded/scolded him in front of the other believers,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I opposed him:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>opposed</em> refers to confronting, correcting, and rebuking.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this verb are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I rebuked him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I scolded/reprimanded him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I told him…that he was wrong.

But this situation was so serious that Paul decided to rebuke Peter in front of other believers (2:14).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>face to face (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>openly (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in front of the other believers</p></blockquote><h4>2:11c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:11c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because he stood to be condemned.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because what he had done was wrong.</p></li><li><p>because he had done something that was not right/good.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because:</strong> The word <em>because</em> introduces the reason why Paul rebuked Peter. Paul rebuked Peter (2:11b) <u>because</u> he was wrong (2:11c).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is more natural to put the reason clause in 2:11c before 2:11b.

It is possible that the men from James told Peter about these men.</p></li><li><p>the men from James themselves</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">In your translation, you should not specify which group it was.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He was afraid of those who insisted that circumcision was necessary. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he was afraid of those who were in favor of circumcising them (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He was afraid of criticism from these people who insisted on the necessity of circumcision. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Peter was perhaps afraid that this group would not approve of him eating with Gentile believers. He was perhaps afraid of what they would think or say about him. He was not afraid that they would physically harm him. If this party was (b) above, he may have even feared that his actions could cause Jewish militants to persecute Jewish believers.</p>",

(Acts 11:25–30 also talks about their time in Antioch.) During that period, Peter came to visit. While he was there, a group of Jewish Christians from Jerusalem also arrived. They did not accept uncircumcised non-Jewish believers as true Christians. While these people were in Antioch, Peter, Barnabas, and some of the other Jewish Christians decided to stop having fellowship with the uncircumcised non-Jewish believers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Peter’s actions did not follow the truth of the gospel.

Here, it indicates that Peter and the other Jews in Antioch knew that eating with Gentiles was a good thing. But in front of the Jews from Jerusalem, they pretended that they believed that it was not good. They acted in a way that they did not believe was correct. They did that because they wanted to please other people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this verb are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>acted/behaved in a way that was not right</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they began doing things that they knew were not correct</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>joined him:</strong> This phrase indicates that the other Jewish believers followed Peter’s example.

Peter and the other Jewish believers stopped eating with the Gentiles, and <u>as a result</u>, Barnabas also stopped eating with them. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>with the result that (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions, such as the NCV, do not translate this conjunction. In some languages, it may not be necessary to translate this conjunction either.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>hypocrisy</em> is a noun form of the verb “acted hypocritically,” which Paul used in 2:13a. (The BSB translates the verb there with the noun “hypocrisy”). It refers to the actions of Peter and the other Jews: they started to do what they knew was wrong. Their wrong actions caused even Barnabas to do what was wrong.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is passive. Some ways to translate it are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a passive clause.

Because they had worked closely together, he did not expect Barnabas to do such a thing. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Barnabas himself</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>was led astray:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>led astray</em> is used in a figurative sense. It has the meaning of being led down the wrong moral path. Barnabas was led away from the truth of the gospel to follow the example of Peter and the other Jewish believers. He, too, stopped eating with the Gentile believers. He should have known better, but he yielded to the pressure of the others.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this verb are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>was carried/pulled/dragged along</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>was influenced (NCV)</p></blockquote>",

This meant that they had to reject the idea that they were justified by obeying the law. Paul emphasized that justification is by faith in Christ alone. Peter’s actions had implied that it was also necessary to keep the law. That would make Christ’s death meaningless and nullify the grace of God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:14c, Paul began to speak directly to Peter. There are at least three ways to interpret where Paul’s direct speech to Peter ends:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>It ends after verse <u>21</u>. <em>(NIV, NASB, CEV)</em></p></li><li><p>It ends after verse <u>14</u>. In verses 15–21, what Paul said to Peter is indirect speech. <em>(BSB, ESV, NET, RSV, JBP, GNT, NJB, GW, NCV)</em></p></li><li><p>It ends after verse <u>16</u>. <em>(NLT)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">It is recommended that you follow option (1). In 2:15, it is possible that Paul began to also talk to the other people who were there. But he was still also talking to Peter. So Paul’s speech does not end until verse 21.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Schreiner on page 150 says, “The first question to be asked is where Paul’s words to Peter, which began in 2:11, end. Since quotation marks are lacking in the original manuscripts, certainty eludes us. Possibly the words directed to Peter conclude after 2:14, 2:15, 2:16, 2:18, or 2:21. I personally argue that it makes most sense to see all of 2:14–21 as addressed to Peter. At least four pieces of evidence support this conclusion. (1) Verse 15 is not clearly set off from 2:11–14. (2) The first person plural pronouns in 2:15–17 most naturally refer to Jewish Christians and would speak to such people in Antioch. (3) Verse 17 may reflect the charges against Peter. (4) A new subject commences on 3:1, where the Galatians are addressed directly.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">If you choose option (2), your translation should still show that Paul is indirectly speaking to Peter in 2:15–21. For example, at the beginning of 2:15, the JBP says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And then I went on to explain that (JBP)</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:14a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:14a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>When I saw that they were not walking in line with the truth of the gospel,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ But when I saw that they were not acting according to the true gospel,</p></li><li><p>¶ But when I saw that those people were not following the true message of the gospel,</p></li><li><p>¶ But when I discovered that they were not obeying the true gospel,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse begins with a Greek conjunction that is often translated as “but.” Most English versions translate it that way in order to show that there is a contrast between 2:11–13 and 2:14–21. The contrast is between Peter’s wrong way to think and act and the right way. Here is another way to show this contrast:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>However</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The BSB has not translated this conjunction, and some other versions, such as the NIV and NLT, also do not translate it. In some languages, it will not be necessary to translate this conjunction either. Connect 2:14a to 2:13b in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>When I saw:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>I saw</em> includes the meaning of “discovered” or “found out.” Paul discovered that Peter was acting hypocritically and rebuked him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When I discovered</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When I noticed/observed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that they were not walking in line with:</strong> In Greek, this verb phrase is more literally “they were not walking straight to.” It means that “they did not act/live rightly.” When Peter, Barnabas, and other Jewish believers at Antioch separated themselves from the Gentile believers, they were not living according to the truth of the gospel.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they were not walking a straight path in line with (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that they were not following (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that they were not really obeying (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>they were not walking:</strong> This phrase refers to the actions of Peter, Barnabas, and the other Jewish believers who had separated themselves from the Gentile believers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the truth of the gospel:</strong> This phrase means “the message of the true gospel” or “the truth that is the gospel.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the true gospel</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the true Good News</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the true message from God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul used this same phrase in 2:5b.</p><h4>2:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I said to Cephas in front of them all,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I said to Peter in front of everyone,</p></li><li><p>I <span data-bnType=\"implied\">rebuked</span> Peter publicly. I said to him,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I said to Cephas in front of them all:</strong> This clause introduces Paul’s words of rebuke to Cephas (Peter). One way to make it clear that Paul was rebuking Peter is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I <u>rebuked</u> Peter in front of everyone <u>and said</u></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in front of them all:</strong> This phrase indicates that Paul rebuked Peter where everyone in the Antioch church would also hear what he said.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>publicly</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that everyone could hear (JBP)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Peter’s actions had affected the whole church in Antioch. It was a serious problem. Paul had to rebuke Peter publicly.</p><h4>2:14c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:14c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“If you, who are a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“Even though you<sup>(sing)</sup> are a Jew, you behave/live like a Gentile and not like a Jew.</p></li><li><p>“You<sup>(sing)</sup> are a Jew, but you live/act like a Gentile. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">You do</span> not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">live/act</span> like a Jew.</p></li><li><p>“Peter, you are a Jew, but you live like a Gentile. (CEV)</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>If you, who are a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew:</strong> In this “if” clause, there is an embedded phrase <em>who are a Jew</em>. In some languages, it will be easier to put this embedded phrase first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You are a Jew. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">But</span> if you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The clause <em>If you…live like a Gentile</em> was true. Peter was living like a Gentile in the sense that he was eating with Gentiles. He was not separating himself from Gentiles during meals like Jews were supposed to do. He was probably eating food that was not acceptable to Jews.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it will be easier to translate this clause without using “if.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Even though you are a Jew, you are behaving like a Gentile and not like a Jew.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Peter,</span> you are a Jew, but you live/act like a person who is not a Jew. You do not live/act like a Jew.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that the phrase <em>a Jew</em> is repeated. In some languages, it is not necessary to repeat it. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Peter, you are a Jew, but you live like a Gentile. (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>2:14d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:14d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>how can you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">So</span> why do you<sup>(sing)</sup> force the Gentiles to live like Jews?</p></li><li><p>You<sup>(sing)</sup> must not force non-Jewish <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believers</span> to follow Jewish customs.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>how can you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. It is a rebuke. When Peter stopped eating with the Gentile Christians, his actions implied (falsely) that believers needed to follow Jewish laws. In that way, he was forcing the Gentiles to obey those laws and thus to live like Jews. So Paul rebuked him for his behavior.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this rebuke are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>How can you require Gentile <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believers</span> to live like Jews?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So why do you now try to force those who are not Jewish to live like Jews?

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You must not force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs!</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this rebuke in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>compel:</strong> The word <em>compel</em> means “require.” It is the same word that Paul used in 2:3a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>force</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>push</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Gentiles:</strong> In this clause the word <em>Gentiles</em> refers to non-Jewish Christians.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to live like Jews:</strong> The Greek word which the BSB translates as <em>live like Jews</em> refers to becoming Jewish.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to become Jews</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to follow Jewish customs (NIV)</p></blockquote>",

It is salvation by faith in Christ alone. Obeying the law is not part of the true gospel. Doing what the law demands does not justify anyone.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul told how Peter had deserted the true gospel. He wanted the Galatians to understand how they too were deserting the true gospel. They had started to think that it was necessary to obey the law to be justified. Paul wanted them to read about his rebuke to Peter so that they could recognize how their own situation was similar. They must completely reject justification through the law. He emphasized that justification is by faith in Christ alone.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section also shows that Paul’s authority as an apostle was at least as great as Peter’s was. This section is also an indirect rebuke of the false teachers who had come to the Galatian churches and required the non-Jews to adopt Jewish traditions to be accepted as true Christians.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other possible headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul rebukes Peter</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul defended the truth of the gospel</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul shows how Peter was wrong</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1049002014\" data-endVerseId=\"1049002021\"><h3>Paragraph 2:14–21</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, Paul asked Peter and the other Jewish believers to live according to the true gospel. This meant that they had to reject the idea that they were justified by obeying the law. Paul emphasized that justification is by faith in Christ alone. Peter’s actions had implied that it was also necessary to keep the law. That would make Christ’s death meaningless and nullify the grace of God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:14c, Paul began to speak directly to Peter. There are at least three ways to interpret where Paul’s direct speech to Peter ends:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>It ends after verse <u>21</u>. <em>(NIV, NASB, CEV)</em></p></li><li><p>It ends after verse <u>14</u>. In verses 15–21, what Paul said to Peter is indirect speech. <em>(BSB, ESV, NET, RSV, JBP, GNT, NJB, GW, NCV)</em></p></li><li><p>It ends after verse <u>16</u>. <em>(NLT)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">It is recommended that you follow option (1). In 2:15, it is possible that Paul began to also talk to the other people who were there. But he was still also talking to Peter. So Paul’s speech does not end until verse 21.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Schreiner on page 150 says, “The first question to be asked is where Paul’s words to Peter, which began in 2:11, end. Since quotation marks are lacking in the original manuscripts, certainty eludes us. Possibly the words directed to Peter conclude after 2:14, 2:15, 2:16, 2:18, or 2:21. I personally argue that it makes most sense to see all of 2:14–21 as addressed to Peter. At least four pieces of evidence support this conclusion. (1) Verse 15 is not clearly set off from 2:11–14. (2) The first person plural pronouns in 2:15–17 most naturally refer to Jewish Christians and would speak to such people in Antioch. (3) Verse 17 may reflect the charges against Peter. (4) A new subject commences on 3:1, where the Galatians are addressed directly.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">If you choose option (2), your translation should still show that Paul is indirectly speaking to Peter in 2:15–21. For example, at the beginning of 2:15, the JBP says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And then I went on to explain that (JBP)</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:16</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse contains many clauses. Some of the clauses at the end of the verse repeat information from the beginning. In some languages, it may be more natural to avoid repeating the information. One way to do this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>a</sup>know that a man is not justified by works of the law, <sup>b</sup>but by faith in Jesus Christ. <sup>c</sup>So we, too, have believed in Christ Jesus. <sup>d</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We did this</span> that we may be justified.</p></blockquote><h4>2:16a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:16a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>know that a man is not justified by works of the law,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>However, we<sup>(incl)</sup> know that a person is not justified by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">means of</span> obeying the law,</p></li><li><p>In spite of that, we know that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> does not consider a person as blameless because of his obeying the law <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Moses</span>.</p></li><li><p>However, we know that following the law does not make anyone right with God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:16, Paul said something that people would not normally expect a Jew to say. The unexpected statement was that he and Peter (who were born Jews and had lived by the law) knew that a person was not justified by obeying the law. Paul introduced this unexpected statement with a Greek conjunction that is often translated as “but.” Some other ways to translate this conjunction are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>however</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>yet (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>nevertheless (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in spite of that</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The BSB has not translated this conjunction, and some other versions, such as the NIV, also do not translate it. In some languages, it will not be necessary to translate this conjunction either. Connect 2:16a to 2:15 in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>know that a man is not justified:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>justified</em> means that God has made us acceptable to him. It means “acquitted,” “pronounced and treated as righteous,” or “accepted as righteous before God.” A person who is <em>justified</em> is found to be in perfect conformity to God’s law. He no longer has his sins counted against him. God forgives him and considers him to be a righteous person.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the word <em>justified</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>accepted as righteous by God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>considered straight before God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>made right with God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a person’s sins are taken care of</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also justify in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is passive. Some ways to translate it are:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use a passive clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we know that a person is justified not by the works of the law (NRSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a clause that is not passive. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we know that a person is made right with God not by following the law (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we know that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> does not considers a person as blameless because he follows the law</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by works of the law:</strong> The phrase <em>by works of the law</em> refers to obeying the law of Moses. It indicates that a person is not justified <u>by means of</u> obeying/following the law.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>through keeping the law</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if/when he obeys the law</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because of his following the law</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>by following the law</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the law:</strong> The word <em>law</em> refers to “the law of Moses” or “the law that God gave through Moses.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Note that some translations such as GNT capitalize the letter “l” in law. This is to show that the word <em>law</em> here refers specifically to the “law of Moses” and not to just a church or government law. Although it may help a few educated readers to see a capital letter, you should not rely on capital letters to indicate significant meaning differences. The question to ask is, “Can the word be understood with the correct meaning if it is not capitalized?”</span></span> Since there are many individual laws within the law of Moses, some languages may have to use the plural form “laws.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the law <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Moses</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the laws <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God gave through Moses</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jewish</span> law</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the laws <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God gave</span></p></blockquote><h4>2:16b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:16b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but by faith in Jesus Christ.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but <span data-bnType=\"implied\">only</span> by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">means of</span> believing in Jesus Christ.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God considers him blameless</span> because of his trust in Jesus Christ.</p></li><li><p>The only way <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be made right with God</span> is to believe/trust in Jesus Christ.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but:</strong> There is a contrast between 2:16a and 2:16b. The contrast is between the way that we are not justified (2:16a) and the way that we are justified (2:16b). The BSB indicates this contrast with the conjunction <em>but</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to indicate this contrast are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but only</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Instead,</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some words from the previous clause are implied but not repeated here. In some languages, it may be more natural to repeat some of those words from the previous clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that he is justified</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Instead, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we know that</span> the only way <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be justified</span> is</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by:</strong> The preposition <em>by</em> introduces the way that a person is justified. Justification is <u>by means of</u> faith in Jesus Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this preposition are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>through</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if/when</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because of</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>faith in Jesus Christ:</strong> The term <em>faith</em>, when applied to <em>Jesus Christ</em>, refers to “belief” or “trust” in Jesus Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>believing/trusting in Jesus Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>belief/trust in Jesus Christ</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See faith, Meaning 1 in the Glossary.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:16a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be natural to change the order of 2:16a and 2:16b and put the way to be justified first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>16a</sup>We know that a man <sup>16b</sup>is only justified by faith in Jesus Christ. <sup>16a</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He is</span> not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">justified</span> by observing the law.</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:16c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:16c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So we, too, have believed in Christ Jesus,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>So, we<sup>(incl)</sup> too have believed in Christ Jesus,</p></li><li><p>That is why we<sup>(incl)</sup> also, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like the non-Jews,</span> have trusted in Christ Jesus,</p></li><li><p>Therefore, we <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jews</span>, we<sup>(incl)</sup> also have trusted in Jesus Christ,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So:</strong> Verse 2:16c is the main clause in 2:16. It is the result of 2:16a–b. Some versions are like the BSB and add the conjunction <em>So</em> to show how the clauses are connected.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to begin this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>That is why</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>For that reason</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we, too, have believed in Christ Jesus:</strong> The pronoun <em>we</em> refers to Peter, Paul, and all Christian Jews. The word <em>too</em> implies that these Jews had done like the Gentiles: they also had trusted in Christ Jesus for their salvation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jews</span> have also trusted in Christ Jesus</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See faith, Meaning 1 in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ Jesus:</strong> Here in Greek, the word <em>Christ</em> comes before <em>Jesus</em>. In 2:16b, the order is “Jesus Christ.” The order of these two words makes no difference in the meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be possible to follow the Greek order. In other languages, it will be necessary to change the order. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>b</sup>but only by believing in Jesus Christ. <sup>c</sup>So we also believed in <u>Jesus Christ</u> (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>2:16d–e</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:16d–e, Paul repeated what he said in 2:16a–b. He said that the way we are justified is by faith. It is not by obeying the law. He repeated it because it is very important.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">See the example above under 2:16 for a way to avoid the repetition.</p><h4>2:16d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:16d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that we may be justified by faith in Christ</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>in order that we may be justified by believing in Christ,</p></li><li><p>so that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> might consider us as blameless because of our trusting in Christ.</p></li><li><p>because the only way to be made right <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with God</span> is to trust in Christ.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that we may:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>that</em> introduces the purpose of believing in Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to connect this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in order that</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>be justified:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>be justified</em> is the same word as in 2:16a. Translate it in the same way.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This verb is a passive verb. Some ways to translate this verb are:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use a passive clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that we may be made right <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with God</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> might justify us</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by faith in Christ:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>by faith in Christ</em> means by/through “believing” or “trusting” in Jesus Christ. It is the same phrase that is used in 2:16b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>by means of trusting/believing in Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if/when we believe in Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because of our belief/trust in Christ</p></blockquote><h4>2:16e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:16e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and not by works of the law,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and not by obeying the law,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God does</span> not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">consider us blameless</span> because of our obeying the law.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We are</span> not made right <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with God</span> if/when we follow the law.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and not by works of the law:</strong> This phrase is the same phrase that is used in 2:16a.

They believed in Christ <u>because</u> they knew it was impossible to be justified by obeying the law.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to introduce the reason is to begin a new sentence here:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We trusted in Christ</span> because</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by works of the law no one will be justified:</strong> This was the third time Paul made this point. This was important because the Galatians had added obeying the law to faith. Paul wanted them to understand clearly that it is impossible to be justified by works of the law.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>no one will be justified by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">means of</span> following the law</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">we know that God</span> will not justify anyone because of his obeying the law</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>will be justified:</strong> This is the same word as in 2:16a and 2:16d. You should translate it in the same way.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In 2:16a, Paul used the present tense when he said that “man is not justified by works of the law.” Here he used the same verb in the future tense. Some ways to translate this verb in the future tense are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will be considered as blameless in the sight of God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will be accepted as righteous by God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will be considered straight with God’s law</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will be made right with God</p></blockquote><h4>2:16a–f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:16a–f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(reordered) However, we know that a person is made right with God by believing in Jesus Christ and not by obeying the law.

So Paul’s speech does not end until verse 21.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Schreiner on page 150 says, “The first question to be asked is where Paul’s words to Peter, which began in 2:11, end. Since quotation marks are lacking in the original manuscripts, certainty eludes us. Possibly the words directed to Peter conclude after 2:14, 2:15, 2:16, 2:18, or 2:21. I personally argue that it makes most sense to see all of 2:14–21 as addressed to Peter. At least four pieces of evidence support this conclusion. (1) Verse 15 is not clearly set off from 2:11–14. (2) The first person plural pronouns in 2:15–17 most naturally refer to Jewish Christians and would speak to such people in Antioch. (3) Verse 17 may reflect the charges against Peter. (4) A new subject commences on 3:1, where the Galatians are addressed directly.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">If you choose option (2), your translation should still show that Paul is indirectly speaking to Peter in 2:15–21. For example, at the beginning of 2:15, the JBP says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And then I went on to explain that (JBP)</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:17a–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But if, while we seek to be justified in Christ, we ourselves are found to be sinners, does that make Christ a minister of sin? Certainly not!:</strong> In Greek, 2:17 is a complex sentence. Before you translate this complex sentence, it is important to understand its grammatical structure.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The main part of this verse is the rhetorical question at the end of the verse: <em>does that make Christ a minister of sin?</em> This rhetorical question begins with an <em>if</em> clause. In the middle of this <em>if</em> clause, there is an embedded clause: <em>while we seek to be justified in Christ</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Your translation may be easier to understand if you put this embedded clause first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We are endeavoring/seeking to be justified in Christ. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">But</span> if, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">while doing that,</span> we too are found to be sinners, is Christ then a servant of sin? Certainly not!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The parts of this verse are explained below.</p><h4>2:17a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:17a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But if, while we seek to be justified in Christ,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But if, while we are seeking to be made right <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with God</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by believing</span> in Christ,</p></li><li><p>While we are looking/trying to have <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> make us right/straight <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with him</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because of our faith</span> in Christ,</p></li><li><p>We want <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> to make us right <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with him</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by our faith</span> in Christ.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But:</strong> There is a contrast between the clause “not Gentile ‘sinners’” (in 2:15) and “if…we ourselves are found to be sinners” (here in 2:17). The BSB indicates this contrast with the conjunction <em>But</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This contrast is between two clauses that are separated by several verses. So some English versions do not indicate this contrast with a conjunction. In some languages, no conjunction will be necessary here either.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>while we seek to be justified in Christ:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>while we seek</em> means “we are seeking/looking.” It implies success.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The clause <em>to be justified in Christ</em> has the same meaning as “we may be justified by faith in Christ” (2:16d). It means that God makes us right with him because we believe in Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we seek to be made right with God through faith in Christ (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we try to be put right with God by our union with Christ (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we want <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> to consider us righteous because of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">our faith in</span> Christ</p></blockquote><h4>2:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>we ourselves are found to be sinners,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>we also are found/discovered to be sinners,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">they</span> regard/count us also to be sinners,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">While doing that,</span> we have become sinners like <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the Gentiles</span> in the eyes of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">some Jews</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we ourselves are found to be sinners:</strong> The pronoun <em>we</em> refers to Paul, Peter, Barnabas, and other Jews who became Christians.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are several ways to interpret this clause. Two of the main interpretations are centered on the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>are found</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It has a <u>passive</u> meaning. Peter, Paul, and other Jewish Christians were found to be sinners <u>by other Jews</u> who still followed the law. One example of this was when the men from James arrived in Antioch and found Peter and other Jews eating with Gentiles. They found that they were not obeying the law. The men from James found/considered Peter and other Jewish Christians to be sinners just as the Gentiles were sinners.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This interpretation is sometimes called the post-conversion view. According to Moo, “Neither interpretation is without its problems” (p. 164), but the post-conversion view has fewer problems. Of this interpretation, Schreiner says, “In the first view, the charge leveled against Paul and other Jewish Christians is unfounded. They were accused of being sinners since they had abandoned the Torah, but Paul was not a sinner, since he had died and been raised with Christ” (p. 167).</span></span></p></li><li><p>It has a <u>reflexive</u> meaning. Peter, Paul, and other Jewish Christians found <u>themselves</u> to be sinners. This happen when they were searching to be right before God and they realized that the law would not save them. They realized that they themselves were sinners just like the Gentiles.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This interpretation is sometimes called the pre-conversion view. Of this interpretation, Schreiner says, “The second view…argues that the charges are in fact true. Paul accepts in the ‘if’ clause the reality of the charge. In other words, Peter and Paul had been found to be sinners in seeking to be justified in Christ, and they recognized that they were no better than Gentiles” (pp. 167–168).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we discovered that we are sinners too (CEV)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions are ambiguous, and it is not possible to tell which interpretation they follow. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This interpretation suits the context of 2:16 and also the previous paragraph about the men from James.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">According to interpretation (1), some Jews accused Peter and Paul of being sinners because they had abandoned the law of Moses. But their accusation was not true. Peter and Paul were not sinners in God’s eyes. Paul did not agree with their accusation, but he included it to show that its conclusion was not logical.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this clause are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a passive clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we ourselves have also been found to be sinners (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>hey found/regarded us also to be sinners</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">some Jews</span> considered us also to be sinners</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>found:</strong> Here, the word <em>found</em> means “considered” or “regarded.” Jews who followed the law “regarded” Jewish Christians as sinners. This word does not mean “found” in the sense of lost and then found.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>considered/regarded</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>counted</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>looked upon</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sinners:</strong> Here the word <em>sinners</em> refers to someone who does not follow all the Jewish laws. One example is Peter. The men from James found Peter to be a sinner because he ate with Gentiles. He also probably ate their food. These things were against Jewish laws. The Jews considered Peter and the other Jewish believers to be sinners, but they were not sinners in God’s eyes.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">To make this meaning clear, it may be necessary to add some information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sinners <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the eyes of some Jews</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>found <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by some Jews</span> to be sinners</p></blockquote><h4>2:17c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:17c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>does that make Christ a minister of sin? Certainly not!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>then does Christ encourage us to sin? Never!</p></li><li><p>then does Christ lead us to sin? No, never!</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">If that were true,</span> that would mean that Christ made us sinners. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">But</span> it is not true!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>does that make Christ a minister of sin?:</strong> The phrase <em>a minister of sin</em> refers to someone who “serves sin” or “works for sin.” A person who works for sin is someone who encourages other people to sin.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is a rhetorical question. Paul used this rhetorical question to emphasize that Christ does not serve sin. He does not encourage people to sin.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this rhetorical question are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>does that mean that Christ encourages us to sin? (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Would that mean Christ has led us into sin? (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Does this mean that Christ is the one who makes us sinners? (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This does not in any way mean that Christ encourages us to sin.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use whichever form is most natural in your language to emphasize that Christ does not serve sin.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Certainly not!:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>Certainly not</em> is a strong response, “No!” to the rhetorical question.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Never!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Absolutely not!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>No, no, no!</p></blockquote>",

It is salvation by faith in Christ alone. Obeying the law is not part of the true gospel. Doing what the law demands does not justify anyone.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul told how Peter had deserted the true gospel. He wanted the Galatians to understand how they too were deserting the true gospel. They had started to think that it was necessary to obey the law to be justified. Paul wanted them to read about his rebuke to Peter so that they could recognize how their own situation was similar. They must completely reject justification through the law.

This meant that they had to reject the idea that they were justified by obeying the law. Paul emphasized that justification is by faith in Christ alone. Peter’s actions had implied that it was also necessary to keep the law. That would make Christ’s death meaningless and nullify the grace of God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:14c, Paul began to speak directly to Peter. There are at least three ways to interpret where Paul’s direct speech to Peter ends:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>It ends after verse <u>21</u>. <em>(NIV, NASB, CEV)</em></p></li><li><p>It ends after verse <u>14</u>.

In 2:15, it is possible that Paul began to also talk to the other people who were there. But he was still also talking to Peter.

A sinner is not someone who abandons the law and believes in Jesus to make him righteous. A sinner is someone who returns to following the law after abandoning it. Paul introduces this explanation with a Greek conjunction is often translated as “for,” as in many English versions. Some other ways to introduce this explanation are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What I mean is that</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Rather (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The BSB has not translated this conjunction, and some other versions, such as the NIV and GNT, also do not translate it. In some languages, it will not be necessary to translate this conjunction either. Connect 2:18a to 2:17c in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>If I rebuild what I have already torn down:</strong> This “if” clause contains a metaphor. In this metaphor, Paul compared <u>justification by following the law</u> to a building. He compared <u>abandoning the law as a means of justification</u> to <u>tearing down</u> the building. And he compared <u>returning to obeying the law as a means of justification</u> to <u>rebuilding</u> the building.

In some languages, it will be more natural to change the order of the terms <em>rebuild</em> and <em>torn down</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if I tear down something and then build it again (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I return to obeying the law for justification, it is as if</span> I rebuild a building that I had destroyed.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning.

These were the people who implied that obeying the law was necessary for justification. Paul used the pronoun <em>I</em> here to be polite and indirect.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages can use the pronoun <em>I</em> in this way. In English and many other languages, the pronoun <em>I</em> is confusing here. Some languages use other means to be polite and indirect. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>If <u>a person</u> rebuilds what <u>he</u> destroyed</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>If <u>we</u> rebuild what <u>we</u> destroyed</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>If <u>someone</u> destroys something then rebuilds it again</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In this verse, use whichever form is most natural in your language.

In this clause, Paul stated that people who return to obeying the law for justification show that they are lawbreakers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul was probably still thinking of what Peter did. Peter broke Jewish laws when he ate with Gentiles. (He tore down the building.) Then he started to follow the law again when he stopped eating with them. (He rebuilt the building.) When he returned to following the law, he showed that he had broken the law. He showed that he was a lawbreaker. So Christ was not the one who led him to sin. Peter’s own actions showed that he had become a sinner.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>then I show myself to be someone who breaks the Law (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>then he shows that he did not follow/obey the law</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we show that we are sinners</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I:</strong> You should use the same pronoun or word as you used in 2:18a.</p>",

He related his personal experiences to make his point.</p><h4>2:19a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:19a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For through the law I died to the law</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the requirements</span> of the law, I died to the law,</p></li><li><p>I am <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> a dead person, and the law no longer has power over me. The law itself required that I die.</p></li><li><p>The law’s power over me has ended because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ died to pay the penalty</span> of the law <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and because I died with him</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> In this verse, Paul further explained his statement in 2:18. This statement was that a person sins when he rebuilds the law. A person does not sin when he abandons the law. Paul has a new relationship with the law.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek introduces this explanation with a conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>For</em>. Another way to translate this conjunction is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>For you see that</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions do not translate this conjunction. In some languages, it will not be necessary to translate this conjunction either.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>through the law:</strong> There are at least two ways to interpret the phrase that the BSB translates as <em>through the law</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to <u>Christ paying</u> for the requirements of the law. The law requires death for those who do not keep the entire law. Christ fulfilled those requirements by dying in Paul’s (and our) place to pay the penalty for the failure to keep the law. Paul was crucified with Christ (2:20a), and he died with him. So because of the requirements of the law, Paul considered himself dead (with Christ), and, therefore, dead to the law. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It was the Law itself that killed me (CEV) <em>(GNT, CEV, NCV)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Of this interpretation, Fung says, “This death is accomplished ‘through the law’; this is more specifically expressed in the clause “I have been crucified with Christ,” which refers not in an ethical sense to a subjective experience in Christian consciousness, but to the believer’s objective position in Christ. By virtue of his incorporation into Christ (cf. v. 17) and participation in Christ’s death Paul has undergone a death whereby his relation to the law has been decisively severed and the law has ceased to have any claim on him (cf. Rom. 7:4, 6). But since the vicarious death of Christ for sinners was exacted by the law (cf. Gal. 3:13) and was ‘first an affirmation of [the law’s] verdict,’ Paul’s death to the law through participation in Christ’s death can be said to be ‘through the law.’ This death ‘through the law…to the law’ means not only that the law as a false way of righteousness has been set aside but also that the believer is set free from the dominion of the law (under which there is transgression, Rom. 4:15) for a life of consecration to God (cf. Rom. 7:6)” (p. 123).</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to <u>Paul realizing</u> that he could not keep the requirements of the law. Paul tried to keep the law, but eventually he realized that he failed. In other words, it was through/in trying to keep the law that he realized that the law could not justify him. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when I tried to keep the law, I realized I could never earn God’s approval (NLT96) <em>(NLT96, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Many English versions translate this phrase literally, and it is not possible to tell which interpretation they follow. If possible, you should also translate this phrase in a way that both interpretations can be understood. The end result of both interpretations is the same: Paul died to the law. If you must make a choice, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This interpretation fits well with the context of 2:20a, “I have been crucified with Christ.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the requirements</span> of the law</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ died to pay the penalty</span> of the law <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and because I died with him</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the law caused me (to die to it)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I died to the law:</strong> This clause is a metaphor. In this metaphor, Paul compared being released/freed from obeying the law to dying to the law. They are similar in that the law no longer had any control over Paul when he became a believer. Paul did not have to obey the law to be right with God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul used similar metaphors in phrases such as dying to sin, the world, and self. In each case, he meant that these things no longer had control/power over him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this metaphor are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the metaphor and also explain the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I “died”, and now I am dead to the Law’s demands (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I died and now the law no longer has control of me.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Change the metaphor to a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it is as if I died to the law</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I became like a dead person regarding the law</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was released/freed from obeying the law</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the law’s power over me came to an end</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">In your translation, do not imply that Paul died physically or that the law actually killed him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I:</strong> Paul used an emphatic pronoun in this verse. He wrote about his personal experience of justification by faith apart from the law. He used his personal experience to reinforce that justification is by faith and not by works of the law.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to show this emphasis are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Me, I</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>As for me</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:19a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it might be more natural to change the order of the two clauses in 2:19a (and begin a new sentence at 2:19b). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I died to the law because of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the requirements of</span> the law.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> a dead person, and the law no longer has power over me. The law itself required that I die.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am no longer under the law. It was the law itself that did this to me.</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:19b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:19b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that I might live to God.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>in order that I might live for God.</p></li><li><p>Now I live for God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and do what he wants</span>.</p></li><li><p>As a result, I live to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">serve</span> God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that I might live to God:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>so that</em> indicates that this clause gives the purpose for dying to the law. Paul died to the law <u>so that</u> he might live for God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Living to/for God means to live a life under the control of God. Paul meant that because he believed in Christ, he was justified and had a new relationship with God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that I might live for God (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in order to live to serve God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that I can now live to follow God</p></blockquote>",

It is salvation by faith in Christ alone. Obeying the law is not part of the true gospel. Doing what the law demands does not justify anyone.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul told how Peter had deserted the true gospel. He wanted the Galatians to understand how they too were deserting the true gospel. They had started to think that it was necessary to obey the law to be justified. Paul wanted them to read about his rebuke to Peter so that they could recognize how their own situation was similar. They must completely reject justification through the law. He emphasized that justification is by faith in Christ alone.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section also shows that Paul’s authority as an apostle was at least as great as Peter’s was. This section is also an indirect rebuke of the false teachers who had come to the Galatian churches and required the non-Jews to adopt Jewish traditions to be accepted as true Christians.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other possible headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul rebukes Peter</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul defended the truth of the gospel</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul shows how Peter was wrong</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1049002014\" data-endVerseId=\"1049002021\"><h3>Paragraph 2:14–21</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, Paul asked Peter and the other Jewish believers to live according to the true gospel. This meant that they had to reject the idea that they were justified by obeying the law. Paul emphasized that justification is by faith in Christ alone. Peter’s actions had implied that it was also necessary to keep the law. That would make Christ’s death meaningless and nullify the grace of God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:14c, Paul began to speak directly to Peter. There are at least three ways to interpret where Paul’s direct speech to Peter ends:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>It ends after verse <u>21</u>. <em>(NIV, NASB, CEV)</em></p></li><li><p>It ends after verse <u>14</u>. In verses 15–21, what Paul said to Peter is indirect speech. <em>(BSB, ESV, NET, RSV, JBP, GNT, NJB, GW, NCV)</em></p></li><li><p>It ends after verse <u>16</u>. <em>(NLT)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">It is recommended that you follow option (1). In 2:15, it is possible that Paul began to also talk to the other people who were there. But he was still also talking to Peter. So Paul’s speech does not end until verse 21.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Schreiner on page 150 says, “The first question to be asked is where Paul’s words to Peter, which began in 2:11, end. Since quotation marks are lacking in the original manuscripts, certainty eludes us. Possibly the words directed to Peter conclude after 2:14, 2:15, 2:16, 2:18, or 2:21. I personally argue that it makes most sense to see all of 2:14–21 as addressed to Peter. At least four pieces of evidence support this conclusion. (1) Verse 15 is not clearly set off from 2:11–14. (2) The first person plural pronouns in 2:15–17 most naturally refer to Jewish Christians and would speak to such people in Antioch. (3) Verse 17 may reflect the charges against Peter. (4) A new subject commences on 3:1, where the Galatians are addressed directly.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">If you choose option (2), your translation should still show that Paul is indirectly speaking to Peter in 2:15–21. For example, at the beginning of 2:15, the JBP says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And then I went on to explain that (JBP)</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:20a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:20a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I have been crucified with Christ,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>With Christ, I have been crucified</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It’s like</span> I <span data-bnType=\"implied\">too</span> have died on the cross with Christ.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It’s as if</span> I was nailed on the tree and died together with Christ.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Some English versions (such as the CEV, GNT, and NJB) put the clause “I have been crucified with Christ” at the end of 2:19 rather than at the beginning of 2:20. You should follow the example of the national version when you decide in what verse to place these words.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I have been crucified with Christ:</strong> This clause is a metaphor. In this metaphor, Paul compared freedom from his previous life under the law to Christ’s death. They are similar in that both experienced the end of the law.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul did not physically die on a cross with Christ. He did not die at the same time as Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this metaphor are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the metaphor. This is what most English versions do. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have been nailed to the cross with Christ. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was put to death on the cross with Christ (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My old self has been crucified with Christ.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is as if I have died with Christ on the cross</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Do not try to make explicit who crucified Paul.</p><h4>2:20b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:20b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and it is no longer I who live but it is Christ who lives in me.</p></li><li><p>I myself am no longer alive. Rather it is Christ who is alive in me.</p></li><li><p>It’s as if I am not alive, but Christ is alive in me.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and I no longer live:</strong> This clause continues the metaphor. In this metaphor, Paul compared freedom from his previous life under the law to no longer being alive. Obviously, Paul was still living when he wrote this, but his old self was no longer living. The person who was under the law was no longer alive.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In Greek, the pronoun <em>I</em> is emphasized.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and as for me, I live no longer</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it’s as if I myself am no longer alive</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it’s as if I am not alive</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I have died (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but Christ lives in me:</strong> In this clause, Paul clearly stated that the source of his life is Christ.

This title indicates that Jesus has the same nature and character as God. It also indicates that the relationship between God the Father and Jesus, his Son, is similar in some way to the relationship between human fathers and sons. God the Father does not have a physical body. He did not have a sexual relationship that resulted in Mary becoming pregnant and giving birth to Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus Christ,</span> God’s Son</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Son of God, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus Christ</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Jesus is referred to as “His Son” (God’s Son) in 1:16.

The Greek introduces this explanation with a conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>For</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to begin this explanation are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I do not reject the grace of God</span> , <u>because</u></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I do not do this</span> , <u>because</u></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it will not be necessary to translate this conjunction. In other languages, it will be more natural to change the order of 2:21b–c and 2:21a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>b</sup>If righteousness were through the law, <sup>c</sup>then Christ died for no purpose. <sup>a</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">But righteousness is not through the law. It is through grace.</span> So I do not reject the grace of God.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if righteousness comes through the law:</strong> This clause means “if a person could become righteous through/by obeying the law of Moses.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>if</em> introduces a statement that is not true. Paul used this “if” sentence to show the consequences of Peter’s action. Peter’s actions implied that a person could become right with God by means of obeying the law.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this sentence are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if a person could become righteous by obeying the law</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if obeying the law could make a person right with God— <span data-bnType=\"implied\">but it cannot</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>suppose righteousness could be gained/found through the law</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>righteousness:</strong> The word <em>righteousness</em> refers to the character trait of being “upright,” “blameless” or “just.” A person can never be made right with God by obeying the law.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>right with God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>acceptable to God (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>uprightness/blamelessness in the sight of God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See righteous in the Glossary for more information.</p><h4>2:21c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:21c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Christ died for nothing.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>then Christ&apos;s death had no purpose.”</p></li><li><p>then that would make Christ’s death worthless.”</p></li><li><p>it was useless for Christ to die.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Christ died for nothing:</strong> In this context, the phrase <em>for nothing</em> means “for no purpose.” This clause states the consequence that would result if 2:21b were true.

They had forgotten that they had been made right with God (justified) and had received the Holy Spirit by believing. They should not then begin to do/obey the law to be made right with God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Being made right with God (justification) has always been an issue of believing. Abraham himself was justified because he believed. People who are Abraham’s children are those who believe. They are the ones who are blessed. People who try to be made right with God by obeying the law are cursed, because no one can obey the entire law.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul wanted the Galatians to change their ways. He was convinced that if they thought about their actions and understood the truth, they would change.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other examples for a heading for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Justification by Law or by Faith?

(It is perhaps the strongest rebuke in the whole New Testament.) Paul rebuked the Galatians using several rhetorical questions. He used these rhetorical questions to tell the Galatians that he was very unhappy with them. He was unhappy because they had turned away from believing/trusting in Christ.</p></div><h4>3:1</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek, 3:1a–c is one sentence. This whole sentence is a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified? (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Most English versions are like the BSB and divide 3:1a–c into several sentences. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified. (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to change the order of the clauses in this verse. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1a</sup>You foolish Galatians! <sup>1c</sup>Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified. <sup>1b</sup>Who has bewitched you?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1b</sup>Who has bewitched you, <sup>1a</sup>you foolish Galatians? <sup>1c</sup>Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified.</p></blockquote><h4>3:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>O foolish Galatians!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Are you Galatians mad/crazy?</p></li><li><p>¶ You Galatians are so foolish!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>O foolish Galatians:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>O</em> has several functions. One of its functions is to introduce a rebuke. Paul used this word to introduce his rebuke of the Galatians believers because they began to follow the law.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Many English versions do not translate this word. Instead, they use an exclamation point to show that Paul began to rebuke the Galatians. They also supply the pronoun “you.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You foolish Galatians! (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Many English versions do not show that 3:1a–c is a rhetorical question until 3:1b. However, it is also possible to translate 3:1a as a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Are you Galatians foolish/mad?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>foolish:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>foolish</em> refers to someone who can think, but who fails to do so. It is the opposite of the word “wise.” Paul used this word to show the Galatians that they were not thinking clearly. They had allowed themselves to be misled. They had accepted false teaching without properly thinking about the consequences.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>fools</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>crazy/mad</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>stupid (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>lost your heads/minds</p></blockquote><h4>3:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Who has bewitched you?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Why did you allow people to put a spell/curse on you?</p></li><li><p>You permitted someone to deceive you. Why did you do that?</p></li><li><p>You should not have allowed people to deceive/blind you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Who has bewitched you?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. Paul used this rhetorical question to rebuke the Galatians for their wrong thinking. Their thinking was so wrong that it was as if they were bewitched. (See an explanation of the word <em>bewitched</em> below.)</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this rebuke are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Who put a spell on you? (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What magician has cast an evil spell on you? (NLT96)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Why did you allow people to deceive/trick you?</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement followed by a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You permitted someone to bewitch you. Why did you do that?</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As an exclamation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You should not have allowed someone to trick you!</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use whichever form is most natural in your language to rebuke someone for wrong thinking.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>bewitched:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>bewitched</em> refers to putting a magical spell or curse on someone. The Galatians were turning away from the true gospel. It was as if someone had put a magical spell or curse on them. This word can also refer to someone who is “misled” or “deceived.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>put a spell/curse on</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>deceived</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>blinded</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Galatians did not literally have a curse or spell put on them. If the people who read your translation understand the word <em>bewitched</em> only in its literal meaning, you should not use it. Instead, look for a way to translate the idea of being misled or deceived.</p><h4>3:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The crucifixion of Jesus Christ was explained as clearly <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as if it happened</span> before your eyes.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span> openly explained to you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">how</span> Jesus Christ died on a cross. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">It was as if you had seen it</span> with your own eyes.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span> clearly taught <span data-bnType=\"implied\">how and why</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they</span> nailed Jesus Christ on a cross. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">It that not true?</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">It was as clear as if you had seen it</span> with your own eyes.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Before your very eyes:</strong> This phrase refers to the time when Paul personally preached to the Galatians. His message about Christ’s death was so clear that it was as if they had actually seen Christ on the cross before/with their own eyes.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">it was as if you had seen it</span> with your eyes</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Jesus Christ’s death was made as clear to you as if you had seen a picture (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>clearly portrayed</em> can refer to a public poster. On this poster, information was written or even painted so that everybody could go and look at it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul used this phrase in a metaphorical way to refer to his preaching. He explained Christ’s crucifixion in detail. It was as if the Galatians had been there and could see it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is passive. Some ways to translate it are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a passive clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You…were told very clearly about the death of Jesus Christ on the cross. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jesus Christ’s death was made as clear to you as if you had seen a picture of his death on the cross (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I told you exactly how Jesus Christ was nailed to a cross. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I clearly explained to you how Jesus Christ died on a cross.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Not only did the Galatians understand how Christ was crucified, they had understood the purpose of Christ’s death. Christ’s death was the means of their being made right with God. It may be necessary to make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I clearly explained <u>how</u> Jesus Christ was crucified, and <u>the reason why</u> he was crucified.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>as crucified:</strong> This phrase refers to Christ being nailed on a cross and dying.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase is also passive. Some ways to translate it are:</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:1c</strong></h5><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use a passive. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>was nailed to a cross (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>was killed on a cross</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>how they nailed Jesus Christ on a cross</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>how they killed Jesus Christ</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek, 3:1c is a part of the rebuke and rhetorical question that begins in 3:1a. The BSB translates 3:1c as a statement. But in some languages, it may be natural to translate 3:1c as a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Wasn’t Christ Jesus’ crucifixion clearly described to you? (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I clearly explained to you how they nailed Jesus Christ to a cross, did I not? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">It was as if you had seen it</span> with your own eyes.</p></blockquote></div>",

(It is perhaps the strongest rebuke in the whole New Testament.) Paul rebuked the Galatians using several rhetorical questions. He used these rhetorical questions to tell the Galatians that he was very unhappy with them. He was unhappy because they had turned away from believing/trusting in Christ.</p></div><h4>3:3</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Before you translate 3:3a–c, there are three issues to consider:</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><u>Issue 1: The number of sentences</u></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In Greek, 3:3a–c is one sentence. This whole sentence is a rhetorical question. In some languages, it may be possible to translate this Greek sentence as one sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>a</sup>Are you foolish enough to think that <sup>b</sup>after you began by the Spirit, <sup>c</sup>you can finish by the flesh?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">All English versions translate 3:3a as a separate rhetorical question. These versions then translate 3:3b–c as one or two additional sentences. (Examples are given in the Notes on 3:3a–c below.) In many languages, it will probably be natural to also translate 3:3a–c as two or three sentences.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><u>Issue 2: The contrasting parallels</u></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that there are two parallels in this verse. These parallels contrast. The first contrasting parallels are “starting” and “finishing.” They are underlined below:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>After <u>starting</u> in the Spirit, are you now <u>finishing</u> in the flesh?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The second contrasting parallels are “with the Spirit” and “with the flesh.” They are underlined below.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>After starting <u>in the Spirit</u>, are you now finishing <u>in the flesh</u>?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It is good to recognize these contrasting parallels even if you cannot translate them literally in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><u>Issue 3: The order of the clauses</u></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural to change the order of these clauses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>3b</sup>After starting with the Spirit, <sup>3a</sup>it’s foolish <sup>3c</sup>to attempt to finish by human effort.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>3b</sup>You began your life in Christ by the Spirit. <sup>3c</sup>Now are you trying to make it complete by your own power? <sup>3a</sup>That is foolish.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Why are you so foolish?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Are you mad/crazy?</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a tag question.

Paul reminded the Galatians that their lives in Christ began when they received the Holy Spirit.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this clause are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As the first part of the sentence that continues in 3:3c. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>After beginning with the Spirit (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>After starting your Christian lives in the Spirit (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a separate sentence.

In this part of the rhetorical question of 3:3b–c, Paul emphasized that the Galatians had begun their Christian lives with the Holy Spirit.

The idea of <em>finishing</em> here contrasts with the idea of “starting” in 3:3b. According to this interpretation, Paul asked the Galatians, “Are you now going to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">change from the way you began your Christian life and</span> use your own efforts to continue until the end?” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>are you now trying to finish by human effort? (NET) <em>(BSB, NIV11, NET, RSV, GNT, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>to perfect</u> and refers to the Galatians adding something to their spiritual lives to become perfect. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>why are you now trying to become perfect by your own human effort? (NLT) <em>(ESV, NLT, NASB, REB, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). The thought here is similar to Philippians 1:6, which says, “He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.” (BSB)</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><u>Issue 2: The rhetorical question</u></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul again used a rhetorical question to rebuke the Galatians. He wanted them to realize that it made no sense to begin by/with the Spirit and then change to their own strength. They were foolish to try to live their Christian life <em>in the flesh</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this rebuke are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>do you now want to finish by your own power?

In other word, it refers to the <u>persecution</u> that they had suffered. In this interpretation, the verb is understood in a negative sense. It is likely that the Galatian believers had previously suffered for their faith because of persecution. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Have you suffered so many things for nothing? (NET) <em>(BSB, NIV, ESV, NET, GW, KJV, NASB, NLT96, JBP)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to the <u>good and bad</u> things that they had experienced.

(RSV) <em>(NIV11, RSV, GNT, NLT04, NCV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to the <u>good</u> experiences they have had since they believed in Christ.

Salvation never depended on keeping the law.</p></div><h4>3:6a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So also, “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness”:</strong> This verse is a quotation from Genesis 15:6. It proves that God considered Abraham as righteous by means of faith. Abraham’s righteousness did not depend on anything that he did.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">You may want to make it clear that this is a quotation from Genesis. One way to do this is to put the reference in a footnote at the end of the verse (as in the BSB). A sample footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This is a quotation from Genesis 15:6.</p></blockquote><h4>3:6a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:6a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So also, “Abraham believed God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Think about Abraham. “He trusted God,</p></li><li><p>¶ Remember Abraham <span data-bnType=\"implied\">our</span><sup>(excl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">father/ancestor</span>. “He put his faith/trust in God</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So also:</strong> There are at least three ways to interpret the function of the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>So also</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It <u>introduces an example</u>.

The longer introduction would be “just as it is written” (as in Romans 1:17). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Scriptures say that God accepted Abraham because Abraham had faith. (CEV) <em>(ESV, CEV, NCV, GNT<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>GNT says, “Consider the experience of Abraham; as the scripture says…” So the GNT follows both interpretation 1 and interpretation 2.</span></span>)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It <u>introduces a comparison</u>. The comparison is between Abraham in 3:6 and “those who believe” in 3:7. They were both God’s people because they believed. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6</sup>Just as Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness, <sup>7</sup>so then, understand that those who believe are the sons of Abraham.

He stated that Gentiles would be included in the people who are the true sons of Abraham. Paul introduces this added information with a Greek conjunction that is often translated as “and.” Some English versions, such as the ESV and NET, translate it that way. Here are some other ways to introduce this added information:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Furthermore</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In addition</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What’s more (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The BSB has not translated this conjunction, and some other versions, such as the NIV and GNT, also do not translate it. In some languages, it will not be necessary to translate this conjunction either. Connect 3:8a to 3:7b in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The Scripture:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>The Scripture</em> is more literally “the writing.” It refers to the words that God directed someone to write.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In this verse, the Scripture “foresaw” (3:8a) and “foretold” (3:8c) things to Abraham. There was no Scripture when Abraham was alive. (It was centuries later when Moses wrote about these things.) So in this verse, it is best to understand <em>The Scripture</em> to mean “In the Scripture, God.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It is written in the Bible that God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In God’s book, it says that he</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s written word says that he</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The God of Scripture</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>foresaw that:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>foresaw</em> means “seeing something before it happens” or “seeing into the future.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>saw ahead of time that (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>looked forward to this time when (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>3:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>God would justify the Gentiles by faith,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>he would make the Gentiles right by means of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">their</span> faith.</p></li><li><p>he would cause the non-Jews to be blameless/straight because they believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span>.</p></li><li><p>he will consider right the people who are not Jews. He will do this through their trust <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God would justify the Gentiles by faith:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>justify</em> means “cause/make to be acceptable/right.” The noun form of this word occurs in 3:6b. There it is translated as “righteousness.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God would make the non-Jewish people right through their faith (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God would consider the Gentiles straight by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">means of</span> their faith</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it is because of their faith/belief that God would regard the Gentiles as right/straight</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul’s point is that a person’s faith is the means by which he is made right with God. It is not by obeying the law.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause does not imply that God would justify the Jews by some other means. Here the focus is on the Gentiles.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">See justify in the Glossary for more information.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Gentiles:</strong> This is the same word that Paul used in 1:16b and 2:2b. It refers to non-Jewish people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>non-Jewish people (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also Gentiles, Meaning 1, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>by faith:</strong> In Greek, this is the same phrase as in 2:16d, 3:2c, and 3:5b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>by means of their faith <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if/when we they believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because of their belief/trust <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span></p></blockquote><h4>3:8c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:8c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and foretold the gospel to Abraham:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>So <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he</span> announced the good news to Abraham in advance when he said,</p></li><li><p>So <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he</span> told Abraham the good news before it happened. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">He</span> said,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God/He</span> told this good news to Abraham ahead of time. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">He</span> said that</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">There are several ways to interpret the way that 3:8c is connected to 3:8b:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>It is the result of 3:8b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So Scripture announced the Good News to Abraham ahead of time (GW) <em>(NJB, GNT, CEV, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is an additional statement that says something similar to 3:8b. According to this interpretation, these two clauses can be connected by (a) the conjunction “and” or (b) made into two separate sentences with no conjunction joining them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and announced the gospel in advance to Abraham (NIV) <em>(BSB, NIV, NLT, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and foretold the gospel to Abraham:</strong> The subject of the verb <em>foretold</em> is the noun “Scripture” in 3:8a. So this part of the verse is saying that “the Scripture foretold the gospel to Abraham.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">As mentioned in 3:8a, the written Scriptures did not yet exist when Abraham lived. So in this verse, it is best to understand “the Scripture” to mean “in the Scripture, God foretold” or “the God of Scripture foretold.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This Good News was told to Abraham beforehand, as the Scripture says (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Scripture says that God told this good news to Abraham before it happened</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and foretold the gospel:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>foretold the gospel</em> means “preached the gospel before it happened.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>announced the Good News to Abraham ahead of time (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>announced the future gospel (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the gospel:</strong> Paul often used the expression <em>the gospel</em> to refer to the good news of the Messiah’s death for our sins and his victory over death. Here Paul used <em>the gospel</em> in a much broader sense. Here it refers to salvation for everyone whom God justifies because of their faith. Salvation will be for all people, including Gentiles. This is also part of the good news.</p><h4>3:8d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:8d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“All nations will be blessed through you.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“All nations/people will be blessed because of you.”<sup>(sing)</sup></p></li><li><p>“<span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span> will give something good to the people of all the nations <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the world</span> through you.”</p></li><li><p>all nations would be blessed because of him. (CEV)</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>All nations will be blessed through you:</strong> This is a quotation from the book of Genesis. It occurs in Genesis 12:3, 18:18, and 22:18, with slight variations. In Genesis 22:18 the words “in/through your offspring” occur instead of just <em>through you</em>. These words help us understand that the blessing will reach all the peoples of the earth <u>through</u> one of Abraham’s descendants. We know that the descendant is Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This quotation is passive. Some ways to translate it are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a passive clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>All nations will be blessed in you (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>All nations will be blessed because of you</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Through you God will bless all people (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will cause/use you to bless all the people of the earth</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural to translate this quotation as indirect speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all nations would be blessed because of him (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he/God will bless all nations through him/Abraham</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>nations:</strong> In Greek, this word is the same as the word “Gentiles” in 3:8b. But here is has a broader meaning. Here it refers to the people of all nations. It includes Jews and non-Jews.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all the people of the world (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all people (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See Gentiles, Meaning 2 in the Glossary for more information.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>will be blessed:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>will be blessed</em> means “will be given something good” or “something good will be done to…” It can be a material or a spiritual thing.

He also blesses us when he gives us our daily food.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will be given good things</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will do good things to…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See bless, Meaning 1 in the Glossary for more information.</p>",

But Christ freed us from the curse of the law by his death on the cross. People who have faith in Christ receive a blessing instead of a curse. It was God’s purpose that by faith the Gentiles would share in the blessing of Abraham and receive the Spirit.</p></div><h4>3:10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>All who rely on works of the law are under a curse.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ However, all <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> who follow the law are condemned,</p></li><li><p>¶ But everyone who tries to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">be justified through</span> obeying the law will be judged.</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will punish everyone who tries to follow the law <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Moses</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in order to be made right with him</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In 3:8–9, Paul said that God will bless people who have faith. In 3:10, he gave the reason why it is necessary to rely on faith: a person who tries to rely on the law must keep the entire law or else be cursed. To show that he was giving a reason, Paul introduced this verse with a Greek conjunction that is often translated as “for.” Most English versions translate it that way.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">However, it is also possible to focus on the contrast between 3:8–9 and 3:10. There is a contrast between a blessing and a curse. There is also a contrast between people who have faith and people who follow the law.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to introduce the contrast are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>However</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>On the other hand</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The BSB has not translated this conjunction, and some other versions, such as the CEV and GNT, also do not translate it. In some languages, it will not be necessary to translate this conjunction either. Connect 3:10a to 3:9b in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>All who rely on works of the law:</strong> The phrase <em>works of the law</em> refers to obeying the law (to be justified). (This same phrase occurs in 2:16a.) People <em>who rely on works of the law</em> are those who rely/depend on their obedience to the law for their justification. In other words, they think that when they obey the law, they will be put right with God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who depend on following the law to make them right (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Anyone who tries to please God by obeying the Law (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Everyone who thinks that God will consider him right because he obeys the law <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Moses</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>are under a curse:</strong> This phrase means “are condemned,” “will be judged,” or “will be punished.” God is the one who will judge and punish. A <em>curse</em> is the opposite of the blessing that God gives to the people who have faith.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In this context, <em>a curse</em> may be different than a curse in animistic societies. In many societies, a person puts a curse on someone when he does sorcery or witchcraft against another person. Often this is done even when the person has not done anything wrong. Here, it is God, not witchcraft or sorcery, who will judge and punish a person for the wrong that he actually has done.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>are condemned</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>are under <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> anger</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will be punished <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by God</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will judge <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that person</span></p></blockquote><h4>3:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For it is written:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because the Scripture says,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They will be judged</span> because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in God’s Holy Book</span> it is written,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We know this</span> because the Scriptures say,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>For</em> introduces Paul’s basis/support for saying that the people in 3:10a are under a curse. They are under a curse (3:10a) <u>because</u> the Bible says that they are under a curse (3:10b).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to introduce the reason are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They are under a curse</span> because</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We know this</span> because</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it will be more natural to put the reason first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>10b</sup>It is written, <sup>10c</sup>“Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.” <sup>10a</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">So</span> all who rely on works of the law are under a curse.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it is written:</strong> This phrase introduces a quotation from the Old Testament. The quotation is from Deuteronomy 27:26.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to introduce this quotation are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>here is what the Scripture says</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in God’s Holy Book it is written</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we read in the Scriptures that</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul quoted this verse in order to prove that God will judge everyone who tries to be justified by keeping the law. God, through Moses, had warned his people that the result of not completely obeying the law is condemnation.</p><h4>3:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“All people who do not follow everything written in the law book are condemned.”</p></li><li><p>“Everyone who does not keep all the laws in the books that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Moses</span> wrote will be judged.”</p></li><li><p>“<span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will punish anyone who does not obey all the commandments that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Moses</span> wrote in the law books.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Cursed is:</strong> This phrase is the verb form of the noun “curse” in 3:10a. It has the same meaning of “judge” or “punish.” It is God who will judge and punish.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is natural to put this phrase at the end of the sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Whoever does not always obey everything that is written in the book of the Law is under God’s curse! (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>everything written in the Book of the Law:</strong> The phrase <em>the Law</em> refers to the laws/commandments that God gave to Moses. Moses wrote these laws in the first five books of the Old Testament.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate these phrases are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all the laws in the books that Moses wrote</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all the commands written in the law <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of God</span></p></blockquote><h4>3:10a–c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:10a–c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(reordered) It is written, “</strong><span data-bnType=\"implied\"><strong>God</strong></span><strong> will punish anyone who does not obey all the commandments that </strong><span data-bnType=\"implied\"><strong>Moses</strong></span><strong> wrote in the law books.” </strong><span data-bnType=\"implied\"><strong>So</strong></span><strong> </strong><span data-bnType=\"implied\"><strong>God</strong></span><strong> will punish everyone who tries to follow the law </strong><span data-bnType=\"implied\"><strong>of Moses</strong></span><strong> </strong><span data-bnType=\"implied\"><strong>in order to be made right with him</strong></span><strong>.</strong></p></div>",

The basis for 3:11a is a verse from Scripture.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to show the connection are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because the scripture says (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is natural to put the basis first.

It means that those people whom God declares righteous because of their faith will live. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Only the person who is put right with God through faith shall live (GNT) <em>(GNT, RSV, REB, CEV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is connected with the <u>verb</u> <em>live</em>. It means that those people who are righteous will live because of their faith. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Those who are right with God will live by faith (NCV) <em>(BSB, NIV, ESV, NET, NRSV, NJB, KJV, NASB, GW, JBP, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Throughout Galatians, Paul has connected righteousness and faith. God makes people righteous because of their faith, not because they follow the law.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It appears that more versions follow interpretation (2). But it is possible that some are simply ambiguous and do not intend to exclude interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The person whom God makes right because of his faith will live.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The people who believe in God are made right. These people will live.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>The righteous:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>The righteous</em> refers to a righteous person. It is a person whom God has declared right/straight. The word righteous is the noun form of the verb “justified” in 3:11a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The person who is justified</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The person who is blameless</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The one who is made right/straight</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural to use the plural word “people” here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The people who are made right/straight</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also righteous in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>will live:</strong> The verb <em>will live</em> refers to living/being in a good relationship with God. It is living for and with God both here on earth and after death. It does not refer to remaining alive on the earth.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this verb are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will really live</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will have true/genuine life</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>lives in right relationship with God (The Message)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will live forever (Easy-to-Read Version)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Languages have many ways to express the idea of <em>live</em>. In some languages, the idea of <em>live</em> is expressed by the verb “sit,” “stay,” or “be with someone.” Other languages use a metaphor such as “walk.” Those languages may have to translate <em>will live</em> by something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will sit/stay/be well</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will walk <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with God</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will have a relationship with God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>by faith:</strong> The phrase <em>by faith</em> means that a person will be made righteous because of his faith/belief in God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>through faith</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because of his faith/believing</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See faith, Meaning 1 in the Glossary.</p>",

They had forgotten that they had been made right with God (justified) and had received the Holy Spirit by believing. They should not then begin to do/obey the law to be made right with God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Being made right with God (justification) has always been an issue of believing. Abraham himself was justified because he believed. People who are Abraham’s children are those who believe. They are the ones who are blessed. People who try to be made right with God by obeying the law are cursed, because no one can obey the entire law.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul wanted the Galatians to change their ways. He was convinced that if they thought about their actions and understood the truth, they would change.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other examples for a heading for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Justification by Law or by Faith?

But Christ freed us from the curse of the law by his death on the cross. People who have faith in Christ receive a blessing instead of a curse. It was God’s purpose that by faith the Gentiles would share in the blessing of Abraham and receive the Spirit.</p></div><h4>3:12a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:12a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The law, however, is not based on faith;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">obeying</span> the law is not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a matter</span> of believing <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in God</span>,</p></li><li><p>There is a difference between <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the person who obeys</span> the law and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the person who</span> believes <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in God</span>.</p></li><li><p>Faith does not go together with <span data-bnType=\"implied\">obeying</span> the law.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The law, however, is not based on faith:</strong> In 3:12, Paul developed his argument that a person who is righteous by faith will live. He did this by stating that faith and the law do not go together. Paul introduced this contrast between “faith” (in 3:11b) and <em>the law</em> (in 3:12) by beginning this verse with a Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>however</em>. Here are some other ways to introduce this contrast:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Yet (NKJV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions, such as the NIV and the NLT, do not explicitly show this contrast with a conjunction. In some languages, no conjunction will be necessary here either. Connect 3:12a to 3:11b in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>The law…is not based on faith:</strong> The word <em>law</em> refers to “obeying/keeping the law in order to be made right with God.” So this clause means that obeying the law is not a matter of faith/believing/trusting in Jesus. As the next clause says, obeying the law is a matter of what a person “does.” The law focuses only on doing things. The law excludes faith.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The law does not depend on faith (NAB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">obeying</span> the law is not a matter of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">having</span> faith <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in God/Jesus</span>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Belief does not go together with <span data-bnType=\"implied\">obeying</span> the law.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>There is a difference between obeying the law and believing.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>faith:</strong> See faith, Meaning 1 in the Glossary.</p><h4>3:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>on the contrary,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>rather, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">it is a matter of doing/obedience,</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as the Scripture says,</span></p></li><li><p>Instead <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of believing, the law is based on obedience.</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">It is written in Scripture,</span></p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It is written in the Scripture,</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>on the contrary:</strong> There is a contrast between 3:12a and 3:12b–c. The contrast is between what the law is not (it is not of faith), and what the law is (it is doing/obeying the commandments). Languages have different ways to indicate this negative-positive type of contrast.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>One of the functions of the Greek conjunction <em>ἀλλά</em> is to signal this negative-positive type of contrast.</span></span> Some of the ways are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>With the conjunction “but.”</p></li><li><p>With a conjunction other than “but.” This is a common way in English to show this type of contrast. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>rather (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>on the contrary (BSB, NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Instead (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>With no conjunction. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>a</sup>The Law isn’t based on faith. <sup>c</sup>It promises life only to people who obey its commands. (CEV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be necessary to include some implicit information to make this contrast more understandable. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>On the contrary, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">it is a matter of doing/obeying</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Instead <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of faith</span>, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the law is based on</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">obedience to it</span></p></blockquote><h4>3:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“The man who does these things will live by them.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“The person who does/obeys laws will live <span data-bnType=\"implied\">well</span> because of them.”</p></li><li><p>“He who does/obeys <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all</span> the commandments <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the law of Moses</span> will have <span data-bnType=\"implied\">real/eternal</span> life because of the commandments <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he obeys</span>.”</p></li><li><p>“The person who obeys the laws will sit/walk <span data-bnType=\"implied\">well</span> because he obeyed them.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Verse 3:12c is a quote from Leviticus 18:5. In some languages, it may be good to make explicit that this is a quote from the Old Testament. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as the scripture says (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul quoted this Scripture to support his statement that obeying the law does not include faith. The law has always focused on what a person <em>does</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The man who does these things will live by them:</strong> The phrase <em>does these things</em> means “does/obeys the commandments in the law of Moses.” The phrase <em>will live by them</em> means “will live well because of obeying these laws.” People who diligently obeyed all the laws of Moses would find a good life both here on earth and eternally.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this quote are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He who does/obeys <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all</span> the commandments will have <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a good</span> life because he obeyed them.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Whoever does <u>everything</u> the Law requires will live. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>A person who obeys these things will live because of them. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>If you wish to find life by obeying the law, you must obey <u>all of</u> its commands. (NLT96)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>The man who:</strong> This is a way to refer to people in general. You should use a natural way in your language to make a general statement.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some possible ways are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The person/people who</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Anyone who</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You who</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He who</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>will live by them:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>will live by them</em> means “will live well because of obeying these laws.” In the context of Leviticus, these words probably meant that people who diligently obeyed all the laws would find a good life here on earth. They would have peace within their community, and God would bless them. But this phrase could also refer to an eternal life with God.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Moo says, “The ‘life’ in view here, as typically in the Pentateuch in these kinds of texts, is the blessing of God’s covenant promises: health, fruitful crops, security in the land (‘a happy life in which a man enjoys God’s bounty of health, children, friends, and prosperity’…). This verse is frequently quoted later in the OT and in Judaism with a similar purpose; in places it takes on a more spiritual interpretation of ‘life,’ even at times explicitly eternal life…” (p. 208).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will live because of them (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will live because of the laws he obeys (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will have a good life because he did/obeyed all the laws</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">As with the words “will live” in 3:11b, languages have many ways to talk about <em>will live</em> here. Some other ways that languages may translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will sit/stay well because he obeyed the laws</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will walk well because of obeying the laws</p></blockquote>",

God condemned and punished sin.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul applied this verse to Christ. Christ died by being crucified. Death by crucifixion means that his body was hung on a cross. A cross can be referred to as a tree since it is made from wood. The fact that Christ was crucified is God’s way of showing us that Christ became the curse for us.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">By the time of Christ, a person was hung on a tree/cross in order to kill him. In the Old Testament, the person hung on a tree was already dead.

The meaning is very similar to 3:9a–b, “those who have faith are blessed along with Abraham.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">You should use a verb in your language that is natural to use with the word “blessing.” In some languages, blessings do not <em>come</em> to people. They are “given” or “received.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>might be received by the Gentiles</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God might give the same blessing to the Gentiles</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God has blessed the Gentiles with the same blessing he promised to Abraham (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Gentiles:</strong> The word <em>Gentiles</em> refers to all people who were not Jews.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the people who are not Jews</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>non-Jews</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See Gentiles, Meaning 1 in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in Christ Jesus:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>in Christ Jesus</em> is the means by which God blessed the Gentiles. He blessed them “by” or “through” Christ Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believing in</span> Christ Jesus</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>through <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that which</span> Christ Jesus <span data-bnType=\"implied\">has done</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it will be more natural to put this phrase earlier in 3:14b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>in Christ Jesus</u> the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ Jesus:</strong> In the phrase <em>Christ Jesus</em>, <em>Christ</em> is his title and <em>Jesus</em> is his personal name.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">One way to show this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Christ/Messiah Jesus</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions follow the Greek order here and translate these two words as <em>Christ Jesus</em>. However, in 1:1c, Paul used the phrase “Jesus Christ.” Both <em>Christ Jesus</em> and “Jesus Christ” refer to the same person. So here it is also possible to put Jesus before Christ. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Jesus Christ (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>3:14c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:14c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">and</span> so that</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ also redeemed us</span> in order that</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He also did this</span> so that</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>so that</em> introduces the second purpose for which Christ redeemed us (in 3:14d).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><sup>13a</sup>He redeemed us</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><sup>14a</sup>in order that</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><sup>14b</sup>we might receive the blessing promised to Abraham</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><sup>14c</sup> <u>and so that</u></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><sup>14d</sup>we might receive the Spirit.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to connect this part of the verse to the rest of the verse are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">and</span> so that</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He also redeemed us</span> so that</p></blockquote><h4>3:14d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:14d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>we might receive the promised Spirit by means of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">our</span> faith.</p></li><li><p>we would receive the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Holy</span> Spirit <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that God</span> promised <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to give to us</span> because of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">our</span> believing.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> would sent us the Holy Spirit that he promised. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">We receive this Holy Spirit</span> because we believe.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by faith:</strong> This phrase refers to the way a person receives the Spirit.

God promised to give the Holy Spirit to those who believe. The promise referred to is probably the passage from Joel 2:28–29 that is quoted in Acts 2:17–18.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we could receive the Spirit that God promised (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we might receive the Spirit <span data-bnType=\"implied\">whom God</span> promised <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to give us</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Spirit is another blessing of justification by faith.

Paul introduced this background information with a Greek conjunction that most English versions translate as “now.” In this context, “now” is not a time word.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The BSB has not translated this conjunction, and some other versions, such as the NIV and NLT, also do not translate it. In some languages, it will not be necessary to translate this conjunction either. Connect 3:16a to 3:15b in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The promises were spoken to Abraham:</strong> Here Paul compared a “covenant” that men make (in 3:15b) to the promises that God made to Abraham. Paul had referred to that promise in 3:8d when he quoted Genesis 12:3.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>were spoken</em> is passive. Some ways to translate this clause are:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use a passive clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the promises were made to Abraham (RSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God made his promises to Abraham (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and to his seed:</strong> The word that the BSB translates as <em>seed</em> means “descendant” in this context. This word is singular. Paul used the singular of seed because he was referring to Jesus Christ. You must use a singular form for this word in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and to his descendant (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>3:16b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:16b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The Scripture does not say, “and to seeds,” meaning many,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Scripture does not say <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the words</span> “and to his descendants,” as if it talks about many of them.</p></li><li><p>God did not say, “and to your descendants.” That would mean many people.

If that is the case in your language, you can say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The scripture does not use the plural (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God did not say (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>“and to seeds,” meaning many:</strong> In this clause, Paul explained the last phrase of the Scripture quotation that he referred to in 3:16a. He said that Scripture did not use the plural <em>seeds</em>. It did not refer to many people. You must use a plural form for <em>seeds</em> here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>“to his descendants,” as if it meant many of them</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>“and to your descendants.” That would mean many people. (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>3:16c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:16c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but “and to your seed,” meaning One, who is Christ.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Rather, Scripture talks about one person. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">It says,</span> “And to his descendant.” That descendant is Christ.</p></li><li><p>But God said, “and to your descendant.” That means only one person; that person is Christ.

The contrast is between what Scripture did not say (“seeds”) and what it did say (<em>seed</em>). Languages have different ways to indicate this negative-positive order of contrast.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>As in 3:12b, one of the functions of the Greek conjunction <em>ἀλλά</em> is to signal this negative-positive type of contrast.</span></span> Some of the ways are:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>With the conjunction “but.”</p></li><li><p>With a conjunction other than “but.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Rather (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Instead</p></blockquote></li><li><p>With no conjunction. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>b</sup>The Scripture did not say “and to descendants.” <sup>c</sup>It said “and to your descendant.”</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>“and to your seed,” meaning One, who is Christ:</strong> In this clause Paul stated that Scripture used the singular word <em>seed</em>. This refers to one person. He explicitly said who is the one descendant of Abraham through whom the promise comes. That descendant is Jesus Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it says “to his descendant.” It is one person.

However, in some languages, it may be more natural to use the pronoun “his” here. This will correspond better with the quote “his seed” in 3:16a.

In the first part (3:15–18), Paul explained what the law was not intended to do. It was not intended to cancel or replace the blessing that God had promised to give to Abraham.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In the second part (3:19–25), Paul explained what the law was meant to do, how it was given, and how it was limited. It was limited as to what it could accomplish in people’s lives. And it was limited as to the time period during which it would govern God’s people.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other examples for a heading for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The law and the promise</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The promise preceded the law</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The law does not change the promise</p></blockquote></div><h4>3:18a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> Verse 3:18 is an explanation of 3:15–17. In this verse Paul explained why the law cannot cancel God’s promises. The Greek introduces this explanation with a conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>For</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to introduce this explanation is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I say this</span> because</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions do not translate this conjunction. In some languages, it will not be necessary to translate this conjunction either.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on a promise:</strong> This sentence has a special type of “if” clause. In this “if” clause, Paul stated the opposite of what is true. The truth is that the inheritance (blessing) does <u>not</u> come by obeying the law. If it did come by the law, that would cancel the promise.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages have a special way to translate this type of “if” sentence. Some examples are listed below. After the examples, each part of this verse is discussed.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this sentence are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use an “if” clause that indicates the opposite of what is true.

God’s people receive this inheritance/blessing as a result of his promise to bless them through Jesus, the special descendant of Abraham.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if inheriting <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s blessings</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>If…God’s blessings (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we received</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> blessing</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if God’s gift (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>inheritance</em> does not refer to a human inheritance that is passed on to a person’s descendants after he dies.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>depends on the law:</strong> This clause means that the inheritance “comes by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">keeping</span> the law <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Moses</span>.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>is based on the law (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>could be received by keeping the law (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>comes from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">obeying</span> the law <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Moses</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because we obey the law</p></blockquote><h4>3:18b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:18b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>then it no longer depends on a promise;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>then it would not be the result of accepting God’s promise.

The BSB indicates this contrast with the conjunction <em>but</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God freely granted it to Abraham through a promise:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>freely granted</em> means “graciously/kindly gave.” God kindly gave the inheritance to Abraham simply because he promised it to him.

Paul used this rhetorical question to begin a new section. He had just talked about the things that the law cannot do.

Two of the main ways are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The purpose of the law is to <u>define</u> transgressions/sins. It identifies sin and tells us what sin is. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in order to show what wrongdoing is (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to show people their sins (NLT) <em>(GNT, NLT, GW, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The purpose of the law is to <u>deal</u> with transgressions/sins. The law told the Jews what sacrifices to make to atone for their sins. It also told them what the punishment was for sin. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to deal with crimes (NJB) <em>(NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you choose interpretation (1). In the previous section, Paul told the Galatians what the law could not do.

It indicates that the law had an end point. It was in force until the <em>seed</em> (Christ) came. This statement would have surprised the Jews. They expected the law to last forever.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word that the BSB translates as <em>seed</em> is the same word that Paul used in 3:16. It refers to Jesus Christ the offspring or descendant of Abraham.

God gave the law to men. But he did not give it directly. He gave it to angels. Then angels gave it to Moses. Then Moses gave it to the people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a passive clause.

In the first part (3:15–18), Paul explained what the law was not intended to do. It was not intended to cancel or replace the blessing that God had promised to give to Abraham.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In the second part (3:19–25), Paul explained what the law was meant to do, how it was given, and how it was limited. It was limited as to what it could accomplish in people’s lives. And it was limited as to the time period during which it would govern God’s people.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other examples for a heading for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The law and the promise</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The promise preceded the law</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The law does not change the promise</p></blockquote></div><h4>3:20</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In this verse Paul contrasted the work of a mediator (which involves two parties) and the oneness of God. Paul used this contrast to say that the law is inferior to the promise. God did not give the law directly to his people. He gave it through Moses, the mediator. But with the promise, God alone made a promise. And made it directly with Abraham. This shows that the promise is more important than the law.</p><h4>3:20a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:20a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>A mediator is unnecessary, however, for only one party;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>A mediator does not work with only one person.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">So</span> the law did not come directly from God.

Paul introduced this background information with a Greek conjunction that most English versions translate as “now.” In this context, “now” is not a time word. The BSB translates this conjunction as <em>however</em>, as does the NIV.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other versions, such as the CEV and GW, do not translate this conjunction. In some languages, it will not be necessary to translate it either. Connect 3:20a to 3:19e in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>A mediator is unnecessary…for only one party:</strong> In Greek, this clause is more literally “the intermediary is not of one.” This means that when a mediator is involved, there is more than one side/party in the agreement or discussion.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This implies that when God gave the law, he gave it through a mediator (Moses) to his people. He did not give it directly.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>A mediator does not work with just one person.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Now a mediator is helpful if more than one party must reach an agreement.

It emphasizes that the law is <u>not</u> contrary to the promises. Paul used this rhetorical question to correct a wrong conclusion that some readers might have drawn from what he had just said.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The words <em>opposed to</em> mean that the law is not “contrary to” or “against” the promises.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this emphasis are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Is the law then against the promises of God? (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Well then, is there a conflict between God’s law and God’s promises? (NLT96)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now then, the law is certainly not opposed to the promises of God.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a command. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not think/conclude that the law is against the promises of God.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use whichever form is most natural in your language to emphasize something.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>then:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB here translates as <em>then</em> can also be translated as “therefore” (as in the NIV). This conjunction introduces a conclusion. Here the idea is, “Can we conclude that the law is against the promises of God?”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this conjunction are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Does this mean (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>therefore (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So</p></blockquote><h4>3:21b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:21b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Certainly not!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Absolutely not!</p></li><li><p>Not at all! <span data-bnType=\"implied\">But it is different.</span></p></li><li><p>It is not! <span data-bnType=\"implied\">But the function of the law is different than the function of the promises.</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Certainly not!:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>Certainly not!</em> is a strong response “No!” to the rhetorical question.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Never!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Absolutely not!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>No, no, no! <span data-bnType=\"implied\">But it is different.</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause also occurs in 2:17. You can translate it in the same way here.</p><h4>3:21c–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> Verse 3:21c–d explains why it is wrong to conclude that the law is against the promise (3:21a). It explains more about the relationship between the law and the promise. They do not have the same function. They are both part of God’s plan, but the law does not give life. The Greek introduces this explanation with a conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>For</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be necessary to make this more explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They are not opposed, but they are different,</span> because</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The purpose of the law is different than the purpose of the promise.</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I say this</span> because</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">(In the Display, this implicit information has been put in 3:21b.)</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come from the law:</strong> This sentence has a special type of “if” clause. In this “if” clause, Paul stated the opposite of what is true. The truth is that there is no law given that can give life.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages have a special way to translate this type of “if” sentence. Some examples are listed below. After the examples, each part of this verse is discussed.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this sentence are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As an “if” sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if human beings had received a law that could bring life, then everyone could be put right with God by obeying it (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a true statement followed by the conclusion. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Righteousness certainly does not come by means of the law that was given, so the law cannot give life.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>By stating the conclusion first and then stating the conditional clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The law that was given cannot give life. If it could <span data-bnType=\"implied\">give life</span>, then righteousness would certainly have come by means of obeying the law.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a rhetorical question followed by the consequence.

The contrast is between what the law cannot do (give life) and what the law does (imprisons/confines). Languages have different ways to indicate this negative-positive order of contrast. Some of the ways are:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>With the conjunction “but.”</p></li><li><p>With a conjunction other than “but.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Rather</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Instead (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>With no conjunction.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Scripture pronounces all things confined by sin:</strong> In this clause, Paul spoke about <em>the Scripture</em> as if it were a judge who condemns people to prison/jail, and Paul spoke about <em>sin</em> as if it were a jailer who has control over prisoners.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Fung says, “The <em>positive</em> aspect of the law’s function is stated with the help of the figure of a jail sentence, with Scripture as the magistrate…and sin as the jailer who carries out the sentence” (p. 164).</span></span> These are two figures of speech called personification.

So here the phrase <em>the Scripture</em> is a way to refer to the law.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The law tells people what sin is. It says that when someone sins, he is guilty. In that sense, Scripture is like a judge who says/declares that people are guilty. The law also shows people that they are under the power of sin.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the scripture says that (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">law written in</span> Scripture tells us that</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God in</span> his holy book says that</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">they wrote in</span> God’s book that</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>all things:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>all things</em> refers to everything that God created.

Just as prisoners do what the jailer says, human beings do what sin tells them to do. Sin controls them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a prisoner of sin (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>controlled by the power of sin (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>under the power of sin (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the desire to sin controls everyone</p></blockquote><h4>3:22b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:22b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that by faith in Jesus Christ the promise might be given to those who believe.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>in order that what was promised through faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</p></li><li><p>so that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> might give <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the blessing</span> to those who believe. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">This is the blessing that he</span> promised through faith in Jesus Christ.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This has happened</span> so that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> might give the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">blessing that he</span> promised to those who believe in Jesus Christ.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>so that</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It introduces God’s <u>purpose</u> for imprisoning people under sin. His purpose is to give people the promise by means of their faith in Jesus.

So in these phrases, to have <em>faith in Jesus Christ</em> is the same thing as to <em>believe</em> in him. The same idea is repeated. People receive the promise by (or because of) their faith/belief in Jesus Christ. And God gives the promise to people who believe.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul repeated the idea of believing to add emphasis. He emphasized that believing in Jesus is what is important. It is more important than obeying the law.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it will not be natural to repeat the idea of believing. So the phrase <em>faith in Jesus Christ</em> and the phrase <em>those who believe</em> can be translated as one. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s promises will be for anyone who has faith in Jesus Christ (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will give the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">blessing that he</span> promised to people who believe in Jesus Christ.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>faith:</strong> See faith, Meaning 1, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the promise might be given:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>might be given</em> is passive.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this clause are:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Use a passive verb.

The role of the law is finished because Christ has come. He pointed out that once people have become children of God, they are entitled to all the blessings of the new life in Christ. He reminded the Christians in Galatia that they became children of God through faith.

He connected this verse to the previous verses with a Greek conjunction that many English versions translate as “now.” In this context, “now” is not a time word.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The BSB has not translated this conjunction, and some other versions, such as the NIV and NLT, also do not translate it. In some languages, it will not be necessary to translate this conjunction either. Connect 3:23a to 3:22b in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Before this faith came:</strong> The word <em>faith</em> refers to “faith in Jesus Christ” (from 3:22b). So this clause refers to the time before people could be made right with God through faith/believing in Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to translate this clause is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Before <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the way of</span> faith <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span> came</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is not natural to say that faith <em>came</em>. In other languages, <em>faith</em> must be translated as a verb. In those languages, some ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>before the time of believing/trusting <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>before the time arrived <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when people could</span> believe/trust <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ in whom people should</span> believe/trust had not yet come</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See faith, Meaning 1 in the Glossary.</p><h4>3:23b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:23b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>we were held in custody under the law,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>we were held by the law</p></li><li><p>the law was <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> a guard who kept us in prison.</p></li><li><p>we were <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> prisoners whom the law guarded.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we were held in custody under the law:</strong> The words <em>held in custody</em> mean “held captive,” “held prisoners,” “confined,” or “guarded.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a passive clause. Some ways to translate this clause are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a passive clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we were held prisoners by the law (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we were placed under guard by the law (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As an active clause.

In this figure of speech, Paul spoke of the law as if it were a prison guard who guarded people in prison. In some languages, it is not natural to keep this personification. Some ways to translate this clause without using personification are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the law was like a guard who held us in prison</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we were like prisoners whom the law guarded</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In your translation, do not use a word that implies “protected.”</p><h4>3:23c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:23c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>locked up until faith should be revealed.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>as prisoners until the coming <span data-bnType=\"implied\">way of</span> faith was made known.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The law</span> controlled us until the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">time</span> came <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when</span> believing/trusting <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span> was shown <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to us</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It</span> had power over us until the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">time</span> came <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when God</span> revealed/showed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to us</span> that we should/must believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>locked up:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>locked up</em> is the same Greek word as in 3:22a, where the BSB translates it as “confined.” You should translate it in a similar way or in the same way as you did there. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>confined</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>under the power of</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>controlled</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be necessary to begin a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We were locked up</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The law kept us in prison</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>until faith should be revealed:</strong> This clause refers to a particular period of time. It is the time that lasted up to the time when God revealed/showed the way of faith in Christ. That time happened when Christ came. When it happened, the time ended during which people were prisoners to the law. The time of the law ended.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a passive clause. Some ways to translate this clause are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a passive clause.

It was in charge of us until Christ came,</p></li><li><p>The law controlled us until Christ came.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So:</strong> In 3:24, Paul used another figure of speech to explain further what he had already said about the law in the previous verses.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek conjunction that Paul used here normally indicates result. That is why some English versions begin this verse with the conjunction <em>So</em>. However, here, it is better to see 3:24 as simply another figure of speech to explain the role of the law.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to introduce this verse are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Let me put it another way (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In other words (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Or, to change the metaphor (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Also</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions do not use a conjunction here. In some languages, a conjunction will not be necessary either.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the law became our guardian:</strong> This is a metaphor. In this metaphor, the law is compared to a <em>guardian</em>. The word <em>guardian</em> refers to a slave who was put in charge of his master’s child. This word is further defined below.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The law and a guardian are similar in that both (harshly) control someone for a temporary period of time. Just as a guardian controlled a child until he became an adult, so also the law controlled people until Christ came.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this metaphor are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Moses’ laws served as our guardian (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the law <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Moses</span> watched over us</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate it as a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the law can be compared to someone who watches over a child</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the law was like a slave who was in charge of a child</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without using a figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Law controlled us (CEV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>guardian:</strong> The word <em>guardian</em> refers to a slave who was put in charge of his master’s child. (The child was about 6 to 16 years of age.) The slave’s job was to discipline the child. He made sure that the child did what he was required to do, including going to school. He did this until the child became an adult. Guardians were often very strict. Sometimes they would slap, beat, whip, or pinch the child to punish and correct him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It was not the responsibility of a guardian to teach the child formally. Other people were the child’s teachers. So words such as “teacher” or “schoolmaster” are not good words to translate this Greek word.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the word <em>guardian</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>child-watcher</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>slave in charge of a child</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural to translate the noun <em>guardian</em> as a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Law was in charge of us until Christ came (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the law was <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like a person who was</span> in control of us until Christ came</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to lead us to Christ:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>to lead us to Christ</em> is literally just “to Christ.” There are two ways to interpret this phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to the <u>time</u> of Christ’s coming. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>until Christ came (NIV11) <em>(NIV11, RSV, ESV, GNT, CEV, NET, REB, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to the <u>purpose</u> of having the law as a guardian. The purpose was to lead people to Christ. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to lead us to Christ (NIV) <em>(BSB, NIV, KJV, NASB, NCV, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This interpretation fits the context well. In this paragraph, Paul was talking about the temporary role of the law. The time of the law ended when the time of faith in Christ came.</p><h4>3:24b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:24b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that we might be justified by faith.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that we could be justified through faith.</p></li><li><p>so that, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when he came,</span> we could be made right/blameless through faith.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It did this</span> so that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">after he came</span> God would make us right because of our faith.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that we might be justified by faith:</strong> This is a purpose clause. There are two things that this could be the purpose of:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is the purpose of <u>all of 3:24a</u>. The law had a role, but it was only temporary. It was temporary so that we might be justified by faith. We could not be justified by following the law. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>a</sup>the Law was in charge of us until Christ came, <sup>b</sup>in order that we might then be put right with God through faith (GNT) <em>(BSB, NIV11, ESV, GNT, RSV, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is the purpose of <u>Christ’s coming</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>a</sup>Before Christ came, Moses’ laws served as our guardian. <sup>b</sup>Christ came so that we could receive God’s approval because of faith. (GW)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). It is a suitable way to understand the Greek grammar.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when Christ arrived,</span> we might be justified by faith</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The law did this</span> so that we might be justified by faith.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we might be justified by faith:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>justified</em> means “cause/make to be acceptable/right.” This same verb occurs in 3:8b and 3:11a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This verb is passive. Some ways to translate this clause are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we might be made right by/through faith <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in him/God</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we could be accepted as righteous by God because of our faith</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As an active. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> would make us right through faith</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> would consider us straight because of our faith</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">See also justify in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>by faith:</strong> The phrase <em>by faith</em> means that a person will be made righteous because of his faith/belief in God. This same phrase occurs in 3:11b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>through faith</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because of his faith/believing</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See faith, Meaning 1 in the Glossary.</p>",

In this section, he returned to focus on the non-Jews whom he had talked about earlier.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section has two parts. In the first one (3:26 to 3:29), Paul reminded the non-Jewish Christians in Galatia that they had become children of God through faith. When people become children of God, there is no longer a difference between Jew or non-Jew, male or female, slave or free.

It is no longer necessary to follow the law.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other examples for a heading for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>By faith we are sons of God and are rescued from the law</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You are not slaves but children of God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No longer prisoners to the law but sons</p></blockquote></div><h4>3:26</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:26\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ In/Through Christ, all of you are sons of God by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">means of</span> believing.</p></li><li><p>¶ All of you who are united with Christ Jesus are God’s children because you believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Jesus</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In 3:26, Paul further explained the faith in Christ that he had talked about in 3:24–25. He introduced this further explanation with a Greek conjunction that most English versions translate as “for.” Here is another way to translate this conjunction:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The BSB has not translated this conjunction, and some other versions, such as the GNT and GW, also do not translate it. In some languages, it will not be necessary to translate this conjunction either. Connect 3:26 to 3:25b in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus:</strong> There are two ways to interpret how the phrase <em>in Christ Jesus</em> fits in this clause:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It <u>modifies the whole clause</u>. This means that the believer is united with Christ and this makes him a son/child. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith. (NIV11) <em>(NIV11, NET, RSV, REB, ESV, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It <u>modifies through faith</u>. It states that the object of faith is Jesus Christ. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. (NIV) <em>(BSB, NIV, KJV, NASB, CEV, GNT, GW, NCV, NLT, JBP)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Here Paul used the phrase <em>in Christ</em> as in other passages to mean “in union with Christ.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In/Through Christ Jesus you are all sons of God through faith <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in him</span>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>All of you who are united with Christ Jesus are sons of God because you believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sons of God:</strong> This phrase refers to all people who believe in Christ. They are both male and female. After a person has believed in Christ, God considers him as his child.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>children of God (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sons and daughters of God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>through faith:</strong> Some other ways to translate <em>through faith</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because of your faith (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because you believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Jesus</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>by believing (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">A similar phrase also occurs in 3:14d. See also faith, Meaning 1 in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ Jesus:</strong> In the phrase <em>Christ Jesus</em>, <em>Christ</em> is his title and <em>Jesus</em> is his personal name. One way to show this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Christ/Messiah Jesus</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In 1:1c, Paul used the phrase “Jesus Christ.” Both <em>Christ Jesus</em> and “Jesus Christ” refer to the same person. Either order may be used in your translation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase also occurs in 3:14a. You should translate it here as you did there.</p>",

In some languages, it will not be necessary to translate this conjunction either. Connect 4:2a to 4:1d in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He is subject to guardians and trustees:</strong> In this clause, Paul clarified how the heir is no different from a slave when he is a child. He is no different because he too is under the authority of other people.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He must obey the people who take care of him</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>guardians:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>guardians</em> refers to people whom the father has appointed to look after his son when he is young. These people have authority to give the son orders.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>men who take care of him (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people who are in charge of him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>protectors</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This word is similar to the word translated as “guardian” in 3:24a.

The time of the law is over.</p></div><h4>4:3–7</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 4:3–7, Paul explained the meaning of his illustration in 4:1–2. In the same way that a future heir is surrounded by guardians and is like a slave when he is a child, Jewish and Gentile believers had been slaves of sin. God the Father decided the right time to change this situation. This happened when he sent his Son. After God’s Son had redeemed us, believers became sons and received the full inheritance as sons. They were no longer slaves.</p><h4>4:3a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:3a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So also, when we were children,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It was the same way with us<sup>(incl)</sup> also.

We were <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> children.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So also, when we were children:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>So also, when we were children</em> introduces Paul’s explanation of his illustration in 4:1–2. In his explanation, Paul compared Jewish and Gentile believers to the heir in 4:1–2. He referred to their lives before they believed as a time when they were like children. He compared their lives at that time to the life of an heir when he is a child.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>That is how it was with us. We were like children (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It is the same for us. We were once like children (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And that’s the way it was with us before Christ came.

It refers to both Jewish and non-Jewish believers and should be an inclusive <em>we</em>.</p></li><li><p>It refers to <u>Jewish believers</u> only and should be an exclusive <em>we</em>.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), as the majority of commentators do. Here Paul was no longer talking about Jewish slavery under the law of Moses. He was talking about a more general slavery to the “basic principles of the world” (4:3b).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Also in support of this interpretation is the fact that in 4:9, Paul rebuked the Gentiles for returning to the basic principles of the world. Therefore, the Gentiles must have been included in <em>we</em> who had been slaves to those principles in 4:3b.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In 4:4b and 4:5a, Paul mentioned those who are required to obey the law. This might suggest that here in 4:3a Paul was thinking of the Jews only.

God’s Son freed us from slavery to the law.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>buy freedom (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>pay for the freedom (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to release/free <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by becoming a sacrifice</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This same word occurs in 3:13a.

This clause certainly refers to Jews who were required to obey the many commandments in the law of Moses. This clause may also refer to Gentiles, who also lived under certain religious laws. These laws were like their master.

The BSB connects this verse to the previous verse with the conjunction <em>And</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions do not begin this sentence with such a conjunction. In some languages, it will not be necessary to begin this sentence with such a conjunction either.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because you are sons:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>because</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>because</u>. According to this interpretation, this word is a conjunction and introduces the reason why God has given us the Spirit. Paul is saying that <u>because</u> we are his children, God has given us the Spirit.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Elsewhere in his writings, “Paul has argued from his converts’ reception of the Spirit (3:2–5, 14b) to their being “sons of God” (3:26), which is also the order of his presentation in Rom 8:15–17. Here, however, that relationship seems to be reversed in saying ‘because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his son into your hearts’ (4:6).…The argument as to whether the proper order is first sonship and then the gift of the Spirit, or first the reception of the Spirit and then sonship, has been fervent and heated.…Clearly, <em>Ὅτι</em> here is causal (because, since)…Paul is not here setting out stages in the Christian life, whether logical or chronological. Rather his emphasis is on the reciprocal relation or correlational nature of sonship and the reception of the Spirit” (Longenecker, p. 173).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Because you are sons (NIV) <em>(BSB, ESV, NIV, NET, RSV, KJV, NASB, GW, NLT, NCV, JBP)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>that</u>. According to this interpretation, God gives us his Spirit, and that confirms that we are his children. So this verse should read, “<span data-bnType=\"implied\">That which shows</span> <u>that</u> we are his children is that God gave us the Spirit.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>To show that you are his children (GNT) <em>(GNT, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Most English versions follow this interpretation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to translate this clause is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Now that you are sons</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you:</strong> Paul used the pronoun <em>you</em> to address the Galatians directly. He then changed to the pronoun “our” in 4:6b to focus on the fact that all believers are sons and have the Spirit. In some languages, it may not be natural to change pronouns in this way. If that is true in your language, you may use the pronoun “we” here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And because <u>we</u> are his children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into <u>our</u> hearts (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>4:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>God sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>God sent the Spirit of his Son <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to live/stay</span> in our hearts,</p></li><li><p>God has sent the Spirit of his Son, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the Holy Spirit,</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to live</span> in us.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God sent:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB here translates as <em>sent</em> is the same Greek word as in 4:4b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God gave us</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Spirit of His Son:</strong> The phrase <em>the Spirit of His Son</em> refers to the Holy Spirit. In other passages, he is also called “the Spirit of God” and “the Spirit of Christ.” Your word for <em>the Spirit of His Son</em> must make it clear that this is the Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Spirit of his Son, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that is, the Holy Spirit</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Holy Spirit,</span> the Spirit that his Son <span data-bnType=\"implied\">promised</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See Spirit in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>into our hearts:</strong> The word that the BSB translates as <em>hearts</em> refers to the inner being of a person.

He enables us to call God “Father.” It does not refer to weeping.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It’s the Spirit <span data-bnType=\"implied\">living in us</span> who urgently calls out</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Spirit enables us to say</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>“Abba, Father!”:</strong> The word <em>Abba</em> is the Aramaic word that means <em>Father</em>. Jesus called God “Abba.” Jesus is God’s Son. Now we are God’s sons, so we too can call him “Abba.” Before Christ came, people did not address God as “Father.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate these words are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Transliterate the word “Abba” and use the word for “Father” in your language. This is what many English versions do. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Abba, Father <em>If you choose this option, you may want to include a footnote explaining that “Abba” means “Father” in Aramaic.</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Transliterate the word “Abba” and then explain that it means “Father.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“Abba,” which means Father.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use only one term. Either transliterate “Abba” or use your word for “Father.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Abba</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Father (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">If the word “Abba” is already a word in your language that means something else, you should not transliterate that word.</p>",

The contrast is between the negative way that the Galatians could have treated Paul and the positive way that they actually did treat him. Languages have different ways to indicate this negative-positive type of contrast. Some of the ways are:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>With the conjunction “but.”</p></li><li><p>With a conjunction other than “but.” This is a common way in English to show this type of contrast.

(CEV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God:</strong> The verb that the BSB translates as <em>welcomed</em> means “received.” In this clause Paul stated that the Galatians welcomed him with great honor and respect. He compared the welcome they gave him to the welcome they might give to a messenger from heaven.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You welcomed me as though I were one of God’s angels (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you took me in and cared for me as though I were an angel from God (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>angel of God:</strong> The word <em>angel</em> means “messenger.” It can be either a human messenger or a divine messenger. The phrase <em>of God</em> shows that here it refers to a divine messenger. It is a spirit being who serves God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate <em>angel of God</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>messenger of/from God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">holy/good</span> spirit-being from God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The word angel first occurs in 1:8a.

To state it in an active way, it is good when other people show an interest in the Galatians.

Paul was saying that it is fine if other people show an interest in the Galatians, but their motives must be good. The motives of the false teachers were not good.

Paul stated that his birth pains would continue until the Galatians were mature in Christ.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to the commentaries, there are at least two ways to interpret this clause: (1) It is a complete change of the metaphor in 4:19a. According to this interpretation, the Galatians are now pictured as the pregnant mother. Christ’s nature is forming in them. Paul would be in pain until Christ was fully developed in them. Those who follow this interpretation are: Schreiner, p. 289; George, p. 330; Longenecker, p. 195; and Burton, pp. 248–249. (2) It continues the metaphor in 4:19b. According to this interpretation, Paul continues to be pictured as the pregnant mother. He would continue to be in the agony of childbirth until the Galatians developed and became like Christ.

He begged them to change their thinking and their actions. He said that turning to the law put them back into the slavery that they were in before they knew Christ. He equated obeying the law with paganism. This is a startling and shocking comparison.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul appealed to the Galatians on the basis of the emotional bond between him and them. He reminded them of how that bond had developed and that it had resulted in their full acceptance of the true gospel. But now their turning away from the true gospel had perplexed him. He said that they were now like enemies because they followed the false teachers and had turned away from the true gospel.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">But the false teachers were the real enemies. For selfish reasons, they taught the Galatians to add something to their faith. They taught them to obey the law.

The other covenant was the <u>law</u> that God gave to Moses.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>these women represent/show two treaties/contracts</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Each of the two women stands for one of the agreements God made with his people.

Mount Sinai was where the law was given. Mount Sinai is in the land of Arabia. Arabia was where the descendants of Hagar’s son lived. They were descendants of the slave woman. So Paul associated the law with slavery.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Hagar also represents Jerusalem. Jerusalem is a figure of the Jewish religion. Paul said that the people who follow the Jewish religion are like Jerusalem’s children. They are slaves to the law.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">So Paul equated the law-keeping Jews with Hagar and her son. They were all slaves.

All those who believe in Christ as the means of justification are free and under the covenant of grace. They are not slaves.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>raise your voice and shout for joy</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>make your voice strong and declare your happiness</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>break into a shout of joy (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>raise your voice to make known your joy</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here the word <em>cry</em> does not mean “weep.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">As in 4:27b, if it would be considered too repetitive or poor style in your language to translate both expressions, you could combine the two expressions into one. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>shout with/for joy</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you who have never travailed:</strong> The word <em>travailed</em> refers to the pain that a woman has when she gives birth. This clause is another way to refer to a childless woman. If you have an idiom to say this in your language, you can use it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you who never felt the pains of childbirth (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you who have never suffered birth pains</p></blockquote><h4>4:27d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:27d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because the deserted/abandoned woman will have more children than the woman who has a husband.”</p></li><li><p>because the woman whose husband had left her will have many children. She will have more children than the woman who has a husband.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because:</strong> Verse 4:27d is the basis for the commands to rejoice in 4:27b–c. The Greek introduces this basis with a conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>because</em>. Another way to translate this word is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>desolate woman</em> means “deserted woman” or “forsaken woman.” It refers to a woman whose husband has left her. In Isaiah, the <em>desolate woman</em> refers to Jerusalem, which God abandoned. Isaiah prophesied that God would bring back the exiles. The new Jerusalem would be bigger than the old one, the one who had a husband.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul applied this verse to the heavenly Jerusalem. The heavenly Jerusalem will have more people than the earthly Jerusalem.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate these clauses are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the deserted woman will have many more children than the woman who has a husband</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>many are the children of the forsaken woman. They are more than those of the woman who has a husband</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>are:</strong> In Greek, there is no verb in 4:27d. So English versions add a verb. Some use the future “will be” or “will have.” Others use the present <em>are</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the woman who was deserted <u>will have</u> more children (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>more <u>are</u> the children of the desolate woman (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In this verse from Isaiah, the idea is that the woman had many children after her time of being desolate. So, in many languages, the future tense will be better.</p>",

The story from the Old Testament is about Abraham’s two sons Ishmael and Isaac. He called Ishmael “the son born according to the flesh.” Ishmael represents the false teachers. Ishmael persecuted Isaac, who was born “by the Spirit.” In the same way, the false teachers were persecuting the believers in Galatia.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to make parts of this verse explicit.

The contrast is between the way we would expect people to treat the children of promise and the way they actually treat them. The Greek indicates this contrast with a conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>however</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to introduce 4:29 is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Many English versions do not translate this conjunction.

He was the son of Hagar. Here Ishmael represents the false teachers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>by the flesh</em> refers to the fact that the child was conceived and born in the normal, human way. Abraham tried to fulfill God’s promise on his own. He did that by taking the slave woman Hagar and having a child with her. It is the same phrase that Paul used in 4:23a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The son who was born in the normal way (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he who was born in a human attempt to fulfill God’s promise</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the son of Hagar who was born because of the plan of people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the one who had only a natural birth</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See flesh, Meaning 5 in the Glossary for more information.</p><h4>4:29c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:29c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>persecuted the son born by the Spirit.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>caused suffering to the son who was born because of the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">work of God’s</span> Spirit.</p></li><li><p>was cruel to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Isaac,</span> the one who was born by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the help/power of</span> God’s Spirit.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>persecuted:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>persecuted</em> means “cause to suffer.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this verb are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>made trouble (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>treated…badly (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>caused to suffer</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>was cruel to</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This verb also occurs in 1:13b</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the son born by the Spirit:</strong> This clause refers to Isaac.

God’s Spirit allowed the elderly Sarah to become pregnant. Believers, who are also children of the promise, receive life through God’s Spirit.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>him who was born because of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the work of</span> the Spirit</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>him who was born by means <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the power/help</span> of God’s Spirit</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Isaac, the one who came by means of the Spirit fulfilling God’s promise</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Spirit:</strong> This phrase refers to the Spirit of God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Holy Spirit</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Spirit of God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See Spirit, Meaning 1 in the Glossary.</p><h4>4:29d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:29d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>It is the same now.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The same thing is happening today.

He contrasted two sons of Abraham: the son of the slave woman and the son of the free woman. The son of the slave woman represented slavery to the law. The son of the free woman represented the freedom of living in the grace of Christ. Living in slavery to the law is in conflict with living in the grace of Christ.

The two main interpretations are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It indicates the <u>purpose</u> for which Christ freed us. He freed us in order that we would have freedom from the law. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ has freed us so that we may enjoy the benefits of freedom. (GW) <em>(BSB, NIV, NJB, NASB, NET, RSV, ESV, REB, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It <u>emphasizes the verb</u> <em>set us free</em> in the sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So Christ has truly set us free. (NLT) <em>(GNT, CEV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). The majority of English versions and many commentaries follow this interpretation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Christ has set us free so that we might really be free <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from the law</span>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Christ has delivered/rescued us <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from the law</span> so that we would not be slaves <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to it</span>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We have freedom now, because Christ made us free.

They were to remain/continue in that freedom.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Therefore persevere <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in this freedom</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So stand strong (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Therefore be firm in this freedom (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So be strong</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So remain/continue <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in this freedom</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and do not be encumbered once more:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>be encumbered</em> means “be loaded down with” or “be burdened by.” Trying to obey religious laws is like being weighed down by a heavy load.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and do not let yourselves be burdened again (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and do not accept again</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and do not again surrender</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>once more:</strong> The phrase <em>once more</em> indicates that the Galatians had previously been slaves to religious laws when they worshiped idols. Obeying the law of Moses was no different than their former idol worship. Both made people slaves.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by a yoke of slavery:</strong> This is a figure of speech. A <em>yoke</em> is a piece of wood that is put over the necks of two oxen to join them together so that they work together. A <em>yoke</em> is also a piece of wood that one person wears around his neck to balance and carry two heavy loads. In this context, <em>yoke</em> refers to the type of yoke that a person wears. It was usually slaves who wore yokes. A yoke itself could be heavy, but it also represented the hard work of a slave. Obeying religious laws is like being a slave and wearing a yoke to carry a heavy load. They are similar in that both are miserable and undesirable.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this figure of speech are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>by a yoke such as slaves wear</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Modify the figure of speech. For example</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>into the slavery of the law (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">obeying religious laws again. This is like</span> being a slave</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not let laws tie you.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not think that you must follow certain religious laws <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be right with God</span></p></blockquote></li></ul>",

They continued to believe in Christ for justification. They had rejected circumcision as a means of justification. They would attain righteousness by means of faith in Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But:</strong> Verse 5:5 begins with a conjunction that is normally translated as “for.” Understood that way, it would introduce the reason why people who try to be justified by the law have fallen away from grace (5:4b). Some English versions translate it that way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, this conjunction can also be understood as introducing a contrast between “you” (who obey the law to be made right with God) and “we” (who believe in Christ to be made right with God). The BSB and some other English versions translate this conjunction as <em>But</em> in order to focus on the contrast.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to begin 5:5 are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But we</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>However, as for us</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>As for us (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by faith:</strong> There are three ways to interpret what the phrase <em>by faith</em> is connected to:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is connected to <u>righteousness:</u>. According to this interpretation, “righteousness by faith” is in contrast with “justified by the law” in 5:4a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But we…eagerly wait to receive everything promised to us who are right with God through faith. (NLT96) <em>(NLT96, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is connected with <u>eagerly wait for</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>faith causes us to wait eagerly (GW) <em>(BSB, NLT, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is connected with <u>the Spirit</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The power of God’s Spirit working through our faith (GNT) <em>(GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions translate <em>by faith</em> literally and it is not possible to tell which interpretation they follow. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>One scholar who follows this interpretation is Fung, who says, “The whole weight of the verse is on the two phrases ‘through the Spirit, by faith,’ (RSV) which are brought forward for emphasis since they stand for the two aspects that distinguish the Christian hope from the Jewish. There is in ‘through the Spirit’ an implied contrast with ‘the flesh’ which is the active principle of legal righteousness (cf. 3:3), while ‘by faith’ stands in explicit and decisive contrast with ‘by way of law’ (v. 4). The two phrases are not, strictly speaking, predicated of ‘righteousness’: it is not explicitly stated here that it is ‘through the Spirit’ and ‘by faith’ that believers are justified, but only that it is ‘through the Spirit, by faith’ that ‘we wait for the hope of righteousness.’ But since the expectation of this ‘hope’ to which believers are pointed forward by their justification is grounded in their present experience of the Spirit and in faith it is plainly not, and cannot be, based on works of the law, because justification, which gives rise to the hope in question, cannot itself be achieved by works of the law, but is attained only ‘by faith.’ The clear contrast between faith and law in the immediate context (as well as in the epistle as a whole) shows beyond doubt that in Paul’s thinking there can be no such thing as a hope which is being awaited on the basis of faith while the ground of that hope (namely, justification) is itself based on works of the law.We may therefore conclude that v. 5 unmistakably implies that justification is ‘by faith’ and not ‘by way of law,’ even though the full expression ‘justified by faith,’ which might have been expected, is lacking” (Fung, p. 227).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The final goal of a believer’s life is righteousness. It is by means of faith in Christ that believers attain this righteousness.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we are made right with God <u>by our faith</u></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we are righteous <u>because we believe/trust</u></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>faith:</strong> See faith, Meaning 1 in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we:</strong> The pronoun <em>we</em> refers to Paul and the other people who were not following the law in order to be made righteous. These are the people who had not fallen away from grace. You may need to make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">we who have not fallen away from grace</span> , we</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">we who reject circumcision for justification</span> , we</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The <em>we</em> is neither completely inclusive nor completely exclusive. It includes the majority of the Galatians, but it excludes those who have fallen from grace. If a choice has to be made, it is best to use the inclusive form, because Paul still considered the Galatians to be his brothers in Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>eagerly await:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>eagerly await</em> refers to waiting for and looking forward to the end of the age when Christ will return.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this verb are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>eagerly wait for the final day</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wait for that day with our whole heart</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>through the Spirit:</strong> There are at least two ways to interpret what the phrase <em>through the Spirit</em> is connected to:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is connected to the verb <u>eagerly await</u>. According to this interpretation, the Holy Spirit helps us and encourages us to eagerly wait for the final day when we will be made completely righteous. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>this is what we wait for by the power of God’s Spirit (GNT) <em>(BSB, GNT, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is connected to the word <u>hope</u>. According to this interpretation, the Holy Spirit causes us to hope or be sure that God will make us righteous. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Spirit makes us sure (CEV) <em>(CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions are literal and it is not possible to tell which interpretation they follow. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In 3:3, Paul said that believers begin their lives with the Spirit. They must continue to live their lives and wait for the day when the Lord returns. They can do this through the power of the Holy Spirit.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we, by the help of the Spirit, are eagerly waiting (TCNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>through <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the power of</span> the Holy Spirit</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>by the Spirit we wait eagerly for this hope (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Holy Spirit helps/encourages us to wait for</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the hope of righteousness:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB literally translates as <em>the hope of righteousness</em> refers to the righteousness that believers hope to receive on judgment day. The word <em>righteousness</em> refers to being “upright,” “blameless” or “just” before God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>hope</em> refers to something good that a person expects to happen. He is sure/certain that it will happen. In this context, believers expect to be declared righteous because God promised it. It is different from the modern use of the word “hope” in English.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the righteousness for which we hope</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the righteousness that we expect</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the righteousness God has promised to us (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we are eagerly waiting for God to declare us blameless. This is what we hope for/expect.</p></blockquote>",

People used this proverb to refer to a small amount of something having a large effect. Paul used this proverb to warn the Galatians about the false teaching.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>leaven</em> refers to a product like yeast that makes bread rise. It only takes a small amount of yeast to make a large amount of bread dough rise. In the Bible, leaven is almost always a symbol of evil. So here it means that just as leaven affects bread, a small amount of false teaching will affect the churches throughout Galatia and do great harm to them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this proverb are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Make it explicit that it is a proverb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“It takes only a little yeast to make the whole batch of dough rise,” as they say. (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Make it explicit that it is a warning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Be careful! “Just a little yeast makes the whole batch of dough rise.” (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Make it explicit that the proverb refers to the false teaching. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This false teaching is like a little yeast that spreads through the whole batch of dough!

As the proverb warns, “Even a little bit of leaven affects the whole lump of dough.”</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Watch out. Remember the proverb that says: “A little yeast makes a lot of flour rise.” And this false teaching is like yeast.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>leaven:</strong> The Greek noun that the BSB translates as <em>leaven</em> refers to a product that makes bread dough rise. The most common type of leaven is yeast. Most of the more modern English versions translate this word as “yeast.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This word also occurs in Matthew 13:33, Mark 8:15, and Luke 13:21. If you have translated any of these passages, you should use the same word here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you have not yet translated the word &quot;leaven&quot; or “yeast&quot;, here are some ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use an expression that describes the yeast. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>what spreads to make bread rise</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>bread-expanding substance</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a term from the national language and indicate its meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>yisti that spreads to make bread swell</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Borrow a word and explain it in a footnote. Here is an example of a possible footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Yeast is something that spreads in flour dough and causes it to rise so that after the dough is baked it is soft to eat.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>works through the whole batch of dough:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>works through</em> is more literally “leavens.” The word “leavens” is the verb form of the noun “leaven.” This verb refers to the process whereby leaven/yeast makes bread rise.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>batch of dough</em> refers to an amount of clay or dough.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to make the whole batch of dough rise (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>spreads through the whole batch of dough (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>makes a lot of flour rise/swell</p></blockquote>",

In 1:7b and 5:12, Paul spoke of people (plural) who were troubling the Galatians. These people were the false teachers. Because of these two previous verses, there are several ways to interpret to whom the phrase <em>The one who is troubling</em> refers:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to <u>any one</u> of the false teachers. According to this interpretation, Paul was saying that if anyone among the false teachers troubles you, he will be punished. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>anyone who makes trouble with you (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whoever troubles you</p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to <u>one particular individual</u>. According to this interpretation, Paul was referring to the leader of the false teachers. So this phrase should be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the/that person who is troubling you</p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to the <u>group</u> of false teachers. According to this interpretation, Paul was referring to all the false teachers together as one group. So it should be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the group who are troubling you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the people who are troubling you</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>One scholar who follows this interpretation is Baker, who says, “The probable meaning is: ‘There are several disturbers. Be on your guard, therefore, so that if one— anyone at all—of these creators of confusion approaches, you resist him, bearing in mind that, whoever he may be, he will have to pay the penalty’” (p. 203). This interpretation is also followed by Burton, p. 285.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the one who is confusing you (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>whoever upsets/disturbs you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word that the BSB here translates as <em>troubling</em> also occurs in 1:7b.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will bear the judgment:</strong> Paul reminded the Galatians that God will judge those who lead believers astray.

According to this interpretation, this clause clarifies the phrase “the one who” in the first part of 5:10c. It can even be combined with it.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>were called <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be God’s people, and he wants you</span> to be free</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, the word <em>called</em> is only used when someone calls another person to come to a physical location.

Their freedom did not permit them to live sinful lives. Instead, they should lovingly serve each other.</p></div><h4>5:15a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:15a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But if you keep on biting and devouring one another,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But if you<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">act like wild animals/dogs who</span> bite and devour/eat each other,</p></li><li><p>If you go on hurting each other and tearing each other apart (NCV)</p></li><li><p>But when you<sup>(plur)</sup> criticize and fight each other,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But:</strong> There is a contrast between 5:14b and 5:15. The contrast is between the command to love one another and the way that the Galatians were actually treating one another. The BSB indicates this contrast with the conjunction <em>But</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if you keep on biting and devouring one another:</strong> This clause is a metaphor. In this metaphor, the way that the Galatians were treating one another is compared to the kinds of actions that wild animals do. Paul implied that the actions of the sinful nature are as destructive as the actions of wild animals.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul used two words, <em>biting</em> and <em>devouring</em> (that is, eating), to emphasize how serious the situation in Galatia was.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this metaphor are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the metaphor but make the image explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">are wild animals that</span> bite and devour/eat one another</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Change the metaphor to a simile and make the image explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">act like wild animals that</span> bite and eat each other</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if you act like wild animals, hurting and harming each other (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without using a figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if you criticize and attack each other (GW)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>devouring:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>devouring</em> is a word used for wild animals eating food. They eat greedily and swallow food without chewing it. This is not the normal word used to describe humans eating.</p><h4>5:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>watch out, or you will be consumed by one another.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>watch out, or you will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">completely</span> destroy one another.</p></li><li><p>be careful, or you will completely destroy each other.

Paul asked the Galatians to stop and think about the effects of not loving one another.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>watch out or you will be destroyed by each other (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>look out!

The flesh and the Spirit are opposed to each other, and as a result, you cannot do the things you want.

(GW) <em>(BSB, NIV, NJB, NET, REB, GW, NLT, KJV, NCV, JBP)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Many English versions are like the BSB, which translates 5:17d as “<u>so that</u> you do not do what you want.” This translation may appear to indicate purpose, but the verb is indicative, not subjunctive. Commentators tell us that this construction indicates result, i.e. “so that (as a result) you do not do what you want.”</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>This clause expresses <u>purpose</u>.

According to this interpretation, someone has yielded to a desire to do something wrong. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if another believer is overcome by some sin (NLT) <em>(RSV, NLT, CEV, GW, NCV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means that <u>someone has caught or discovered another person in the act of sinning</u>.

In some languages, it will not be necessary to translate this conjunction either.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>each one should carry his own load:</strong> This clause is a metaphor. In this metaphor, the work/responsibilities that God has given each believer are compared to bearing/carrying a load. Believers must concentrate on doing the work for which they themselves are responsible.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this clause are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the metaphor.

In such a situation, there may be an apparent conflict between 6:2 and 6:5. On the one hand, we are to bear one another’s burdens/loads. On the other hand, we are to bear our own loads.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The words translated as “burden” and <em>load</em> are different in Greek. So you may have to say something like “heavy load” in 6:2 to distinguish it from <em>load</em> here.</p>",

This is the exact opposite of what Paul said about himself in 5:11. The false teachers were preaching circumcision to avoid persecution. If Paul had preached circumcision, he could have avoided persecution as well, but since he refused to do so, he was persecuted.

The verb “persecuted” means “causing people to suffer” because of their religious beliefs. The false teachers were afraid that the Jews would persecute them if they did not force believers to be circumcised. The false teachers were more concerned about avoiding persecution than about preaching the truth of the gospel.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The verb “persecuted” is passive. Some ways to translate this clause are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They don’t want to be persecuted (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They are afraid they will be attacked (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active verb.

It refers to the complete gospel message of salvation by faith in Christ instead of by obeying the law.

So many versions do not translate it. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Not even those who are circumcised obey the law (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it will not be necessary to translate this conjunction either.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the circumcised do not even keep the law themselves:</strong> The clause <em>the circumcised</em> refers to the false teachers. They are the same people to whom Paul referred in 6:12a as “those who want to make a good impression outwardly.” They forced the Galatians to keep one part of the law: circumcision. But they did not bother to try to keep other parts of the law. They themselves did not keep the whole law. They were hypocrites.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They are circumcised, but they don’t obey the Law of Moses.

The contrast is between the fact that the false teachers did not obey the law themselves (6:13a), and the fact that they wanted to force the Galatians believers to obey the law by being circumcised (6:13b). The Greek indicates this contrast with a conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>yet</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they want you to be circumcised:</strong> Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they desire to have you circumcised (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they want you to get circumcised</p></blockquote><h4>6:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that they may boast in your flesh.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that they may boast about <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what was done to</span> your flesh/body.</p></li><li><p>so that they may boast about having/getting you circumcised.</p></li><li><p>in order that they may brag <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to others</span> because of what they forced you to do.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that they may boast:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>that</em> indicates that 6:13c is the purpose of 6:13b.

Paul explained that being dead to the world means that the things of the world, such as circumcision, are no longer important.

In some languages, it may not be necessary to translate this conjunction either.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything:</strong> In Greek, this clause is more literally “neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision.” The BSB adds the word <em>means</em> to make the meaning clearer.

All this comes from God for those who are in a relationship with him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Few languages will have a word for “peace” that is as broad as the Jewish concept. Some languages will have a word to describe the absence of war or conflict and a different word to describe a general state of well-being. If possible, choose your word that has the broadest range of meaning. (If you must make a choice, a word that describes a state of well-being is preferable in this context.)</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>well-being</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>good situation</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>harmony</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The word for <em>Peace</em> first occurs in 1:3.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>mercy:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>mercy</em> refers to God showing kindness, compassion, or pity on people because they suffer or are needy. Mercy has a similar meaning to the word “grace.” But “grace” focuses more on the goodness of God towards people even when they do not deserve it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>pity</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>compassion</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This is the only time in Galatians that the word “mercy” occurs.</p><h4>6:16b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:16b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who walk by this rule,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>those who live according to this principle,</p></li><li><p>all who follow/obey this teaching,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">That is what I pray for</span> all people who walk according to this rule.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who walk by this rule:</strong> This clause refers to “everyone who follows this rule/principle.” This is the rule/principle that is in 6:15: what is important is the new creation, not circumcision.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here the word <em>rule</em> does not refer to a rule or commandment in the law of Moses.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>As for those who follow this rule in their lives (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all those who live by this principle (NLT96)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Everyone who follows what I just said</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>All who walk according to this teaching</p></blockquote><h4>6:16c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:16c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>even to the Israel of God.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>even upon the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">true</span> Israel of God.</p></li><li><p>They are God’s <span data-bnType=\"implied\">true</span> Israel/people.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>even to the Israel of God:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>even</em>.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>even</u> or <u>that is</u>.

In this section he again contrasted circumcision and true faith. Those who teach that believers must be circumcised have a false basis for boasting. The only true basis for boasting is Christ’s death on the cross. Through the cross, believers are new creations in Christ. That is what matters. The Galatians should follow these truths. They must not follow false teachers who want to add circumcision to faith.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul ended his letter with a blessing/prayer.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other possible headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Final Warning and Benediction (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s Final Advice (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul Summarizes His Teachings About Circumcision (GW)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1049006018\" data-endVerseId=\"1049006018\"><h3>Paragraph 6:18</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Verse 6:18 is Paul’s final prayer for the Galatians.
