Use an order that is natural in your language.</p></div><h4>1:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>On many past occasions and in many different ways,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ In past ages, at many <span data-bnType=\"implied\">different</span> times and in many different ways,</p></li><li><p>¶ Long ago, on many <span data-bnType=\"implied\">different</span> occasions and in various ways,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>On many past occasions:</strong> The phrase <em>On many past occasions</em> refers to past times that have already ended. It refers to the past in contrast to the present. In this context it refers to the times when God spoke to people through prophets. This time period ended several hundred years before the author of Hebrews wrote. Refer to it in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in many different ways:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The letter to the Hebrews begins with two words which sound like each other, and which are linked by <em>kai</em> ‘and.’ They are <em>polumerōs</em> and <em>polutrōps</em>. Both words start with <em>polu-</em> which means “many,” and they make a striking beginning to this book.</span></span> The phrase <em>in many different ways</em> indicates that God gave different kinds of messages, including laws, promises, instructions, and prophecies. He communicated these messages in different ways, for example, by dreams, visions, direct messages, signs, and symbols, and events. The prophets who communicated the messages lived at different times in the past.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate the phrase “On many past occasions and in many different ways” are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>using various ways on many different occasions</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>at many different times and in many different ways (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>1:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>God spoke to our fathers through the prophets.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>God spoke to our<sup>(incl)</sup> ancestors through the prophets.</p></li><li><p>God spoke to our<sup>(incl)</sup> forefathers through the prophets,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God spoke to our fathers through the prophets:</strong> The phrase <em>spoke…through the prophets</em> indicates that God told the prophets what he wanted them to tell the other people. Then the prophets told the people those messages from God. Some other ways to translate this meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God spoke to our ancestors by means of the prophets</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God sent prophets to speak <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his messages</span> to our forefathers</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to our fathers:</strong> The phrase <em>to our fathers</em> refers to the ancestors of the author and readers of Hebrews. It refers in general to the people of Israel in the Old Testament, who were descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>prophets:</strong> The <em>prophets</em> were men who spoke messages from God. They told others what God revealed to them. Some ways to translate <em>prophets</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>spokesmen for God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>men who spoke his/God’s words</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his message-speakers</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It is good to use a general term that does not focus only on foretelling the future. Prophets did foretell the future, but they also gave people other messages from God. They spoke about their own times, and they told people to stop sinning and to obey God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">When choosing a term for <em>prophets</em>, consider how you will distinguish <em>prophets</em> from other words which are similar in meaning such as “angels,” “apostles,” and “preachers.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">See also <u>prophet meaning 1A</u> in KBT.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:1a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">It may be helpful in your language to reorder the phrases in 1:1.

However, it is also parallel to 1:1. After speaking through the prophets, he spoke through his own Son. The GW translates the contrast and the parallelism without using a conjunction:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1</sup>In the past God spoke to our ancestors…through the prophets. <sup>2</sup>In these last days he has spoken to us through his Son. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate the connection between the verses in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in these last days:</strong> The phrase <em>in these last days</em> refers to the period of time before the world ends. The word <em>these</em> indicates that the last days had already begun when the author wrote Hebrews. Many scholars believe that these days began with the death and resurrection of Christ and continue until his return.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate <em>in these last days</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>at the end of this present age (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in the final days of this era/time</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>He has spoken to us by His Son:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The phrases “through the prophets” and <em>by His Son</em> both begin with the Greek word <em>en</em> ‘in’ where we might expect the more usual <em>dia</em> ‘through, by means of.’ But <em>en</em> can also have the meaning of ‘through, by means of.’ God did indeed speak <u>through</u> the prophets, but he also spoke “in the person of the prophets.” They were indeed the messengers, but they themselves and the lives they lived were also <u>part of the message</u> to people. In the same way, God’s Son was himself the message about God, as well as being the messenger.</span></span> The clause <em>He has spoken to us by His Son</em> is similar to the phrase “by the prophets” in 1:1. It indicates that God used his Son to speak to us. God’s Son spoke God’s words to people, and he also <u>is</u> God’s Word. He communicates to people what God wants them to know.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he has spoken to us through his Son (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God sent his Son to speak his messages</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>us:</strong> The pronoun <em>us</em> refers to both the author and readers of Hebrews.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>His Son:</strong> In the Greek text the phrase <em>His Son</em> is simply <em>Son</em>. It refers to God’s Son, Jesus. In other passages, the full title “the Son of God” is used (see 4:14 and 6:6, for example). This title was often used to refer to a savior who would be a descendant of King David. God would send this savior to rescue his people. This person was often referred to as the “Messiah” or “Christ.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The title “the Son of God” also indicates that Jesus has the same nature and character as God. The relationship between God the Father and Jesus, his Son, is similar in some way to the relationship between human fathers and sons. God the Father does not have a physical body. He did not have a sexual relationship with Mary that resulted in her becoming pregnant and giving birth to Jesus. The Son of God existed eternally as the Son with his Father.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In areas where people do not understand the title “the Son of God” in this way, you may want to include a footnote that explains the correct meaning. Here is a suggested footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This title refers to Jesus. It indicates that Jesus has the same nature and character as God. It does not mean that God the Father had a sexual relationship with Mary that resulted in her becoming pregnant and giving birth to Jesus. Mary became pregnant with Jesus in a miraculous way by the Holy Spirit of God.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is natural to speak of a son as a “child,” without specifying male or female. If that is true in your language, you may use a more general term, such as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Child of God<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A translation of the title “the Son of God” must include a familial term such as “son” or “child.” Translations such as “the man who is God,” “the divine man,” or “the God man” are not acceptable, since they do not retain familial language. Examples of acceptable translation options include “the Son who comes from God,” and “the divine/unique/eternal Son of God.”</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Other verses will usually make clear that Jesus was a male child. If you use a phrase such as “the male child of God,” be sure that it does not imply that God had another child who was female.</p><h4>1:2b–3e</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 1:2b–3e the author tells seven facts about the greatness of God’s Son.</p><h4>1:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>whom He appointed heir of all things,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>God chose his son to be the heir of all things,</p></li><li><p>God declared that his son will someday possess/rule everything.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">This part of the verse tells the first fact that the author said about the greatness of God’s Son in 1:2b–3e.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>whom He appointed heir of all things:</strong> When God appointed his Son as the <em>heir</em>, he declared that his Son owns everything, just as God himself does. God decided that his Son will own all things.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages the word <em>heir</em> may wrongly imply that God will die and his Son will inherit his things. If that is true in your language, you should translate the meaning in a different way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God has chosen his Son to own all things (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God made his Son responsible for everything. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>heir:</strong> In this context the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>heir</em> means “someone who receives something as his own possession.” It does not imply here that he receives it as a result of someone’s death. See the preceding note for translation examples.</p><h4>1:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and through whom He made the universe.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and it was through him that he created the universe.</p></li><li><p>He was the one whom God caused/used to make the universe.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">This part of the verse is similar to John 1:3 and Colossians 1:16. It is the second fact that the author said about the greatness of God’s Son in 1:2b–3e.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>through whom He made the universe:</strong> The phrase <em>through whom He made the universe</em> indicates that God created everything by means of his Son. God caused his Son to create everything. Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It was through his Son that God made the universe.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God created the universe by means of his Son.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God caused his Son to be the one to create the universe.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the universe:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>universe</em> is plural, and it refers to the whole creation. It includes not just the world itself, but everything that God created. It includes the earth, the sea, the sun, the moon, and the stars. In some languages, you may need to use a phrase to express this meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the earth and the sky</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the whole world</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:2b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to reorder 1:2b–c. You may need to say that God made everything through his Son, before you say that God made him heir of everything. Several English versions follow this order. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2c</sup>He is the one through whom God created the universe, <sup>2b</sup>the one whom God has chosen to possess all things at the end. (GNT)</p></blockquote></div>",

It indicates that the Son received the place of greatest honor and authority with God. The phrase <em>the Majesty on high</em> refers to God, the King over everything. Sitting at God’s right hand symbolizes that God’s Son shares God’s authority. In this context, God gave his Son authority to rule with him after the Son atoned for people’s sins.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are several ways to translate this clause:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use the figurative language in your translation.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God gave him the place of greatest honor/authority with him in heaven</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Majesty:</strong> The phrase <em>the Majesty</em> refers here to God himself, not just to his majesty and greatness.

In the past God spoke to his people through his prophets. Now during this later time, he has spoken to his people through his own Son. God’s Son shows people who God is.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In 1:1–2a the author used parallelism to show a contrast between how God spoke in the past and how he speaks now. In the past God spoke through the prophets, but now God speaks to us through his Son. In your translation, it is important to emphasize this contrast, especially the fact that God now speaks to us by the Son.</p><table style=\"min-width: 50px\"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>1:1</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>1:2</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>in the past</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>in these last days</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>to our fathers</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>to us</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>through the prophets</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>by His Son</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek, the four verses in 1:1–4 are one long sentence that describes who the Son is and what he has done. It is common in Greek to have long sentences like this. Most English versions divide this section into several sentences. You may do what is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In 1:2b–3e there are seven important facts about God’s Son:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>God appointed his Son to be heir of all things (an important theme in 1:5–6).</p></li><li><p>God created everything through his Son (an important theme in 1:7–14).</p></li><li><p>The Son reflects God’s glory (an important theme in 2:5–8).</p></li><li><p>The Son shows us exactly what God is like.</p></li><li><p>The Son keeps everything working by his powerful word.</p></li><li><p>The Son made a way to make people clean from their sin (an important theme in 2:10–17, 5:1–10, 7:1–28, and 9:1–10:18).</p></li><li><p>The Son sat down on the right side of God (see 1:13 and 8:1–2).</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">It is good to translate the section before you decide on a heading for it. Some other possible headings are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God has revealed himself to us through his Son.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The greatness of the Son of God</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1059001001\" data-endVerseId=\"1059001004\"><h3>Paragraph 1:1–4</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">There are several ways to arrange the phrases in 1:1–4. The BSB mostly follows the order of phrases in the Greek text. The NIV uses a different order. Compare the order of the phrases in the BSB and NIV below:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1</sup>On many past occasions and in many different ways, God spoke to our fathers through the prophets. <sup>2</sup>But in these last days He has spoken to us by His Son… (BSB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1</sup>In the past God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways, <sup>2</sup>but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son… (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The NIV puts the phrase “at many times and in various ways” at the end of 1:1 instead of at the beginning, as in the BSB. Use an order that is natural in your language.</p></div><h4>1:4</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek 1:4 is part of the long sentence that began at 1:1. It concludes paragraph 1:1–4 with a statement about the Son’s greatness. This statement is also the theme of 1:5–14, so the GNT and GW begin a new section at 1:4. However, in most English versions 1:4 is the final statement of paragraph 1:1–4. The author of Hebrews often uses statements like this that conclude one section but also introduce the next one.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to change the order of clauses in this verse. See the General Comment on 1:4a–b at the end of 1:4b for suggestions.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So:</strong> In Greek 1:4 continues the sentence that began in 1:1. Some English versions supply a conjunction like <em>So</em> to indicate that 1:4 is a result of 1:2b–3. Some other ways to show this connection are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Thus (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This shows that (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He became as far superior to the angels as the name He has inherited is excellent beyond theirs:</strong> This statement is a comparison. It indicates that God’s Son is much greater than the angels. The name that God gave to his Son after his Son made purification for sins (1:3d) is also much greater than the angels’ name. Some other ways to translate this meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This shows that the Son is far greater than the angels, just as the name God gave him is far greater than their names. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He received a seat/position that is higher than the seat/position of all the angels, for the name he received from God was more honored than the name given to angels.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is true that the angels are great and their names are honorable. But God’s Son surpasses them in greatness, and the name that God has given him also surpasses their name.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate the comparison in a natural way in your language.</p><h4>1:4a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:4a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So He became as far superior to the angels</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>In this way he became much greater than the angels,</p></li><li><p>This shows that God has given him much greater honor/glory than the angels have.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He became…superior to the angels:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>He became…superior</em> means “became greater than.” The Son had greater honor and authority than the angels before he came to earth. Then he became “a little lower than the angels” to die for our sins (2:9). When he finished providing that purification (1:3d), he sat down at God’s right hand (1:3e). At that time, he again became superior to the angels and received even more honor and authority than he had before.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to translate <em>He became…superior to the angels</em> is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>has been given praiseworthiness/glory which is better than the glory of the angels<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Tagbanwa back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>angels:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>angels</em> means “messengers.” It refers here to spirit beings who serve God. Sometimes God sends an angel to tell a message to human beings. He also sends angels to serve him in other ways. Some ways to translate this term are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a descriptive word or phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>messengers <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from God/heaven</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">good/holy</span> spirit-beings</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a local term that fits the biblical meaning.</p></li><li><p>In some areas the churches may already be using a borrowed term or a transliterated word for “angel.” Be sure that this term fits the biblical meaning. If some people do not understand the right meaning from this term, you may need to indicate the meaning in some way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><em>angelos</em> messengers <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from God</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>sacred <em>angelos</em> spirits</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Be sure that your term for “angel” is different from your terms for “prophet” and “apostle.” See <u>angel Meaning 1</u> in KBT for more information. If you translated this word in other books, check to see how you translated it there.</p><h4>1:4b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:4b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>as the name He has inherited is excellent beyond theirs.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and he inherited/received a much greater name than they have.</p></li><li><p>In the same way the title <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Son</span> which <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> gave him is more honorable/glorious than their title.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as the name He has inherited is excellent beyond theirs:</strong> This clause is the second part of the comparison in 1:4a. Just as the Son himself is greater than the angels, he also inherited a <em>name</em> (title) that is greater than their name (title). In this context the verb <em>inherited</em> implies that he received the name from God. In some languages it is necessary to make that explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and God gave him a name that is much greater than theirs (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the name He has inherited:</strong> The word <em>inherited</em> is a verb form of the noun that the BSB translated as “heir” in 1:2b. The verb is used in a similar way here to mean “gained” or “received.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDAG, page 547, lists “acquire, obtain, come into possession of” as the second meaning of this word.</span></span> God’s Son gained this name because God gave it to him. The verb does not imply here that the Son received the name when someone died. Some ways to translate <em>He has inherited</em> in this context are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he has been given a name (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the name God gave him (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the name that he received from God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate the meaning in a similar way as you translated “heir” in 1:2. In some languages it may be necessary to specify the name that the Son received. If that is true in your language, you may supply “Son” as the quotations in 1:5 indicate.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Montefiore (page 39) says, “The name which Jesus has by right must be the name of the Son, as the succeeding verses establish.” Lane (page 17) says, “In verse 4 the superior name is almost certainly the acclamation ‘my son’ of Psalm 2:7 quoted in verse 5….” Ellingworth (page 105) states, “The immediate context suggests that the ‘name’ is that of Son….” An Exegetical Summary of Hebrews (page 31) lists thirteen commentaries that follow this view.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he has been given the name Son of God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the name:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>name</em> refers to the authority and role that the Son has. It does not refer here to a name that people called him, such as “Jesus” or “Emmanuel.” It may refer either to his role as God’s Son or to his role in general. Some other ways to translate <em>name</em> in this context are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>authority</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>position/status</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>title</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>excellent beyond:</strong> In this context the phrase <em>excellent beyond</em> has almost the same meaning as “superior to” earlier in this verse. It continues the comparison between God’s Son and the angels. As he is much greater than they are, his name is also much greater. You should use an appropriate way in your language to describe an excellent role or rank.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be helpful to use the same word for the comparison in both places. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Son was made <u>greater</u> than the angels, just as the name that God gave him is <u>greater</u> than theirs. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>theirs:</strong> The pronoun <em>theirs</em> is a short way to refer to “their name,” which the author compares to the Son’s “name.” The word “name” is implied. It refers to the angels’ rank and authority. In some languages it is necessary to translate “name” explicitly here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>their name</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>their authority/title</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:4a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek text, 1:4 is a long sentence that compares the Son and his name to the angels and their name. In some languages it is more natural to make a comparison by making two separate statements that contrast with each other. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The angels are not great; the Son is great. Likewise, the name that God gave the angels is not great; the name he gave his Son is great.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In this division the author gave evidence to prove that Jesus is greater than the angels.

Another way to introduce the explanation is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This is evident/clear because</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The explanation in 1:5 comes from Scripture.

It emphasizes the fact that God never said to any of the angels what he said to his Son in 1:5b–c. It also implies a contrast. God did say those words to his Son. That proves that his Son is greater than any angel. Some ways to translate this are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Did God ever say to any angel…?</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a rhetorical question and supply the answer.

These psalms were fulfilled when Christ came to earth many years after they were written.</span></span> to Christ, the Messiah, as God’s Son. In this quotation God declared that Christ is his Son, and God will honor him as his Son.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">When God said this, Christ was already fully mature, so the quotation does not refer to the time of his birth. It refers to the time when God gave him glory as his Son. Some other ways to translate this quotation are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You are my Son. And now it will be known that I am your Father.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You are my Child. Today I will show that I am your Father.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>You are My Son:</strong> For information on how to translate this reference to Jesus as the <em>Son</em> of God, see the note on “His son” in 1:2a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>today I have become Your Father:</strong> In this context the statement <em>today I have become Your Father</em> implies that God is giving Christ the honor and authority that he deserves as God’s Son. In biblical culture fathers often gave their adult sons great authority and honor. God gave Christ his own authority and glory after Christ accomplished the purification for our sins (1:3).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate <em>today I have become Your Father</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Today I have fathered you. (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>On this day I give you the honor/authority that you deserve as my Son.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I declare/reveal today that you are my Son.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some cultures the relationship between fathers and sons is different from that relationship in biblical culture. If that is true in your language, you may need to include a footnote to explain what the term implies here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In that culture fathers gave their sons great authority. A father expected people to honor his son. If they did not honor the son, it was also an insult to the father.</p></blockquote><h4>1:5d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:5d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Or again: “I will be His Father, and He will be My Son”?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And in another place <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Scripture</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God said</span>, “I will be his Father, and he will be my Son.”</p></li><li><p>God also said, “<span data-bnType=\"implied\">I will say/declare</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to people</span> that I am his Father, and that he is my Son.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Or again:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>Or again</em> is literally “and again.” It indicates that the author will quote another statement from the OT to support what he said in 1:4b. The statement will show again that God’s Son is superior to the angels. Introduce this next quotation in a natural way in your language. Some other ways to introduce it are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And in another place in the Scriptures <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God said</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God proved this again when he said</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that in 1:5b–c God spoke directly to the Son, so the text uses the words “you” and “your.” Here in 1:5d God spoke to other people about the Son, using words like “he” and “his.” In some languages it may be necessary to make explicit that here God spoke to people about his Son. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In another Scripture, God told <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span>, “I will be his Father…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will be His Father, and He will be My Son:</strong> This second OT quotation is from 2 Samuel 7:14. Here the author used it to emphasize the relationship between God and Christ. It indicates that God will show people that Christ is his Son. That implies that he has the same nature as God, and God honors Christ as his Son.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will declare that I am his Father; yes, he is my Son.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will show <span data-bnType=\"implied\">everyone</span> that I am his father and he is my son.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will be a Father to him, and he will be a Son to me.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His Father:</strong> When the Bible refers to God as the <em>Father</em> of Christ, it indicates that the relationship between him and Christ is similar in some ways to the relationship between human fathers and sons. It does not indicate that God procreated Christ. See the note on “you are my Son” earlier in 1:5b–c.</p>",

In some languages a conjunction may not be needed.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>again:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the word <em>again</em> in this context:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It introduces another OT quote to prove that Christ is greater than the angels. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says: (ESV) <em>(BSB, ESV, NIV, RSV, NRSV, NLT, NCV, GW, GNT, JBP, REB, CEV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to the second coming of Christ into the world. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But when he again brings his firstborn into the world, he says: (NET) <em>(NET, NASB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Most commentaries and versions favor this interpretation. Some versions do not translate the word <em>again</em>, but still imply that the OT quote refers to the Son’s first coming into the world.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>when God brings His firstborn into the world:</strong> This statement refers to the time when God brought his Son to the earth.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Scholars suggest several different specific times that this clause may refer to. It may refer either to the actual time of Jesus’ birth, or more generally to his time on earth as a man, or to his enthronement in heaven after his atoning death and his resurrection.</span></span> Some other ways to translate the statement are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when God sent his firstborn Son to this earth</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when God caused his firstborn to come to the world</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>firstborn:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>firstborn</em> is used figuratively. In Jewish culture the firstborn son in a family was an important person. He was the heir of his father, and his father often gave him authority to represent him in important matters. See the discussion on “heir of all things” in 1:2b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>firstborn</em> is a title that emphasizes Christ’s status and importance. In some cultures the term <em>firstborn</em> does not express that meaning. If that is true in your culture, you may need to express the meaning in a different way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>honored Son</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his Son who has no equal</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be helpful to make the term for <em>firstborn</em> into a different statement.

Therefore when God sent….<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Christ is also called the <em>firstborn</em> in Colossians 1:15, 1:18; Romans 8:29; Revelation 1:5.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>into the world:</strong> The word <em>world</em> refers to the whole inhabited earth. Some ways to translate <em>into the world</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the people</span> on earth</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">here</span> to this world</p></blockquote><h4>1:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He says: “Let all God’s angels worship Him.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>he said, “All my/God’s angels must worship him.”</p></li><li><p>he declared/said that all his angels must worship his Son.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He says: “Let all God’s angels worship Him.”:</strong> The words <em>Let all God’s angels worship Him</em> are quoted from the Greek translation of Deuteronomy 32:43.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is a textual issue concerning Deuteronomy 32:43. Until the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, it was thought that the author of Hebrews was following the Greek translation of the Old Testament (the LXX) here. However, a Hebrew manuscript from the Dead Sea Scrolls also has this clause. Lane (WBC, page 28) suggests that it may be quoted from a translation provided in the Odes (songs) that were included in the Greek Psalter used in the early church.</span></span> In this context it is a command. God commands that his angels must worship his Son.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may not be natural to use the word <em>God’s</em> when God himself is speaking. You may need to use another way to refer to him. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>All of my angels must worship that Child of mine.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he commands all of his angels to worship him (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>He says:</strong> The phrase <em>He says</em> introduces what God said when he brought his Son into the world. At the time that the author of Hebrews wrote this, God had already said it. Use a natural verb form in your language to introduce what God said here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>angels:</strong> The word <em>angels</em> refers to spirit beings that serve God. It first occurs in this book in 1:4. Check to see how you have translated it there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>worship:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>worship</em> means to express devotion, honor, and reverence for God or for other gods. Some ways to express this worship are by praying, bowing down, or kneeling to show submission, serving God obediently, and praising him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In this context<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>It was used in the Gospels, for example, when Satan tempted Jesus (Luke 4:7–8) and also when people came and knelt before Jesus, as in Matthew 8:2 and Mark 5:6.</span></span> the word <em>worship</em> indicates that the angels must agree that the Son is God, and they must give him honor. It probably also indicates that they must bow down or prostrate themselves before the Son to show their reverence.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate <em>worship</em> in this context are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>adore</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>bow down to</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>serve/revere</p></blockquote>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>About the angels, he says…but about the Son he says…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Translate this contrast in a natural way in your language.</p></div><h4>1:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Now about the angels He says:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ And when God was speaking of his angels, he said</p></li><li><p>¶ About the angels God said <span data-bnType=\"implied\">this</span>:</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Now:</strong> This word introduces another contrast between the angels and the Son. It is not a time word. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Also,</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages can allow the context to indicate the introduction and do not need to translate this word.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>about the angels He says:</strong> Here the author introduces the fourth quotation that he has given from the OT. It is taken from Psalm 104:4, where God speaks about his angels. Some other ways to introduce this quotation are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God said about the angels (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And when God speaks about the angels, he says (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>angels:</strong> The word <em>angels</em> means spirit beings who serve God. The word <em>angels</em> first occurs in Hebrews in 1:4. For more information, see the note there.</p><h4>1:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“He makes His angels winds, His servants flames of fire.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>that he makes the angels who serve him into winds and fire.</p></li><li><p>“I change my angels into wind and my servants into flaming fire.” (CEV)</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">This part of the verse is a quotation from Psalm 104:4. It has two parallel statements about God and the angels:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He makes <u>his angels</u> <strong>winds</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">and he makes</span> <u>his servants</u> <strong>flames of fire</strong></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice that in the second line the words “and he makes” are implied. For examples of how these two statements can be combined into one statement, see the General Comment on 1:7b at the end of 1:7b.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He makes His angels winds, His servants flames of fire:</strong> This statement is part of a contrast that the author makes between the angels and the Son. It shows that the angels are part of God’s creation, as wind and fire are. Angels obey God completely, and he can change them in any way he wants to. He can make them like winds or fire. This statement may refer to the time when God gave his law to people on Mt. Sinai.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Cockerill 1979:109 says, “When God spoke on Sinai he was accompanied by angels and surrounded by winds and fire (Exodus 19:16–18; Deuteronomy 5:22–26). As awesome as those manifestations were, they betokened the temporality of the angels in comparison to one more awesome.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this statement are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I change my angels into wind and my servants into flaming fire. (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In the angels’ serving of me I can make them like wind or like flames of fire.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Tagbanwa back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate the meaning in a natural way to fit with the contrast between the angels and the Son in 1:8.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>winds:</strong> The quotation does not specify how God’s messengers are like <em>winds</em>. In some languages it may be more natural to use a singular form. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wind (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>servants:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>servants</em> usually refers to people who serve the public as respected officials. Their duties include religious responsibilities. Here the word refers to the angels as heavenly servants of God. God has given them great power to do his will. Use an appropriate word in your language to refer to such powerful servants. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>ministers (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>messengers</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:7b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The two statements in 1:7b are parallel, and “angels” and “servants” refer to the same beings. In some languages it may be more natural to translate the meaning without using parallel statements. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God created his angels to be his servants, and he can make them like wind or fire.</p></blockquote></div>",

He quoted from Psalm 45, which is a wedding song for a royal bridegroom. He applied these words of Psalm 45:6–7 to God’s Son. These verses are the fifth quotation that the author used to contrast the Son and the angels.</p><h4>1:8a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:8a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But about the Son He says:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But when he speaks of/to the Son, he says,</p></li><li><p>But about his Son God said,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But:</strong> The word <em>But</em> introduces the contrast with 1:7.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>about the Son He says:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>about</em> usually means “to,” but it can also mean <em>about</em>. Here it introduces the quotation that God spoke to his Son and also <em>about</em> him. You should use the natural way in your language to introduce the quotation. Some ways to introduce it in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But God said this about his Son: (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But of the Son he says (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But to the Son he says (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>1:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“O God, your<sup>(sing)</sup> kingdom will last/continue forever and ever,</p></li><li><p>“You<sup>(sing)</sup> are God, and you will rule <span data-bnType=\"implied\">your people</span> as <span data-bnType=\"implied\">their</span> king forever.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever:</strong> In this clause God spoke directly to Christ and called him <em>God</em>. The word <em>O</em> is not in the Greek text. It is often included in English versions when someone speaks directly to God, using a vocative.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a natural way in your language to address God directly. In some languages it may be more natural to put the word <em>God</em> at a different place in the sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God, your throne will last forever and ever (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You God, you will rule forever.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In other languages it may be more natural not to use a vocative. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You are God, and you will rule as King forever! (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Your throne…endures forever and ever:</strong> The word <em>throne</em> is used figuratively here. The phrase <em>Your throne</em> means “your ruling as king.” The whole clause means “Your rule lasts forever” or “You will be king forever.” Some other ways to translate it are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you are King forever<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Your kingdom…will last forever and ever!

The word <em>scepter</em> refers literally to a staff that belongs to a king. It is a symbol of his authority to rule his people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The whole clause means that the Son will use his authority fairly. He will rule his kingdom with justice. Some other ways to translate the clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You will rule your kingdom with justice.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You will rule your people fairly.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You use your royal power to do what is right/good.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>justice:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>justice</em> means “just, fair.” It has a similar meaning as the word “righteousness” in 1:9. For other ways to translate <em>justice</em>, see the preceding note. In some languages there may be an idiom to translate this. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>straightness</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>uprightness (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Your kingdom:</strong> The pronoun <em>Your</em> is singular. It refers here to Christ, the Son. God used the phrase <em>Your kingdom</em> to refer to the rule of Christ his Son over his people.</p>",

He does what is right, and he is pleased when other people do what is right. In this context the clause probably refers to how God’s Son rules people justly in his kingdom. Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You love what is right (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>All that is right is what you have valued</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Every work/action which is good is what pleases you very much.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Tagbanwa back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>You have loved:</strong> The pronoun <em>You</em> is singular and refers to God’s Son, the Christ. The verb <em>have loved</em> refers to the attitude that God’s Son has always had and still has. He has always loved righteousness, and he continues to love it. Some other ways to translate this meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you love</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you have <span data-bnType=\"implied\">always</span> loved</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>righteousness:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>righteousness</em> refers here to doing what is just and right according to a standard. In the Bible the standard of justice is determined by God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In this context <em>righteousness</em> probably refers specifically to the way that God’s Son rules people with justice. This fits with 1:8 that speaks of his kingdom and way of ruling. Some ways to translate <em>righteousness</em> in this context are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>All that is good<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>what is right (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>justice (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">For more information, see <u>just, sense C3</u>, in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and hated wickedness:</strong> The phrase <em>and hated wickedness</em> indicates that God’s Son detests evil and rejects it. Some other ways to translate the phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and you reject/detest actions that are lawless</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You are disgusted with evil behavior.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>wickedness:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>wickedness</em> is literally “lawlessness.” In the Bible it refers to not respecting or obeying God’s law. Some other ways to translate it are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>evil (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>what is wrong (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>lawlessness (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">For more information, see “lawlessness” under <u>sin, other words to compare</u>, in KBT.</p><h4>1:9b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 1:9b–c God continued to speak directly to his Son. In some languages it is necessary to indicate this by using first person pronouns like “I.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I, your God, have chosen you. I appointed you…. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God…has anointed You above Your companions with the oil of joy:</strong> The custom of anointing with oil is used here in a figurative way. When kings and priests were appointed, oil was poured on their heads to dedicate them to God for their work. It was a joyful occasion.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example, see 1 Kings 1:38–40.</span></span> In this verse the emphasis is on the joy (<em>joy</em>) and honor that God gave to his Son.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the clause are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate the figure of speech and indicate its meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God blessed you more than your companions and anointed you with oil, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the symbol of</span> joy.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God honored you more than your companions: he poured oil on you and made you glad.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God…has given you the joy of an honor far greater than he gave to your companions. (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate the meaning in a natural way in your language.</p><h4>1:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>therefore God, Your God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Because of this, God, your<sup>(sing)</sup> God,</p></li><li><p>That is why God, the God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">whom</span> you<sup>(sing)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">honor</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>therefore:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>therefore</em> means “because of this,” “for this reason.” It introduces what happened because God’s Son loved righteousness and hated wickedness (1:9a). Indicate this result in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God, Your God:</strong> In the phrase <em>God, Your God</em>, the word <em>God</em> is repeated for emphasis.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Another way to interpret the phrase <em>God, Your God</em> is that the first occurrence of <em>God</em> is used to address God’s Son as God. The second occurrence refers to God the Father. This interpretation is followed by the REB and NLT. However, most English versions, including the BSB, NIV, GNT, RSV, ESV, NASB, NCV, JBP, GW, NLT96, CEV, NET, KJV, and the NJB, interpret both occurrences of <em>God</em> to refer to God the Father.</span></span> The phrase <em>Your God</em> indicates that God is the One whom Christ the Son honors as God. The context also indicates that God has honored the Son.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>Your God</em> does not mean “the God you possess.” If a literal translation of <em>Your God</em> has a wrong meaning in your language, you may need to express the meaning in a different way. For example, in this context you may be able to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God who honors you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God whom you honor/obey</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Your:</strong> The pronoun <em>Your</em> is singular and refers to Christ, the Son of God.</p><h4>1:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>has anointed You above Your companions with the oil of joy.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>has poured oil on you<sup>(sing)</sup> to show that he has appointed you above everyone else.”</p></li><li><p>made you glad by giving you<sup>(sing)</sup> a great honor/position that he did not give to your companions.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>companions:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>companions</em> means “those who share or participate together” in something. The word occurs five times in Hebrews, once in Luke, and six times in the Greek OT (LXX).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Apart from Luke 5:7, where Peter shouts to their fishing “partners” to come and help with the big catch of fish, the author to Hebrews is the only New Testament author to use this word. It occurs here and in 3:1a, 3:14, 6:4c, and in 12:8, where the word describes believers. It is similar in meaning to the more common Greek word <em>koinōno</em> that can be translated as ‘partner.’</span></span> The author was probably referring here to the angels. In this whole section he was comparing Christ with the angels. Some ways to translate the word here are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>comrades</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>everyone else</p></blockquote><h4>1:9a–c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9a–c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(reordered) I am God, the God you </strong><span data-bnType=\"implied\"><strong>serve</strong></span><strong>.

Some other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The angels are servants of God but Jesus is his Son</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s Son is Superior to the Angels (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Greatness of God’s Son (GNT)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1059001010\" data-endVerseId=\"1059001012\"><h3>Paragraph 1:10–12</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Hebrews 1:10–12 contains the sixth quotation from the Old Testament.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This quote is from the Greek translation of the Old Testament (LXX). The Greek word that the BSB translates as “Lord” was often used in the LXX as a translation of the Hebrew word that is the personal name of God. Here in Hebrews 1:10 the author quoted it to indicate that God addressed Christ his Son as “Lord” (God).</span></span> It is from Psalm 102:25–27. In that Psalm, the psalmist said these words to God. But when the author of Hebrews quoted them in these verses, God spoke them to his Son. He called him “Lord.” God’s Son is the Lord who created heaven and earth. Heaven and earth will come to an end, but he is eternal and unchanging.</p></div><h4>1:10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> also says:</p></li><li><p>¶ Again, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> said <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to his Son</span>:</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And:</strong> The author used the word <em>And</em> here to introduce another statement that God said to his Son. It is also a quotation from the Old Testament. Some other ways to introduce it are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God also said (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He also says to the Son (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Introduce the quotation in a natural way in your language.</p><h4>1:10b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek text, 1:10b–c are in a different order, more literally:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And you from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the</span> beginning, Lord, founded the earth, and the heavens are works of your hands.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The word “you” is emphasized. God emphasized that his Son is God, the one who created the earth and the heavens. Use a natural word order in your language. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Lord, in the beginning you made the earth, and your hands made the skies. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages there may be a different way to emphasize the word “you.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It was you, Lord, who in the beginning…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>O Lord, You laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Your hands:</strong> In 1:10b–c there are two parallel statements:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10b</sup>Lord, You laid the foundations of the earth,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10c</sup>and the heavens are the work of Your hands.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The heavens refer to the sky and all that is in the sky. Together the phrases <em>the earth</em> and <em>the heavens</em> represent everything that God created. In some languages it may be more natural to combine these statements in one clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you Lord are the one who created the earth and everything that is in the sky<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><h4>1:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“In the beginning, O Lord, You laid the foundations of the earth,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“You<sup>(sing)</sup>, Lord, made the foundations of the earth in the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">very</span> beginning,</p></li><li><p>“Long ago, it was you<sup>(sing)</sup>, Lord, who made the earth,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>In the beginning:</strong> The phrase <em>In the beginning</em> refers to the time when God began to create everything that exists. At that time nothing existed. This phrase is similar to the first words of Genesis 1:1 and the first words of John 1:1. If you have translated those books, you may be able to use the same expression here. Some other ways to translate it are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Before anything was created</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>At the beginning of time</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Long ago</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you use a phrase like “Before anything existed,” be sure that it does not imply that God himself did not exist.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>laid the foundations of the earth:</strong> Here the author used figurative language to indicate that the Lord caused the earth to exist. The phrase does not mean that the earth has a literal foundation, as a building does.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to translate the meaning without using this figurative language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>created the earth</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>caused the earth to exist</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>made the earth</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you have a figurative way in your language to describe God creating the earth, you may be able to use it here.</p><h4>1:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and the heavens are the work of Your hands.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and with your<sup>(sing)</sup> own hands you made the heavens.</p></li><li><p>and you<sup>(sing)</sup> yourself made the sky and everything in it.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the heavens are the work of Your hands:</strong> The phrase <em>the work of Your hands</em> is a figure of speech. It emphasizes the fact that the Son himself created the heavens. Many languages may be able to translate this figure of speech directly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>With your own hands you made the heavens (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It was your hands that made the sky.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to translate the meaning of the figure of speech more directly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and you are the one who made the heavens</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the heavens:</strong> The phrase <em>the heavens</em> refers to the sky and everything in it, such as the sun, moon, and stars. The BSB probably uses the plural form of the English word <em>heavens</em> here because the Hebrew word is always plural. Use a natural way in your language to speak of the sky and what is in it. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the sky<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the skies and everything in them</p></blockquote>",

These verses contain several pairs of repetition. 1:11a is repeated in 1:11b–12c and in 1:12a–c. For examples of how to translate these two verses with less repetition, see the General Comment on 1:11–12 at the end of 1:12c.</p><h4>1:11a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:11a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>They will perish, but You remain;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They will come to an end, but you will live forever.

Together the earth and heavens represent the created universe.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but You remain:</strong> This clause contrasts with the preceding clause “you will perish.” The created world will end, but the Son will continue to exist (live) forever.

However, in this context it is probably used in a general sense to refer to any type of garment. Clothes eventually wear out, and the universe will also wear out.

The words of Psalm 110:1 are quoted in Matthew 22:44; Mark 12:36; Luke 20:42–43; and Acts 2:34–35, and they are also referred to in other passages.</p><h4>1:13a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Yet to which of the angels did God ever say:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Also/Moreover, did God ever say to any of the angels:</p></li><li><p>¶ God never said to any of the angels:</p></li><li><p>¶ As for the angels, God never said to one of them:</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Yet:</strong> The conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>Yet</em> introduces the final point in this chapter. Another way to introduce it in English is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Moreover</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Consider how you introduce an important point in your language. In some languages a conjunction may not be necessary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to which of the angels did God ever say:</strong> This clause is the first part of a rhetorical question. It is almost exactly the same as 1:5a, which began this section. It emphasizes the fact that God never said to any of the angels what he said to his son in 1:13b–c. It also implies a contrast. God did say those words to his Son. You should translate 1:13a in the same way (or a very similar way) as you translated 1:5a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>angels:</strong> The word <em>angels</em> refers to the spirit beings that serve God. This word occurred in 1:4. You may translate it in the same way here.</p><h4>1:13b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">The quotation in 1:13b–c is from Psalm 110:1. The author referred to it in 1:3.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet:</strong> Here God invited his Son to sit with him on his right side while God conquered his Son’s enemies. The context implies that God’s Son will also continue to sit with him after his enemies are conquered. In some languages a word like <em>until</em> may imply a limited time. If that is true in your language, it is better to translate it in a different way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Sit at my right side and I will make your enemies a footstool for you.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Sit here at my right while I make your enemies your footstool.</p></blockquote><h4>1:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Sit at My right hand</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“Sit by me at my right side (NCV)</p></li><li><p>“Sit with me in the highest position in heaven</p></li><li><p>“Sit in honor at my right hand (NLT)</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Sit at My right hand:</strong> The clause <em>Sit at My right hand</em> has the same figurative meaning as the phrase “sat down at the right hand” in 1:3e. It indicates that God told his Son to take the place of greatest honor and authority with God. You should translate the meaning in a similar way here. Some ways to translate it are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Sit by me at my right side (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Come sit here with me, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">sharing my authority</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Sit in honor at my right hand (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>1:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet”?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>until I make your<sup>(sing)</sup> enemies <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> a stool for your feet”? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">No,</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he never said that to any angel.</span></p></li><li><p>and/while I will put your<sup>(sing)</sup> enemies under your control.”</p></li><li><p>until I have conquered your<sup>(sing)</sup> enemies completely.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet:</strong> This clause refers to a custom of kings at that time. When a king defeated his enemies, he put his feet on them to show that he had complete power over them. In this context, the custom is a metaphor. It means that God will defeat his Son’s enemies, and the Son will have complete power over them. It does not indicate that the Son will literally place his feet on his enemies.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the figurative language are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use the same or different figurative language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>until you put your feet on the necks of your enemies</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>until I make your enemies kneel before you</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use figurative language and make the meaning explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>until I humble your enemies so that they are like a resting-place for your feet</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the figurative language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>until I have subdued your enemies completely</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>until I make all your enemies submit to you</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate the meaning in a natural way in your language. This metaphor is used again in 10:12–14.</p>",

All the quotations are poetry and contain figurative language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">You will need to decide:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>how to translate the <u>figurative language</u> in a clear and meaningful way.</p></li><li><p>whether to make <u>paragraph breaks</u> between these quotations. English versions differ in this.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example, the RSV begins a new paragraph only at 1:5. The GNT begins new paragraphs at 1:4, 1:7, and 1:14.</span></span> The Notes begin a new paragraph wherever the author has a quote introduction.</p></li><li><p>how to format the <u>quotations</u> and whether to include an OT cross reference. English versions differ about this also. If you have made a decision about this for other NT books, you may follow that decision in Hebrews also. The quotations in this section are poetry, so many English versions format them in poetic lines.</p></li><li><p>how to <u>introduce the quotations</u>. Some English versions use past tense (“God <u>said</u>”) to introduce the quotations, since God spoke the words in the past. Other versions use present tense (“God <u>says</u>”), since the statements are written in the Scripture and the time when he said them is not in focus. Use an appropriate verb form in your language.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">It is good to translate the section before you decide on a heading for it. Some other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The angels are servants of God but Jesus is his Son</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s Son is Superior to the Angels (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Greatness of God’s Son (GNT)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1059001013\" data-endVerseId=\"1059001014\"><h3>Paragraph 1:13–14</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph the author concluded the chapter with a final contrast between the Son and the angels. It shows again that God’s Son is far greater than the angels.</p></div><h4>1:14a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Are not the angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?:</strong> This verse ends the chapter with another rhetorical question. It contrasts the role of angels with the role of God’s Son. In 1:8–13 the author showed that God’s Son rules with God. Here in 1:14 he indicates that the angels are only servants. He uses a rhetorical question to make this contrast more emphatic.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate the rhetorical question are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Are they not all ministering spirits sent out in God’s service, for the sake of those destined to receive salvation? (REB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a question and supply the answer. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What are the angels, then? They are spirits who serve God and are sent by him to help those who are to receive salvation. (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But angels are only servants. They are spirits sent from God to care for those who will receive salvation. (NLT96)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate the rhetorical question in a way that will emphasize the contrast between the angels and the Son in your language.</p><h4>1:14a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:14a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Are not the angels ministering spirits</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>What are the angels, then?

It first occurs in this book in 1:4. Check to see how you have translated it there.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>ministering spirits:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>ministering spirits</em> refers to spirits who serve God. The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>ministering</em> comes from the same word as “servants” in 1:7b. See the note there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>spirits</em> is related to the same word that is translated as “winds” in 1:7, but here it has a different meaning. It refers to the spiritual nature of the angels. Angels are intelligent beings. When they appeared to people in the Bible, they had bodies that resembled human bodies. However, they are often invisible to people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a word like <em>spirits</em> may imply a wrong meaning. If that is true in your language, some other ways to translate <em>ministering spirits</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>beings who serve</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>powerful-ones who serve</p></blockquote><h4>1:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and are sent by him to help those who are to receive salvation.

God is the one who sends them. The word that is translated as <em>serve</em> is different from the word “ministering” in 1:14a, so you may translate them differently. Some other ways to translate <em>sent to serve</em> here are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>are sent by him to help (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whom God tells/commands to care for…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those who will inherit salvation:</strong> The clause <em>those who will inherit salvation</em> refers to people who will be rescued from sin and given eternal life with God. Some other ways to translate the clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those who will receive salvation (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the people who will be saved/rescued</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will save</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also the note on <em>salvation</em> below. You may also want to refer to how you translated “inherited” in 1:4.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>inherit:</strong> Often, the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>inherit</em> refers to receiving a person’s possessions after he dies. However, in this context it means “obtain.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDAG, page 547, lists “acquire, obtain, come into possession of” as the second meaning.</span></span> It does not imply that God will die.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>salvation:</strong> The word <em>salvation</em> refers to being rescued (saved) from something harmful or dangerous. A person may be saved from physical dangers like death or enemies or from spiritual dangers like sin and its punishment. In this context it refers to the spiritual sense of being saved from sin and from the punishment that a person deserves because of his sins. It also implies the blessings of being reconciled with God and being given eternal life with him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to translate <em>salvation</em> with a verb or phrase. If that is true in your language, you may need to supply some implied information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the people who are rescued <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to live forever with God</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>salvation</em> and the verb “to save” are among the most important words in the NT.

He warned them that if they did not pay attention to it, God would certainly punish them. Their punishment would be greater than the punishment of people who ignored the law, since the law was brought only by angels. This warning is the first of five important warnings in the book of Hebrews.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be helpful to change the order of some of the parts of 2:2–3 to help readers understand the contrast between the law and the salvation that the Son brought. See the General Comment on 2:2–3 at the end of 2:3b for an example.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">It is good to translate the section before you decide on a heading for it. Some other possible headings are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Warning Against Neglecting Salvation (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We must give earnest attention to what we have heard</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Some translators decide to combine this section with 2:5–10.

If the author was making a true comparison he did not specify exactly the type of attention that he was telling them to exceed. Some possibilities are: (1) They should pay more attention to his salvation than the Israelites paid attention to the Law.(2) They should pay more attention to his salvation than they would give if the message of salvation had been given by angels (instead of by God himself).(3) They should pay more attention to his salvation than they were paying to it when the author wrote/spoke (Hebrews) to them.No English version makes any of these interpretations explicit. If you need to make one of them explicit, it is recommended that you choose interpretation (1). It fits the context especially well. For more information, see the excellent discussion in Translator’s Handbook (page 26).</span></span> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>must pay closer attention</em> is literally “it is necessary much-more to hold-to.” It indicates that it is necessary to think seriously about (what God has said), to believe it and obey it carefully.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Greek verb <em>prosexō</em> that is translated as <em>pay…attention</em> is used in non-biblical writings to mean “have in close proximity to.” (BDAG, page 879) Here in Hebrews it may be used figuratively to indicate that people should “hold firmly” to the message they have heard from God’s Son. This meaning would go with the figure of speech “drift away” in 2:1b. (A boat must remain firmly tied or anchored to one place or it will drift away, and we must remain attached to what God has said or we will stop obeying it.)</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages there may be a figurative way to talk about this type of careful attention. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>hold on all the more firmly to (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>take what we have heard and grip it more tightly</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>be more careful to follow (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may not be natural to use a comparison without being specific about what is being compared. If that is true in your language, you may want to emphasize the careful attention without the comparison. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>listen very carefully (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>give our full attention (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>therefore:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>therefore</em> is literally “because of this.” The BSB puts <em>therefore</em> in the middle of the clause because this is good English style, but the Greek phrase occurs at the beginning of the verse. Put the transition word or phrase wherever it is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>therefore</em> introduces what people should do as a result of what the author said in chapter 1: Now God has spoken to us through a Son (not just through angels), <em>therefore</em> we must pay greater attention to what we have heard through God’s Son.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this connection are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>For this reason (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>That is why (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is necessary to refer back to the theme of chapter 1 more specifically. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Since the greatness of God’s Child is like this<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Because all this is true (UBS)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Connect this verse to chapter 1 in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to what we have heard:</strong> The clause <em>to what we have heard</em> refers to what God spoke to his people through his Son Jesus. The author and readers of Hebrews heard it from Jesus or his apostles or other people who proclaimed it. In 2:3 the author indicates that what they heard was about salvation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is necessary to make the phrase <em>what we have heard</em> more specific. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the message that we have heard</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the truth which was taught us<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Tagbanwa back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the good news which was told to us<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><h4>2:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that we do not drift away.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that we<sup>(incl)</sup> will not be turned/carried away <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from it</span>.</p></li><li><p>Otherwise, we<sup>(incl)</sup> may <span data-bnType=\"implied\">gradually</span> forget/ignore <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what we heard about him</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that we do not drift away:</strong> The phrase <em>so that…not</em> introduces the purpose for the action in 2:1a. This purpose is to avoid drifting away from what God spoke through his Son. This purpose is also an implied warning. It implies that if we do not pay attention to the message (2:1a), we will drift away from it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this purpose and warning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>or we may drift away from it (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Then we will not drift away from it.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we:</strong> The pronoun <em>we</em> is inclusive and refers to the author and anyone who hears or reads this letter.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>do not drift away:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>drift away</em> often describes how a boat can be carried away by water to a different place. In this verse the verb is used as a figure of speech. It refers to the way that we might stop believing and obeying the truth if we do not pay attention to it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages this figure of speech may be difficult to understand. It may be more natural to translate the meaning in a different way. For example:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a figure of speech with a similar meaning in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>will not stray away from the truth (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>will not gradually stop believing/obeying it</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Some translations supply the phrase “from it” to indicate that <em>drift away</em> refers back to “what we have heard” in 2:2a. Make this clear in a natural way in your language.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:1b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In this part of the verse the author used the action of drifting away (on a boat) as a figure of speech. In 6:19 he used a similar figure of speech. He compared our hope to an anchor (the heavy object that keeps a boat from drifting away).</p></div>",

He did this to convince his readers that it was even more important to pay attention to the message of Jesus than to the law of Moses.</p><h4>2:2a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For if the message spoken by angels was binding,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We</span><sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">know that</span> it was necessary to obey the message which angels gave,</p></li><li><p>The message <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the law</span> given <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to our</span><sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">ancestors</span> by the angels was shown to be true,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> The conjunction <em>For</em> introduces a reason for what the author said in 2:1.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Another way to describe this connection is in terms of basis-exhortation.

Connect this reason to 2:1 in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if:</strong> The word <em>if</em> introduces a clause that tells two facts about the angels’ message. This type of clause indicates that the facts in it are true. Both the author and the readers already knew these facts, and the author used those facts as the basis and support for what he said in 2:3. Here is another way to translate this basis and introduce the conclusion:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We know that</span> the message that angels brought was valid. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">We also know that</span> every violation or disobedience of it was justly punished. So…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See the General Comment on 2:2–3 at the end of 2:3b for examples of ways to translate the basis and conclusion in these verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the message spoken by angels:</strong> The phrase <em>the message</em> refers here to God’s Law (literally “word”) that was spoken by angels. It contrasts with what was spoken by the Lord (2:3). The Scriptures suggest that God used angels to give his law to Moses, and then Moses gave the law to the Israelites.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Other Scriptures that indicate that God used angels in some way to give his Law to people are Acts 7:53 and Galatians 3:19. There may also be a poetic reference to this in Deuteronomy 33:2.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">God’s law consisted of many laws (which are written in Genesis-Deuteronomy). The word <em>message</em> does not refer to only one particular law. It also does not refer to the type of message that is a short statement or request.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s word spoken through angels (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those laws of God that he caused the angels to speak<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Tagbanwa back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the laws/words that God gave <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> through the angels</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>spoken:</strong> The verb <em>spoken</em> is passive. In some languages it is more natural to use an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the message which angels spoke/gave…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>angels:</strong> The word <em>angels</em> occurred in 1:4. You should translate it in the same way here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>was binding:</strong> The word <em>binding</em> means “legally binding, firm, and in force.” It indicates here that those who received the law had to obey it. The context implies that God would enforce the law. Other ways to translate the word in this context are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>proved to be so firm that… (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it was not possible to ignore/change that law</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it was required/necessary that people obey that law</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The author will use the word again in 3:6, 3:14, 6:19, and 9:17.</p><h4>2:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and every transgression and disobedience received its just punishment,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and whoever did not obey it or follow it received the appropriate punishment,</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> justly punished anyone who disobeyed it.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">The clause in 2:2b is the second part of the condition that began in 2:2a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and every transgression and disobedience received its just punishment:</strong> This clause indicates that everyone who broke the law or disobeyed it was justly punished. In some languages it may be necessary to indicate explicitly that 2:2b is also part of the condition that began in 2:2a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and if anyone broke <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that law</span> or disobeyed it, that person was justly punished</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and since everyone breaking that law received/suffered the proper penalty</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In the law God specified the proper punishment for various offenses. The leaders and the whole community of Israel were responsible to ensure that the people were punished in those ways.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to indicate who punished the people. If that is true in your language, you may supply “God” as the subject or you may use an indefinite subject. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God/They</span> justly punished everyone who violated or disobeyed it.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>every transgression and disobedience:</strong> The words <em>transgression</em> and <em>disobedience</em> have a similar meaning. In some languages it is helpful to translate this meaning with one phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all who did not do what the law told them to do</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>every transgression:</strong> The word <em>transgression</em> refers to doing something that God forbids in the law or not doing something that he commands. This word is used again in 9:15, as well as in other places in the NT.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example, Romans 2:23, 4:15, 5:14; Galatians 3:19; 1 Timothy 2:14.</span></span> Some other ways to translate <em>every transgression</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>every time a person did not follow/obey it</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>whenever anyone broke it</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">For more information, see “transgression” under <u>sin, other words to compare</u> in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>disobedience:</strong> The word <em>disobedience</em> refers to a refusal to listen and obey. The implied object is the message, which was the law that the angels brought.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This word only occurs here and in Romans 5:19 and 2 Corinthians 10:6.</span></span> Some other ways to translate it are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>did not…obey it (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>rejected it<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>its just punishment:</strong> The phrase <em>its just punishment</em> implies that in the law there was a proper punishment for each disobedience. The law specified the particular punishment that a person should receive for various disobedient actions. The word <em>just</em> means “right, fair, deserved.” A <em>just punishment</em> was a fair or right punishment.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate this meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and whenever a person disobeyed any of the laws, he was punished in a fair way</p></blockquote>",

He warned them that if they did not pay attention to it, God would certainly punish them. Their punishment would be greater than the punishment of people who ignored the law, since the law was brought only by angels. This warning is the first of five important warnings in the book of Hebrews.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be helpful to change the order of some of the parts of 2:2–3 to help readers understand the contrast between the law and the salvation that the Son brought.

See the translation examples in the preceding note.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>such a great salvation:</strong> The phrase <em>such a great salvation</em> refers to the message about the great salvation that God has spoken of through his Son.

In this context it refers to being rescued from sin. It implies that the people who are saved will not be judged and condemned because of sins. They will be reconciled with God and his people. Some other ways to translate it here are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>deliverance</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>freedom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from sin/judgment</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See the preceding note for examples of using a verb to translate <em>salvation</em>.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:2–3</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Hebrews 2:2–3 is one long sentence. You may need to divide it into several different sentences. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2</sup>The message <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about the law</span> which the angels brought could not be changed. Those who broke the law or who disobeyed it were justly punished. <sup>3</sup>So how can we escape <span data-bnType=\"implied\">being punished by God</span> if we ignore <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the message about</span> such a great salvation?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2</sup>Angels brought a message which could not be changed. God rightly punished those who broke the law or who disobeyed it. <sup>3</sup>So we also cannot escape if we pay no attention when God offers to save us so wonderfully.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek text the parts of 2:1–3 are arranged as a chiasm to emphasize the contrast between the message spoken by the Lord and the message received through angels.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This special arrangement is a chiasm. The Notes shows this chiasm by using the same capital letters (A, A&apos;; B, B&apos;…) to indicate that the clauses have similar meanings:A Because of this, it is necessary B for <strong>us:</strong> to pay attention more carefully C to the things we have <strong>heard</strong>, lest we drift away from it.

Therefore, <sup>3b</sup>if we neglect his message, <sup>3a</sup>there is no way that we can escape punishment!</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:3c–4</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek text, verses 2:3c–4 continue the long sentence that began at 2:2. Many versions begin a new sentence at 2:3c–4, and some translate 2:3c and 2:4 as separate sentences. Divide or connect the parts of the sentences in a natural way in your language.</p><h4>2:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>This salvation was first announced by the Lord,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It was the Lord who first spoke about this salvation,</p></li><li><p>The Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus</span> himself first proclaimed the message about this way that God provided to save <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>This salvation was first announced by the Lord:</strong> This is a passive clause. It indicates that the Lord Jesus was the first person to tell people about the great salvation. The words <em>This salvation</em> refer to the “great salvation” that was mentioned at the end of 2:3b.

Translate it in a natural way in your language for this context.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Lord:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Lord</em> means “someone who has authority over people In Greek this word can be used to refer to God and also to others who have great authority.

Some ways to translate it are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a passive clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it was confirmed to us by those who heard (NASB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and those who heard him confirmed it to us (REB)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>confirmed to us by those who heard Him:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>confirmed</em> indicates that people who heard Jesus speak repeated what he said to other people, including the author of Hebrews. They confirmed that what Jesus said about God’s salvation was true. Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and those who listened to him told us that it was certainly true</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And people who heard that message from his very lips, they were the ones who recounted it to us, with the result that we know that it is true.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>those who heard Him:</strong> The phrase <em>those who heard Him</em> refers to the apostles and other disciples who listened to Jesus while he was living with them on earth. The BSB has supplied the word <em>Him</em> to make the sentence more natural in English. It is not in the Greek text. Some English versions supply “it” instead. The meaning is almost the same, since the text refers to hearing what Jesus said.</p>",

Some other ways to translate the phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he caused them to do amazing miracles to show that the message was true</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God helped them to do this work in that they did miracles before the people<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all kinds of miracles and wonders (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">These words also occur together in Acts 2:22; 2 Corinthians 12:12 and 2 Thessalonians 2:9. If you have translated these passages, see how you translated the words there. See also the notes on each word below. For more information, see <u>miracle, sign, wonder, mighty work</u> in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>signs:</strong> The word <em>signs</em> refers to miracles that have a meaning. They show or prove something. Here the <em>signs</em> showed that Jesus’ message about God’s way of salvation was true.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The word <em>signs</em> is also used in the Gospel of John in this sense, for example, in John 2:11, 3:2, and 4:48.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>wonders:</strong> The word <em>wonders</em> refers to amazing events or actions. It often occurs with the word “signs” to refer to actions that God causes his messengers to be able to perform.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>various miracles:</strong> The Greek word for <em>miracles</em> is the plural of the noun “power.” It can refer to a miraculous act of healing or to another act which cannot be done by human power or knowledge. The word <em>various</em> means “many kinds.” Other ways to translate the phrase <em>various miracles</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>many kinds of miracles (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>other powerful acts (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>2:4c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:4c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to His will.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and by distributing gifts from the Holy Spirit <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to people</span> as he wanted.</p></li><li><p>and with other gifts from the Holy Spirit that he decided <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to give</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to His will:</strong> The phrase <em>and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to His will</em> is another way by which God showed that the message of salvation was true. In some languages it may be helpful to translate 2:4c as a separate sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He also confirmed the message by causing the Holy Spirit to distribute special abilities. He did this just the way he wanted to do it.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to His will:</strong> Scholars differ over the exact meaning of this phrase. The most likely meaning is that when God gives his Holy Spirit to people, the Holy Spirit causes them to have the various powers and abilities that God wants them to have. Through using these abilities (<em>gifts</em>), his people show that the message of salvation is true.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and with other gifts from the Holy Spirit as he wanted (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and he gave them other kinds of power from the Holy Spirit, just as he decided to give <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to each one</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Holy Spirit:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>Holy Spirit</em> refers to the Spirit of God. The Holy Spirit is God, together with God the Father and God the Son. The Holy Spirit is “spirit” in the sense that he is a living being who does not have a physical body. He is “holy” in the sense that he is God and unique from every other being. He is perfect in every way and is completely pure and sinless.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate <em>Holy Spirit</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Spirit/Breath of God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Holy/Sacred Spirit</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Do not imply that the <em>Holy Spirit</em> is like the ghost of a dead person or that God has died.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>according to His will:</strong> The phrase <em>according to His will</em> means “just as God wanted.” In some languages it is more natural to translate the phrase <em>His will</em> with a verb or clause. For instance:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>just as he wanted (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>as he himself chose</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also the examples in the preceding note.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:4a–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek this verse is the final part of a sentence that began in 2:2. Most English versions begin a new sentence here.

These verses contain a quote from Psalm 8:4–6. The psalm refers to “man” and “son of man,” and uses words like “him” and “his.” In the psalm these words refer to human beings (mankind) in general. However, there are two ways to interpret these forms when they are quoted here in Hebrews 2:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>They refer to both humanity and to Jesus as the Messiah. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What is a mortal that you should remember him, the Son of Man that you care for him? (GW) <em>(BSB, NIV84, RSV, ESV, GW, REB, NASB, NET, NLT96, JBP, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>They refer only to humanity. This interpretation is implied by English versions that use plural or collective forms. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What are human beings that you are mindful of them, or mortals, that you care for them? (NRSV) <em>(NIV, GNT, CEV, NRSV, NJB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). The author of Hebrews often used verses from the OT as evidence that Jesus is the Messiah. A number of commentaries, including recent ones, also support this interpretation.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is a growing number of scholars supporting the Messianic tones of Hebrews 2:6–8: Koester (page 221) says, “A tension in the psalm enables it to bear two different lines of interpretation…. The psalm asks about God’s will for ‘man,’ which can be understood as a question about humankind generally so that Hebrews can deal with God’s design for people…. The psalm can also be taken as a statement about Jesus, who is God’s Son and heir of all things.” Lane (47) says that when the author of Hebrews quotes the statement in Psalm 8 “You put everything in subjection under his feet” (verse 8a), he “immediately adds, we do not yet…see everything subject to his control.” Lane sees this “not yet” as crucial, “for it indicates that the writer found in the quotation a prophecy that will eventually be fulfilled.” He continues (page 48) to explain that since the psalmist recognized that this prophecy has not yet been fulfilled, the author of Hebrews sees “that the promised subjection has reference not to humankind in general (verse 8), but to Jesus (verse 9), whom God has appointed ‘heir of everything.” See also O’Brien (pages 91–93) and Attridge (page 72). For a detailed article on this topic see Guthrie and Quinn (2006: pages 235–246).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may not be possible to use a singular form to refer to human beings in general. If this is true in your language, you may want to include a footnote in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Some scholars believe that “son of man” is used in the psalm to refer to humans in general. However, the author of Hebrews also used it to refer to Jesus as the Messiah who “leads many sons to glory” (2:10). Jesus is the one who fulfilled the psalm’s prophecy that God put all things under mankind’s control.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">It is clear that in the OT the psalmist is praising God for choosing “human beings” to rule over creation. However, the author of Hebrews does not have <u>only</u> humanity in mind. He also uses the psalm to refer to the Messiah. He implies that the psalmist also spoke about Jesus becoming human and being crowned with glory and honor.</p></div><h4>2:5</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:5\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For it is not to angels that He has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ It was not angels whom God appointed to rule the future world that we<sup>(incl)</sup> speak of.</p></li><li><p>¶ God did not give angels authority over the world/life that will soon begin, about which I speak <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to you</span><sup>(plur)</sup>.</p></li><li><p>¶ As for the future world that I am talking about, God did not say that angels will be its leaders.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates literally as <em>For</em> is the same conjunction that it translated as “for” in 2:2. It introduces a second reason and explanation for saying that we must pay attention to what we have heard (2:1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Scholars have different opinions about the function of the Greek conjunction here. The <em>Exegetical Summary on Hebrews</em> (pages 52–53) lists the following: “1. It indicates the grounds for the argument of the preceding verses…. 2. It indicates the second grounds for the exhortation in 2:1…. 3. It indicates the grounds for 1:14…. 4. It indicates the grounds for the exhortation to dedication to salvation through the Son…. 5. It links the present discussion with the preceding discussion concerning the Son’s supremacy…. It is another reason to emphasize the Son’s superiority…. 6. It opens a new stage in the discussion….” These views are not mutually exclusive. The Notes follow the view expressed in option 2, interpreting the word “Now” as an introduction to the second grounds for the exhortation in 2:1. Instead of the word “grounds,” the Notes uses the words “reason and explanation,” as representing the same meaning but being perhaps easier for speakers of English as a second language to understand.</span></span> Some versions use the English word “Now,” but it does not refer to time here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions translate the Greek conjunction as “for” or “because.” Other versions do not have a conjunction here. Connect this paragraph to the preceding section in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it is not to angels that He has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking:</strong> In Greek this clause is more literally “not…to angels he subordinated the coming world about which we speak.” The clause emphasizes that it was <u>not</u> <em>angels</em> whom God chose to rule the future world. It implies that he chose a different ruler (or rulers) for it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the clause in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God did not subject the coming world, about which we are speaking, to angels. (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>For God did not say that angels will be the ones to control the coming world of which we speak.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>As for the future world that we are telling about, it is not the angels whom God chose to rule it.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>angels:</strong> The word <em>angels</em> here refers to the spirit beings that serve God. It first occurs in this book in 1:4. You should translate it in the same way here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>angels</em> is in an emphatic position in the Greek sentence to show that the author was making a contrast. It is not <u>angels</u> who will rule over the world to come. Human beings will rule it with Jesus as the leader.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the world to come:</strong> The phrase <em>the world to come</em> refers to the world that will exist in the future. The word <em>world</em> refers mainly to the way of life in that future place. The word <em>come</em> refers especially to the time when Jesus will come again and rule everyone.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate <em>the world to come</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the future world (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the life that will replace <span data-bnType=\"implied\">this present life</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>about which we are speaking:</strong> Here the pronoun <em>we</em> refers to the author. He often referred to himself in this way in the book of Hebrews. Another way to translate this phrase is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>about which I speak</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, when the author used the word <em>we</em>, he probably implied that his listeners were thinking with him about the truths that he was telling them. Use an appropriate pronoun in your language here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>about which we are speaking</em> is an explanatory comment, so you will need to make that clear in a natural way in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the new world to come—the world of which we speak (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the future life. This is the life I am talking about.</p></blockquote>",

This quotation agrees with what 2:5 says and supports it. In some languages a word like <em>But</em> may be confusing here. If that is true in your language, some other ways to translate the connection between 2:5 and 2:6 are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a word or phrase that introduces a supporting statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In fact</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Do not use a conjunction. For example, the RSV begins 2:6 with the statement itself:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It has been testified somewhere (RSV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate the connection between 2:5 and 2:6 in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>somewhere it is testified:</strong> This clause refers to a quotation from the OT Scriptures. The verb <em>is testified</em> implies here that God inspired someone to write it, and that person affirmed that it is true.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Lane (<em>Hebrews 1–8</em>, page 46) says, “Precisely because it is God who speaks in the OT, the identity of the person through whom he uttered his word is relatively unimportant. A vague allusion is sufficient.”</span></span> The general term <em>somewhere</em> does not imply that the author did not know the particular book of the Scriptures where the quote is found.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>For somewhere in the Scriptures it says (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that is the meaning of what God caused to be written, which says:</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Somewhere in the Scriptures someone says to God (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You may want to use the term for “Scriptures” that you have used in other verses in the NT.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>somewhere:</strong> The word <em>somewhere</em> refers here to a part of the Scriptures. In some languages it is helpful to include your word or phrase for the Scriptures. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in the Holy Book<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>it is testified:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>it is testified</em> means to solemnly declare the truth about something. The author used this verb to indicate the truth and importance of the part of Scripture that he was about to quote. It does not imply that it was used as a testimony in court.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the verb are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>has declared (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>There is…this solemn assurance (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Verses 2:6b–8a are a quotation from Psalm 8:4–6. If you use footnotes in your translation, you can put the reference in a footnote.</p><h4>2:6b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">The words in 2:6b–c are a quotation from Psalm 8:5. In that psalm, 8:5 is part of a longer prayer to God. In 8:2 the psalmist addressed God directly as Lord. Here in Hebrews, it may be helpful to make explicit that the person is praying to God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Lord, what is man…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What are human beings, O God (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek text the word that the BSB translates as “man” is also singular.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>What is man that You are mindful of him, or the son of man that You care for him:</strong> The words in 2:6b–c are a quotation from Psalm 8, which is Hebrew poetry. The quotation begins with two rhetorical questions that have the same meaning. In the example below, the parts that are similar in meaning are marked in similar ways:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6b</sup>What is <u>man</u>, that you <strong>are mindful of</strong> him,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6c</sup>or the <u>son of man</u>, that you <strong>care for</strong> him?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The question in 2:6c has an ellipsis. The phrase <em>What is</em> from 2:6b is also implied in 2:6c. In some languages it may be necessary to make it explicit in 2:6c. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>6c</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what is</span> a human being that you care for him?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it will be more natural to combine these two questions into one. For examples of how these quotations can be combined, see the General Comment on 2:6b–c at the end of 2:6c.</p><h4>2:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“What is man that You are mindful of him,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“What makes you<sup>(sing)</sup> so concerned about man?</p></li><li><p>“It is amazing that you<sup>(sing)</sup> care about a human being.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>What is man that You are mindful of him:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. It expresses surprise that God should be concerned about a human being at all. Some ways to translate this surprise are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What makes you care about a human being?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Does a man have any status/importance? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">No,</span> so what causes you to care for him?</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement or exclamation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I cannot understand</span> why a human being is important to you!</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this surprise in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>man:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>man</em> means “human being.” The word is singular. It can refer to a single human being or to mankind in general (both male and female). Some scholars believe that the author used this singular form because he intended to be ambiguous. He wanted to use a word that could refer either to the Son of Man as Messiah (Jesus) or to human beings in general.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If it is possible in your language to be ambiguous in that way here, that is a good choice. In some languages that may not be natural or it may imply a wrong meaning. If that is true in your language, you may use a plural form like “human beings,” as in the NRSV. The form should include both the author and the readers. Use appropriate forms in 2:7–8 also.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>that You are mindful of him:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>mindful</em> means “remember.” When it is used about God remembering a person or persons, it implies that he remembers them in order to help and care for them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate <em>that You are mindful of him</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that you think of him (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that you are concerned for him</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>You:</strong> The pronoun <em>You</em> refers to God. The psalmist was speaking to God, so he used a singular form of <em>You</em>.</p><h4>2:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>or the son of man that You care for him?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">What importance does</span> a person have that you<sup>(sing)</sup> take care of him?</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am amazed</span> that you<sup>(sing)</sup> show concern for him, since he is only human.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>or the son of man that You care for him:</strong> In Greek this clause is more literally “or son of (a) human-being that you care for him.” Like 2:6b, it is also a rhetorical question. It expresses surprise and has the same meaning as 2:6b. Be sure that you have read the note on 2:6b–c before you read the rest of this note.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What is a mortal that you should remember him… (GW)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am amazed</span> that you are concerned about mankind</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span> do not know/understand why you care for a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">mere</span> human being.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate the clause in 2:6c in the way that is natural in your language for expressing surprise. See the General Comment on 2:6b–c at the end of 2:6c for ways to combine the parts of this verse.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the son of man:</strong> In this context, the phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the son of man</em> can refer to any human being and it can refer specifically to the Messiah.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some Bible scholars believe that the phrase “son of man” refers here to Christ as the Son of Man. In the context of the quotation from Psalm 8, it probably referred to mankind (to human beings in general). In the Greek text of 2:6c the phrase <em>son of man</em> is parallel to “man” in 2:6b. In the context of Hebrews, the author was applying this quotation not only to humanity in general but especially to the Messiah in particular. As Koester (page 215) says, “The use of language from Psalm 8 for Jesus (e.g., Matthew 21:16) does not suggest that the psalm had come to have an exclusively messianic sense by the time Hebrews was written, and Hebrews uses the psalm both for humanity and for Jesus.”</span></span> It indicates that the author wondered why God concerned himself with a human being. A human seems unimportant compared to God. In some languages it is possible to use the same key term for <em>son of man</em> here that you used in the Gospels.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate <em>the son of man</em> here are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>human being</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>person</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>that You care for him:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>care for</em> means “be concerned about, show concern for.” Other ways to translate the clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that you notice him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that you take good care of him</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:6b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The two questions in 2:6b and 2:6c are quoted from Hebrew poetry. It is common in Hebrew poetry for an author to use similar statements to emphasize his meaning. The rhetorical questions in 2:6b and 2:6c are very similar in meaning. In some languages it will be more natural to combine these two questions into one.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some ways that you can combine these two questions are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Why do you think about or care about a human being?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What is a human being that you should be concerned about him?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Why should you care about a human being?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">However, the author probably interprets Psalm 8 to be speaking of the Messiah, as well as of human beings.</p></div>",

These verses contain a quote from Psalm 8:4–6. The psalm refers to “man” and “son of man,” and uses words like “him” and “his.” In the psalm these words refer to human beings (mankind) in general. However, there are two ways to interpret these forms when they are quoted here in Hebrews 2:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>They refer to both humanity and to Jesus as the Messiah. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What is a mortal that you should remember him, the Son of Man that you care for him? (GW) <em>(BSB, NIV84, RSV, ESV, GW, REB, NASB, NET, NLT96, JBP, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>They refer only to humanity. This interpretation is implied by English versions that use plural or collective forms. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What are human beings that you are mindful of them, or mortals, that you care for them? (NRSV) <em>(NIV, GNT, CEV, NRSV, NJB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). The author of Hebrews often used verses from the OT as evidence that Jesus is the Messiah. A number of commentaries, including recent ones, also support this interpretation.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is a growing number of scholars supporting the Messianic tones of Hebrews 2:6–8: Koester (page 221) says, “A tension in the psalm enables it to bear two different lines of interpretation…. The psalm asks about God’s will for ‘man,’ which can be understood as a question about humankind generally so that Hebrews can deal with God’s design for people…. The psalm can also be taken as a statement about Jesus, who is God’s Son and heir of all things.” Lane (47) says that when the author of Hebrews quotes the statement in Psalm 8 “You put everything in subjection under his feet” (verse 8a), he “immediately adds, we do not yet…see everything subject to his control.” Lane sees this “not yet” as crucial, “for it indicates that the writer found in the quotation a prophecy that will eventually be fulfilled.” He continues (page 48) to explain that since the psalmist recognized that this prophecy has not yet been fulfilled, the author of Hebrews sees “that the promised subjection has reference not to humankind in general (verse 8), but to Jesus (verse 9), whom God has appointed ‘heir of everything.” See also O’Brien (pages 91–93) and Attridge (page 72). For a detailed article on this topic see Guthrie and Quinn (2006: pages 235–246).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may not be possible to use a singular form to refer to human beings in general. If this is true in your language, you may want to include a footnote in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Some scholars believe that “son of man” is used in the psalm to refer to humans in general. However, the author of Hebrews also used it to refer to Jesus as the Messiah who “leads many sons to glory” (2:10). Jesus is the one who fulfilled the psalm’s prophecy that God put all things under mankind’s control.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">It is clear that in the OT the psalmist is praising God for choosing “human beings” to rule over creation. However, the author of Hebrews does not have <u>only</u> humanity in mind. He also uses the psalm to refer to the Messiah. He implies that the psalmist also spoke about Jesus becoming human and being crowned with glory and honor.</p></div><h4>2:7</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">There is a textual issue at the end of this verse. Some Greek manuscripts include another clause that can be translated as “and set them over the works of your hands.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A number of English versions include notes with this option. For example, the NRSV note says, “Other ancient authorities add <em>and set them over the works of your hands</em>.”</span></span> In these manuscripts this clause completes Psalm 8:6. The two textual options are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Most Greek manuscripts do not have this clause, and most English versions do not translate it. <em>(BSB, NIV, CEV, NJB, NLT, GNT, NRSV, GW, NCV, REB, NET, ESV)</em></p></li><li><p>Other Greek manuscripts have this Greek clause. This is followed by only a few English versions. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and have appointed him over the works of your hands<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NASB uses all capital letters for Old Testament quotations. For the <em>Translator’s Notes</em> these letters have been changed to lower case to correspond to what the other versions have done.</span></span> (NASB) <em>(KJV, NASB, JBP)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">It is recommended that you follow option (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NET note has a more detailed summary of this issue: “Several witnesses, many of them early and important…have at the end of verse 7, “You have given him dominion over the works of your hands.” Other MSS, not quite as impressive in weight, lack the words…. In spite of the impressive external evidence for the longer reading, it is most likely a scribal addition to conform the text of Hebrews to Psalm 8:6 (8:7 LXX). Conformity of a NT quotation of the OT to the LXX was a routine scribal activity….”</span></span> Most English versions follow this option. However, since there is also good manuscript evidence for option (2), you may include it in a footnote, as many English versions do. For example, the GNT has this footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Many manuscripts add: You made them rulers over everything you made (see Psalm 8:6).</p></blockquote><h4>2:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>You made him a little lower than the angels;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You<sup>(sing)</sup> caused him to have lower status than the angels for a little while.</p></li><li><p>For a short time, you<sup>(sing)</sup> gave the human being less status/honor than the angels,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You made him a little lower than the angels:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the phrase <em>a little</em> in this clause:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to <u>a short time</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You made him lower than the angels for a little while (NET) <em>(ESV, GNT, NRSV, NET, REB, NLT96, NCV, NASB, NJB)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The following commentators follow this view: Hughes (Eerdmans), Moffatt (ICC), Ellingworth (NIGTC), Ellingworth and Nida (TH), Lane (WBC).</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to <u>a slightly lower status</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You made him a little lower than the angels. (GW) <em>(BSB, NIV, NLT, GW, KJV)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The following commentators follow this view: Montefiore (HNTC), Lenski, and Miller.</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). The words that the author quoted from Psalm 2 referred to the status of people, but here in Hebrews the author used the words to refer to a period of time.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to translate this interpretation is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>For this short time</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>him:</strong> The pronoun <em>him</em> is the same as the one that was used in 2:6. See the note on 2:6b. Make sure to indicate this clearly. In English this is done by using the appropriate pronoun.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>lower:</strong> The word <em>lower</em> refers here to having less status or dignity than someone else. Some other ways to translate it are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>more humble/unimportant</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>power made less than</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some cultures there are figurative ways to say that someone has lower status than someone else. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>was downhill <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in status</span> a little<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate the meaning in a natural way in your language.</p><h4>2:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>You crowned him with glory and honor</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You<sup>(sing)</sup> honored him by giving him splendor/greatness and respect,</p></li><li><p>but then you<sup>(sing)</sup> rewarded him with great authority and caused <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> to honor him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You crowned him with glory and honor:</strong> This clause indicates that God rewarded man by giving him glory and honor. The text continues to refer here both to mankind and to the Messiah. The verb <em>crowned</em> is used in a figurative way. It refers to the custom of honoring someone by placing a wreath (“crown”) of leaves on his head.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Among Greek people this custom was used to honor the winner of a race or other competition.</span></span> Here the figure of speech indicates that God honored man by giving him authority and respect.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages the metaphor of a “crown” may not have this meaning. Some other ways to translate the metaphor are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you gave him an honored position/seat<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you caused him to be greatly respected</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>him:</strong> The pronoun <em>him</em> is the same as the one that was used in 2:7a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>glory and honor:</strong> In this context the words <em>glory and honor</em> are very similar in meaning. Both words refer to a position of great importance. In this context the importance is connected with authority to rule over God’s creation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to use a single phrase to translate <em>glory and honor</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a position of great status/authority</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate <em>glory and honor</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>greatly honored him like the honor of a king</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>made him like a great king who is admired/respected</p></blockquote>",

These verses contain a quote from Psalm 8:4–6. The psalm refers to “man” and “son of man,” and uses words like “him” and “his.” In the psalm these words refer to human beings (mankind) in general. However, there are two ways to interpret these forms when they are quoted here in Hebrews 2:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>They refer to both humanity and to Jesus as the Messiah. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What is a mortal that you should remember him, the Son of Man that you care for him? (GW) <em>(BSB, NIV84, RSV, ESV, GW, REB, NASB, NET, NLT96, JBP, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>They refer only to humanity. This interpretation is implied by English versions that use plural or collective forms. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What are human beings that you are mindful of them, or mortals, that you care for them? (NRSV) <em>(NIV, GNT, CEV, NRSV, NJB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). The author of Hebrews often used verses from the OT as evidence that Jesus is the Messiah. A number of commentaries, including recent ones, also support this interpretation.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is a growing number of scholars supporting the Messianic tones of Hebrews 2:6–8: Koester (page 221) says, “A tension in the psalm enables it to bear two different lines of interpretation…. The psalm asks about God’s will for ‘man,’ which can be understood as a question about humankind generally so that Hebrews can deal with God’s design for people…. The psalm can also be taken as a statement about Jesus, who is God’s Son and heir of all things.” Lane (47) says that when the author of Hebrews quotes the statement in Psalm 8 “You put everything in subjection under his feet” (verse 8a), he “immediately adds, we do not yet…see everything subject to his control.” Lane sees this “not yet” as crucial, “for it indicates that the writer found in the quotation a prophecy that will eventually be fulfilled.” He continues (page 48) to explain that since the psalmist recognized that this prophecy has not yet been fulfilled, the author of Hebrews sees “that the promised subjection has reference not to humankind in general (verse 8), but to Jesus (verse 9), whom God has appointed ‘heir of everything.” See also O’Brien (pages 91–93) and Attridge (page 72). For a detailed article on this topic see Guthrie and Quinn (2006: pages 235–246).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may not be possible to use a singular form to refer to human beings in general. If this is true in your language, you may want to include a footnote in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Some scholars believe that “son of man” is used in the psalm to refer to humans in general. However, the author of Hebrews also used it to refer to Jesus as the Messiah who “leads many sons to glory” (2:10). Jesus is the one who fulfilled the psalm’s prophecy that God put all things under mankind’s control.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">It is clear that in the OT the psalmist is praising God for choosing “human beings” to rule over creation. However, the author of Hebrews does not have <u>only</u> humanity in mind. He also uses the psalm to refer to the Messiah. He implies that the psalmist also spoke about Jesus becoming human and being crowned with glory and honor.</p></div><h4>2:9</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek text this verse is one long sentence. It may be more natural in some languages to use more than one sentence to translate the verse.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The clauses in the Greek text are in a slightly different order from most English versions.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In Greek the verse is more literally: <sup>9b</sup>But for a short time, lowered more than angels, <sup>9a</sup>we see Jesus <sup>9d</sup>because he suffered death, <sup>9c</sup>crowned with glory and honor, <sup>9e</sup>in order that by the grace of God he might taste death on behalf of each person.</span></span> In some languages it is more natural to follow the order of the English versions and begin with the clause “we see Jesus.” See the General Comment on 2:9a–e at the end of 2:9e for examples.</p><h4>2:9a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But we see Jesus,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>However/Yet we<sup>(incl)</sup> see Jesus.</p></li><li><p>But as for Jesus,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But we see Jesus:</strong> The clause <em>But we see Jesus</em> introduces a contrast between what we saw in the past and what we see now that Jesus has come. In the past, people did not see that everything was subject to them. But now in the present time, people understand that Jesus fulfilled what the writer of Psalm 8 predicted.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to introduce the contrast are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But what do we see also/now? Jesus became for some time lower than angels, but now…<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Compare the rendering of Parole de Vie.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But we know that this was fulfilled because of Jesus. Because he is the one who was made a little lower than the angels when he became a person. However, we see that Jesus was…<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But what really happened was this: For a little while Jesus also was made more humble/unimportant than the angels…<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Tagbanwa back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this contrast in a natural way in your language. See the next note and also the General Comment on 2:9a–e at the end of 2:9e for examples of other ways to translate it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Jesus:</strong> Here the author used the name <em>Jesus</em> for the first time in Hebrews. In chapter 1 he referred to him as the “Son” of God (for, example, 1:2) and God’s “firstborn” (1:6).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Here in chapter 2, the author calls him <em>Jesus</em> (2:9), “author” (2:10) and “high priest” (2:17).</span></span></p><h4>2:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who was made a little lower than the angels,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For a short time, he was given less status/authority than the angels,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> gave him a lower position than the angels for a while.</p></li></ul></div><h4>2:9b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who was made a little lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor:</strong> The phrases <em>was made a little lower than the angels</em> and <em>crowned with glory and honor</em> were taken from the OT quotation given in 2:7a. You may want to use quotation marks or bold italics to indicate that these phrases are quotations. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He was made <strong><em>a little lower than the angels</em></strong> but he is now <strong><em>crowned with glory and honor</em></strong></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">For the phrase <em>a little</em>, be sure to follow the same interpretation as you followed in 2:7. For more information, see the notes there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>was made a little lower:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>was made a little lower</em> is passive. The context indicates that God is the one who made Jesus lower than the angels so that he could die on behalf of all people. In some languages a passive verb may not be natural here or may imply a wrong meaning. If that is true in your language, you may indicate God as the subject or cause of the action. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God caused Jesus’ respect/glory to become a little less than the angels’ respect/glory</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God caused Jesus to be a little smaller <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in status</span> than the angels</p></blockquote><h4>2:9c–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>now crowned with glory and honor because He suffered death:</strong> The clause <em>because He suffered death</em> gives the reason why Jesus was crowned with glory and honor. Jesus suffered death (2:9d), and that is why God crowned him with glory and honor (2:9c).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to change the order of 2:9c and 2:9d so that the reason comes before the result. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>9d</sup>Jesus suffered death. <sup>9c</sup>That is why he is now crowned with glory and honor.</p></blockquote><h4>2:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>now crowned with glory and honor</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">but</span> now he has been given greatness and honor <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as king</span>,</p></li><li><p>Yet now <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has greatly honored/exalted him</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>now crowned with glory and honor:</strong> Here the author used the phrase that applied to people in 2:7b to refer to Jesus. The verb <em>crowned</em> is used in a figurative way. It refers to the custom of honoring someone by placing a wreath (“crown”) of leaves on his head.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Among Greek people this custom was used to honor the winner of a race or other competition.</span></span> Here the figure of speech indicates that God honored Jesus by giving him great authority and respect. Some other ways to translate this metaphor are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he has been made big and given an honored position/seat<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God has honored him like the honor of a king<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>glory and honor:</strong> See the note on <em>glory and honor</em> in 2:7b. In this context the phrase refers to the glory and honor that God gave Jesus. In some languages it is helpful to make the translation more emphatic here than in 2:7. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God caused that…Jesus Christ is supremely respected.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><h4>2:9d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because He suffered death,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because he suffered/experienced death.</p></li><li><p>because of the death that he died.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He suffered death:</strong> The phrase <em>He suffered death</em> means that Jesus experienced death. The word <em>suffered</em> refers to his death. It does not refer here to the pain that he suffered during the process of dying. Some other ways to translate the phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he suffered by dying</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he died</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he experienced death</p></blockquote><h4>2:9e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It was because of God’s grace/kindness that Jesus died on behalf of all people.</p></li><li><p>Because God was very merciful, he caused Jesus to die as a substitute for all <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other</span> people.</p></li><li><p>God showed his great kindness/love by letting Jesus die for everyone else.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that…He might taste death for everyone:</strong> This clause tells the purpose for Jesus’ death (2:9d). The word <em>might</em> helps to indicate that it was God’s purpose for Jesus to die. It does not indicate any doubt about the fact that Jesus died. God decided that Jesus should die so that everyone else would not have to die. Jesus died as a substitute for every other person. Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to die for everyone</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in order that his death would replace the death of every person</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that he would die substituting for mankind<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Yakan back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>taste death:</strong> The phrase <em>taste death</em> is a figure of speech. It means “die.” It does not indicate that Jesus just seemed to die. When Jesus died, he was truly dead, and he remained dead until his resurrection.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In many languages, it will give a wrong meaning to translate this idiom literally. If that is true in your language, you can use the normal way in your language to say that he died. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>died (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>experience death (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, if you have a different idiom in your language that means “died,” you may be able to use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for everyone:</strong> The phrase <em>for everyone</em> indicates here that Jesus was a substitute for all human beings. If Jesus had not died, every other person would have to die as punishment for his or her own sins. Some other ways to translate this meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to be the substitute/redemption for all mankind.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that everyone else <span data-bnType=\"implied\">could be spared/saved</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>on behalf of everyone (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages there may be a figure of speech to express this meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by the grace of God:</strong> The phrase <em>by the grace of God</em> means “as the result of God’s grace” or “because of God’s grace.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some church fathers and a few Greek manuscripts have “apart from God” instead of “by the grace of God,” which would result in the meaning “Jesus tasted death apart from God.” However, Metzger (Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament, 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition, page 594) gives the reading “by the grace of God” an A rating, indicating that “the text is certain” (page 14).</span></span> It indicates that the reason that Christ died on behalf of people was because God was very gracious to people. Because God is so gracious and kind, he caused Jesus to die for all people. It was not because the people deserved his kindness.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate <em>by the grace of God</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>through the greatness of God’s mercy</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because of God’s wonderful kindness (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages there is a figurative way to translate this meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because of the whiteness/bigness of God’s heart</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>grace of God:</strong> The phrase <em>grace of God</em> refers here to the kindness that God freely shows to people because he is good and generous. It implies that the people have not done anything to deserve his kindness. Some other ways to translate the phrase <em>grace of God</em> in this context are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God is kind/generous</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s merciful goodness</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>grace</em> also occurs in 4:16, 10:29, 12:15, and 13:9.

He did it so that people may share God’s glory and become part of God’s family. This paragraph is still part of the section which establishes that Jesus is greater than the angels. It implies that no angel provided salvation for us like Jesus did by suffering and dying for us.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some versions do not begin a new paragraph until 2:11. That is because 2:10 is a verse that links Paragraph 2:5–9 with this new paragraph.</p></div><h4>2:10</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse gives an explanation for 2:9e. It explains why it was fitting for God to cause Jesus to suffer and die in order to be the perfect Savior for mankind. In the Greek text, this explanation is introduced by a conjunction that is often translated as “for” or “because.” Some English versions begin 2:10 with such a conjunction, and others do not. Connect the explanation to 2:9e in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is more natural to change the order of clauses in this verse. For examples, see the General Comment on 2:10a–d at the end of 2:10d.</p><h4>2:10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>In bringing many sons to glory,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ As he brings/takes <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his</span> many sons/children to splendor/greatness,</p></li><li><p>¶ Since God was leading many sons and daughters to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">share</span> his great honor,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>In bringing many sons to glory:</strong> The phrase <em>In bringing many sons to glory</em> means “as part of the process of bringing many sons to glory.” There are two views about who is <em>bringing many sons to glory</em> in this verse:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>God is bringing them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>while God was bringing many sons and daughters to glory (GW) <em>(BSB, NRSV, NIV, GNT, NET, REB, NCV, GW, ESV, NASB, JBP, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Jesus is bringing them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as Jesus led many of God’s children to be saved and to share in his glory (CEV) <em>(CEV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), as most English versions and commentaries do.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Ellingworth (page 159) says, “Grammatically, <em>agagónta</em> may refer either to God or to Christ, but in the context, a great majority of commentators find it more natural to make it refer to God, first because it is anarthrous, and secondly because of the presence of <em>autōn</em>, which would be superfluous if Christ were meant….”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>bringing many sons to glory:</strong> In this context the phrase <em>bringing many sons to glory</em> indicates that God causes his many people to have the glory that is mentioned in 2:7b and 2:9c. You should translate <em>glory</em> in a similar way as you did there. The text does not specify here how God brings his children to glory.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>many sons</em> implies that God has many people. It does not imply a contrast with “all.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate <em>bringing many sons to glory</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>while God was bringing many sons and daughters to glory (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God did that so that many would be his children whom he would call to heaven to share in his greatness.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>many sons:</strong> The word <em>sons</em> refers here to children of (or for) God. It includes both males and females, as it often does in the NT. It also includes people of all ages. It does not refer only to children. Another way to translate the phrase is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>many sons and daughters (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In this context the word <em>many</em> contrasts with the <u>one</u> God. However, in some languages a phrase like <em>many sons</em> may imply that God did not bring all of his children to glory. (It may imply that he brought only some of them.) If that is true in your language, you should translate in a different way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his many children (NLT96)</p></blockquote><h4>2:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>it was fitting for</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>it was right/proper for</p></li><li><p>the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">decision to do that</span> was fitting/appropriate for</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it was fitting for:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>it was fitting for</em> means “It was appropriate/right that…” It was right and proper for God to cause Jesus to suffer and die in order to become the perfect savior for people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the phrase <em>it was fitting</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It was right/proper</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This decision…is very appropriate<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So what <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> did was fitting</p></blockquote><h4>2:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>God, for whom and through whom all things exist,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to do that</span>. God created everything and causes it all to exist for himself.</p></li><li><p>God, because he made everything and it exists for his pleasure/will.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God, for whom and through whom all things exist:</strong> The BSB has supplied the word <em>God</em> here. It is not in the Greek text. The phrase <em>for whom and through whom all things exist</em> describes God. The phrase <em>for whom</em> indicates that everything exists to give God honor, pleasure, or benefit. The phrase <em>through whom</em> indicates that God is the one who caused all things to exist. They exist because he created them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In many languages it may be more natural to translate the long description of God as a separate sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God is the One who made all things, and all things are for his glory. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God is the one who created everything and everything was created in order that he would be praised/honored<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>all things:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>all things</em> refers to everything that God created. See how you translated this word in 1:2, 1:3, and 2:8.</p><h4>2:10d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:10d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It was right that he caused Jesus</span> to become completely equipped to save them and lead them to salvation through what he suffered.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">/It was right that</span> he used the suffering<span data-bnType=\"implied\">/death</span> that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">endured</span> to fully prepare Jesus to save them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering:</strong> This part of the verse indicates that God made Jesus perfectly able to lead people to salvation through what Jesus suffered. It does not imply that Jesus was sinful or less than morally perfect.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>the author of their salvation</em> refers to Jesus. Be sure that the reference to him is clear in your language. In some languages it may be necessary to repeat the name Jesus. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Exactly correct then was his plan to make Jesus our proper…leader through the hardship he endured because Jesus is the one who leads us in our being saved.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>make…perfect:</strong> The verb phrase <em>make…perfect</em> means “make complete.” In this context it implies that Jesus became fully equipped to lead people to salvation. It does not imply that Jesus was sinful and needed to suffer in order to become morally perfect. The word <em>perfect</em> refers here to becoming completely ready to be our leader and savior. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God made him a perfect leader (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the author of their salvation:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>author</em> refers to a strong leader who saves his people from their enemies. As the pioneer/leader, Jesus saves his people from the devil and from sin and death. He leads them to God to share in his glory. The author of Hebrews also used this title for Jesus in 12:2.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The only other occurrences of <em>archēgos</em> are in Acts 3:15 and Acts 5:31, both referring to the Lord Jesus.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate <em>the author of their salvation</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the leader who saves them</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the one who made a way for them to be saved</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>through suffering:</strong> The phrase <em>through suffering</em> indicates the way that Jesus became a perfect leader. Because of the sufferings that Jesus endured, especially the sufferings of bearing people’s sins on the cross and of enduring temptation, he became the perfect leader for God’s people. Some other ways to translate the meaning in this context are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>from the things that Jesus suffered, he became a Redeemer who has no lack</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>through/in the torment that Jesus endured, he became completely able to be the Savior of his people</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:10a–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be helpful to reorder 2:10. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10c</sup>God created/made everything for himself, and he is the one who is <sup>10a</sup>bringing/leading many children to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">share in his own</span> glory/presence. <sup>10b</sup>So it was right/necessary that <sup>10d</sup>he made Jesus to be the perfect leader who saves them through what he suffered.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10c</sup>God is the one who made everything for himself. <sup>10a</sup>And since <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he wanted to</span> bring many children to share his glory, <sup>10b</sup>it was right that <sup>10d</sup>he should make Jesus the perfect leader who would save them by what he suffered.</p></blockquote></div>",

In some languages it may be necessary to make that explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jesus who is making us into the holy people of God and we whom he is making holy<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><h4>2:11a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:11a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For both the One who sanctifies</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Indeed, both the one who makes people holy</p></li><li><p>Both Jesus, who dedicates people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>For</em> introduces another reason why it was fitting for God to cause Jesus to suffer in order to bring many people to glory. Some English versions, such as the NIV, imply this connection without using a conjunction. Show the connection in the way that is most natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>sanctifies:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>sanctifies</em> means “makes holy.” It refers here to dedicating people to God so that they become God’s people and are purified from their sins. Some other ways to translate <em>sanctifies</em> in this context are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for he who consecrates (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who makes people holy (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the one who dedicates people to God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">For more information, see <u>holy, sense B1</u>, in KBT.</p><h4>2:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and those who are sanctified are of the same family.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and those who are being made holy <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all</span> have the same Father, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span>.</p></li><li><p>and those people whom Jesus dedicates <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span> are all from/of the same family.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and those who are sanctified:</strong> The phrase <em>those who are sanctified</em> refers to the people whom Jesus is making holy. In this context it refers to the same people as the “many children” who are saved by Jesus (2:10a).</p><p data-indent=\"3\">The verb <em>are sanctified</em> is the passive form of the verb that was translated as “sanctifies” in 2:11a. In some languages it is more natural to use an active form here and indicate Jesus as the subject. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>and the people whom he sanctifies</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>and we whom he purifies from our sins</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>and the people whom he dedicates <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>are of the same family:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>of the same family</em> is more literally “all from one.” There are two ways to interpret the word <em>same</em> here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to one Father (God). God is the father of Jesus and all people whom Jesus sanctifies.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Greek has two similar sounding participles here—<em>hagiazōn</em>, literally, “the-holy-maker” or, “the-one-making-holy” and <em>hagiazomenoi</em> the “holy-made-ones.”</span></span> They are part of the same family. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>are all from one Father (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>all have one Father (NRSV) <em>(BSB, NRSV, GNT, NIV, GW, NLT, NASB, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to one humanity or origin. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>share a common humanity (JBP) <em>This interpretation is also translated in various other ways, such as “origin” or “source.”</em> <em>(RSV, ESV, REB, NJB, JBP, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Both interpretations are true. Jesus and the people whom he sanctifies are all children of God, and Jesus has also become like them in sharing their humanity. However, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). It fits the immediate context of “bringing many children to glory,” and it has good commentary support.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example, Lane says, “The contextual references to God in verse 10 and to the family relationship in verse 11…tend to support the contention that <em>`enos</em> is masculine and has reference to God (GNT ‘all have the same Father,’ NIV ‘are of the same family’). Both the Son and those who are sons share a common familial relationship that is rooted in the gracious determination of God to bring his children to their destiny through the redemptive mission of the Son…” (WBC, Volume 47A, page 58)</span></span></p><h4>2:11c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:11c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>That is why Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters. (GW)</p></li><li><p>Therefore Jesus willingly/gladly says that they are his siblings.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>So</em> introduces the result of 2:11a–b. Because Jesus and the people whom he sanctifies have the same father (2:11b), Jesus is not ashamed to call them his brothers (2:11c). Some other ways to introduce this result are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>That is why (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For this reason (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And because of this</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers:</strong> This clause indicates that Jesus <em>is not ashamed</em> to say that he is in the same family with the people whom he sanctifies. The context implies that although Jesus is perfectly holy and much greater than human beings, he accepts people as his brothers and sisters because he and they all have God as their father. Some other ways to translate the clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jesus is not ashamed to say that we are his relatives.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jesus is not ashamed of us but rather he calls us his younger siblings.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Different cultures have different beliefs about shame. In some cultures the negative statement <em>Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers</em> may imply a wrong meaning.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In the Jewish culture, either God or people could consider a person or the person’s actions to deserve shame. People tried to avoid being shamed, but often people unjustly shamed someone. Koester (page 230) says, “The desire to gain honor…and to avoid shame for oneself and one’s family was an important factor in shaping behavior…. Honor and shame could be ascribed to a person by society or by God, and many recognized that public opinion was an unreliable measure of a person’s worth. Therefore, Jewish and philosophical sources exhorted people not to be ashamed of doing justice and speaking the truth even if society regarded these as disgraceful. Those addressed by Hebrews were viewed with contempt by society (Heb 10:32–34, 13:13–14), BUT Christ was not ashamed to identify with them, just as God was not ashamed to identify with Abraham and his family, who spent their lives as foreigners….”</span></span> If that is true in your language, you may translate the meaning without a negative. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Jesus is glad to call them his brothers and sisters</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Jesus considers it right/proper to call them his brothers and sisters</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to call them brothers:</strong> In this context the phrase <em>to call them brothers</em> means to accept or acknowledge them as his siblings. The author of Hebrews was a believer in Christ, and he was writing to other believers. In some languages it may be more natural to use a form that refers to both the author and his readers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to say/acknowledge that we<sup>(incl)</sup> are siblings</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>brothers:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>brothers</em> includes both males and females. In some languages it is necessary to use different words for males and females. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>brothers and sisters (NRSV)</p></blockquote>",

He did it so that people may share God’s glory and become part of God’s family. This paragraph is still part of the section which establishes that Jesus is greater than the angels. It implies that no angel provided salvation for us like Jesus did by suffering and dying for us.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some versions do not begin a new paragraph until 2:11. That is because 2:10 is a verse that links Paragraph 2:5–9 with this new paragraph.</p></div><h4>2:12–13</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:12–13 the author of Hebrews quotes four statements from the OT. He indicates that these quotations were statements that Jesus said to God or about God. The quotations support what the author said about Jesus not being ashamed to call us his relatives (“brothers and sisters”). He is not ashamed to become human like us and suffer as a human being.</p><h4>2:12</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse is a quotation from Psalm 22:22. Psalm 22 is called a “messianic psalm” because it tells about the Messiah whom God promised to send to save people. The author of Hebrews quotes words that the Messiah spoke in the psalm. He indicates that Jesus spoke these words to God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Verse 12 has two parallel poetic lines. In some languages it may be more natural to combine the two parts of the quotation into one sentence or to change the order of the parts. See the General Comment on 2:12a–b at the end of 2:12b for an example.</p><h4>2:12a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:12a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He says: “I will proclaim Your name to My brothers;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He says, “I will tell my brothers and sisters about your<sup>(sing)</sup> name/character.</p></li><li><p>He says, “I will tell my siblings about you<sup>(sing)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and the great/glorious things that you have done.</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He says:</strong> The words <em>He says</em> introduces another quotation from the OT. In the quotation, Jesus spoke to God. In many languages it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here and introduce the quotation in a fuller way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He says to God (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For he said to God (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will proclaim Your name to My brothers:</strong> This statement is a quotation from Psalm 22. The author of Hebrews quotes it as a poetic way to say that Jesus will tell people about God. He will tell them about God’s character and about what he has done.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will tell my people what you have done (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will make your fame known to my brothers (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Then, I will tell my fellow Israelites about you (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to My brothers:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>to My brothers</em> includes both male and female siblings here, as it usually does in the New Testament.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In this quotation Jesus referred to believers as his <em>brothers</em> to indicate that they are part of God’s family with him. They are God’s sons and daughters. The word <em>brothers</em> does not refer here to members of Jesus’ physical family while he was on earth.</p><h4>2:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I will sing Your praises in the assembly.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>When I meet with <span data-bnType=\"implied\">your</span><sup>(sing)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span>, I will praise you with songs.”</p></li><li><p>I will sing praises/songs to you<sup>(sing)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when I am</span> in the gathering <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of your people</span>.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will sing Your praises:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>I will sing Your praises</em> is more literally “I will sing praise/hymns to you.” It has a similar meaning to “I will proclaim your name” in 2:12a. It means that Jesus will sing praise to God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will praise you with songs/hymns.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Your:</strong> As in 2:12a, <em>Your</em> refers to God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the assembly:</strong> The phrase <em>in the assembly</em> is parallel to the phrase “to my brothers” in 2:12a. The word <em>in</em> means “among” or “in the presence of.” The word <em>assembly</em> refers to the group of God’s people who are meeting together. Some other ways to translate <em>in the assembly</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in their meeting (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>among all your people (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when they come together (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>assembly:</strong> The Greek word which the BSB translates as <em>assembly</em> refers to a group of people who are meeting together. In the New Testament the word is often translated as “church.” In the OT, which is quoted here, it was used for the whole Israelite community. See <u>church, other uses</u> in KBT.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:12a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The two statements in 2:12 have similar (parallel) meanings. The parallel phrases are indicated here with underlining or italics (the order has been adjusted to match the Greek):</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12a</sup> <u>I will proclaim your name</u> <em>to my brothers</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12b</sup> <em>in the assembly</em> <u>I will sing your praises</u>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice that in Greek, the order of the similar phrases are reversed in 2:12b. This makes the phrase a chiasm, which emphasizes that Jesus claims us as his brothers and sisters. In some languages this order may not have that meaning, and it may be confusing. If that is true in your language, you may need to express this emphasis in a different way. For example, in some languages it may be more emphatic to begin the two clauses with this part of the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>To my brothers, I will declare your name. In the presence of the congregation, I will praise you.</p></blockquote></div>",

I am here with <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> children whom he has given me.”</p></li></ul></div><h4>2:13a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In this verse the author quoted two more OT verses which he applied to Jesus. These quotations come from Isaiah 8:17–18.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And again:</strong> The phrase <em>And again</em> introduces another quotation from the OT. The author implied that Jesus said this about God. Introduce the quotation in a natural way in your language. Some ways to do this in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He also says, “I… (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Something else he caused-to-be-written says, “I…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is helpful to use your usual key term for the Scriptures here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and in another place in God’s book/writings he said</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>“I will put My trust in Him.” And once again: “Here am I, and the children God has given Me.”:</strong> The phrase <em>And once again</em> connects two statements that are one clause in Isaiah.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The original clauses from Isaiah 8:18 did not have this connecting phrase.</span></span> It emphasizes the connection between Jesus and the <em>children</em> (people). The pronoun <em>I</em> is emphatic. It implies that Jesus is the leader of his people, and they must put their trust in God, along with Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to connect these clauses are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>“I will put my trust in him,” that is, “I and the children God has given me.” (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>“I trust God,” and he said moreover, “Here I am joined with the children of God that he has entrusted to me.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He also said, “I put my hope in him,” and “I with the children whom God has given me.”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a natural way in your language to translate the emphatic connection between Jesus and his people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I will put My trust in Him:</strong> The clause <em>I will put My trust in Him</em> indicates that Jesus is determined to trust in God only. It does not imply that Jesus was beginning to trust in God at the moment when he said this. He also trusted God before he said it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will keep my trust fixed on him. (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>As for me, I have confidence only in God.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The context implies that Jesus trusts in God as the leader of all who follow him. Jesus trusts in God, and everyone who follows him must also trust God. In some languages it is helpful to make this clear in the introduction to the quotation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">As our leader,</span> he also says “I will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">live by</span> trusting in God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Here am I:</strong> The phrase <em>Here am I</em> is more literally “See/Look, I.” In this context it is a way for the speaker (Jesus) to focus the readers’ attention on himself. It also emphasizes the next statement. He emphasizes the connection between him and the people who follow him. Use a natural way in your language to focus attention on Jesus and his people here.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Greek text of the quotation begins with the word <em>idou</em>, “look/see” and the KJV and NASB have translated the whole phrase as “Behold I and the children…” The implication of the word “Behold” is to draw attention to the words following, and so modern versions have rendered the phrase “Here am I….”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and the children God has given Me:</strong> The phrase <em>the children God has given Me</em> refers to all people who believe in Jesus and follow him.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There are two ways to interpret this phrase:(1) It refers to <strong>God’s</strong> children, whom Jesus leads to salvation as their brother.(2) It refers to <strong>Jesus’</strong> “children.” (The term “children” is used in a spiritual sense, referring to the people whom God gave him as his followers.)Most English versions can be interpreted either way. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). It fits the context and is followed by many commentaries. An Exegetical Summary of Hebrews (page 72) lists ten commentators that follow this interpretation.</span></span> Jesus and the people he saves are brothers and sisters. They are part of God’s family and therefore God’s children.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this quotation are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Here I am, accompanied by God’s children whom he has given me.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Here I am, joined with the children of God that he has entrusted to me.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>given:</strong> Here the word <em>given</em> indicates that God gave Jesus responsibility for those who have become God’s children.

He came to defeat the devil, and stop people from being afraid to die. He also became human so that he could become the high priest for his people. In these ways, he is greater than the angels, because none of them was able to become human, defeat the devil, and free his people from fearing death.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author briefly introduces the topic of Jesus as our high priest, which he will discuss more fully in 4:14–5:10 and 7:1–8:1.</p></div><h4>2:14–15</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek, 2:14–15 is one long sentence. In many languages it is more natural to break it into two or three sentences. For examples of how this can be translated as three sentences, see the General Comment on 2:14–15 at the end of 2:15.</p><h4>2:14a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:14a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Now since the children have flesh and blood,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ So, because these children are human beings,</p></li><li><p>¶ Because, therefore, these children <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of God</span> have human bodies,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Now since:</strong> This verse begins with the two Greek conjunctions that the BSB translates as <em>Now since</em> The word translated as <em>Now</em> is usually translated as “therefore” and introduces the connection between this paragraph and the OT quotations in 2:12–13. The word <em>since</em> indicates the connection between 2:14a and 2:14b. It is important to consider each of these connections and how to translate them in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the connections are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><strong>So then, because</strong> the children…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The children have flesh and blood, <strong>so/therefore</strong></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions leave the connection with the previous paragraph implicit and translate only the connection between the clauses (2:14a and 2:14b). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Since all of these sons and daughters…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the children have flesh and blood:</strong> The clause <em>the children have flesh and blood</em> means that God’s children are human beings. The phrase <em>flesh and blood</em> refers to being human, and it implies the weakness of human beings. Some ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those children being referred to are people/humans</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>these children are people with physical bodies (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the children of God that it is talking about here are people who have bodies that die<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the children:</strong> The phrase <em>the children</em> repeats the phrase from the quotation in 2:13b. It refers to the children of God, whom Jesus said were his “brothers and sisters” in 2:12a. Indicate clearly that the author referred back to the same children that he mentioned in 2:13b. Some ways to do this in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>these children (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s children (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Refer back to them in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>flesh and blood:</strong> The Greek phrase <em>flesh and blood</em> is literally “blood and flesh.” It is an idiom that usually refers to human bodies. It indicates that the children of God he referred to here are human beings. Use the natural way in your language to refer to humans.</p><h4>2:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He too shared in their humanity,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>he also became a human being like them,</p></li><li><p>Jesus also has/received a human body like they have.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He too shared in their humanity:</strong> The clause <em>He too shared in their humanity</em> means that Jesus also had “flesh and blood.” It indicates that he became a human being and had a human body like the children of God whom he was leading to salvation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he also became a human being, (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Jesus himself became like them and shared their human nature.

The Translator’s Handbook (Ellingworth and Nida, page 46) points out that the GeCL interprets the clause that begins with this conjunction as the result of Jesus’ death, instead of the purpose, saying, “This is possible and produces a clear translation: ‘In this way he has freed men who had been slaves….’”</span></span> The clause indicates that when Christ died, he defeated the devil and took away the devil’s power of death.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A similar idea is expressed in 1 Corinthians 15:26.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to make 2:14c–d a separate sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He/Jesus did this</span> so that by dying himself, he might destroy the devil who has power over death.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>He might destroy:</strong> In this context the verb <em>destroy</em> means “to make powerless.” The phrase <em>He might destroy</em> indicates that Jesus’ purpose in dying was to take away the devil’s power. The context indicates that by dying Jesus was successful in destroying the devil’s power. The word <em>might</em> does not imply any doubt about that.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate <em>He might destroy</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in order that he would spoil the power of<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to completely take away the power of</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he would totally defeat<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>him who holds the power of death, that is, the devil:</strong> Scholars have different views about what the <em>power of death</em> refers to here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It indicates that the devil has power to tempt people to sin, which causes spiritual death (separation from God). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who works to cause <span data-bnType=\"implied\">spiritual</span> death</p></blockquote></li><li><p>It indicates that the devil brought sin and death into the world. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Satan, who is the origin of death<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Western Bukidnon Manobo back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to the power that the devil has to cause people’s physical death.

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) or (2). These interpretations fit the context of Hebrews and are supported by various Bible scholars.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Ellis Diebler (<em>SSA of Hebrews</em>, page 2) gives the meaning as “the one who has the power to cause people to die spiritually.” He continues, “In the phrase ‘the one having the power of death’ it is difficult to determine just what the genitive phrase means…. It seems best to say that the writer refers to the fall of mankind in Genesis 3, at which time Satan gained the power to cause Adam and his descendants to die—which here refers to eternal death (separation from God), so Kistemaker.” Kistemaker says, “Satan…the murderer from the beginning…desired man’s death in the fullest sense of the word: physical death and spiritual death (separation from God).” Westcott (page 53) says, “The devil, as the author of sin, has the power over death…not as though he could inflict it at his pleasure, but death is his realm: he makes it subservient to his end.”</span></span> Interpretation (3) is not recommended, because the Scriptures indicate that God is the one who has power to decide when a person will die.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate interpretation (1) or (2) are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his control over people, that being what leads them to death which is unending punishment<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Tagbanwa back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the devil’s power that causes people to die <span data-bnType=\"implied\">eternally</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the devil:</strong> The phrase <em>the devil</em> refers to the chief of all evil spirits. His name is Satan. In Hebrew this name means “enemy.” He is the enemy of God and God’s people. The terms <em>the devil</em> and “Satan” refer to the same spiritual enemy. In some languages, you may want to use one term for both terms in your translation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate <em>the devil</em>:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a local name or idiom that refers to the chief of all demons.</p></li><li><p>Use a descriptive phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the leader of the evil spirits</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the spirit enemy of God</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Transliterate the name “Satan.” If this word is not already known in your area, you may also want to add a descriptive phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Satan, the ruler of demons <em>If you transliterate “Satan” or borrow a word from another language, be sure that it communicates the biblical meaning to people in your culture. It is important to check this in each biblical context.</em></p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Try to use a term that is acceptable to churches in the area. It is suggested that you also add a footnote or glossary entry that further explains who the devil is. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The devil is the leader of all the evil spirits or demons. Once he was an angel in heaven, but he rebelled against God. God expelled him from heaven, and now he tempts people on earth. Other names for him in the Bible are “Beelzebul,” “Satan,” “the Evil One,” “the Enemy,” and “the Tempter.”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you have translated the Gospels, you may use the same term as you used there.

He came to defeat the devil, and stop people from being afraid to die. He also became human so that he could become the high priest for his people. In these ways, he is greater than the angels, because none of them was able to become human, defeat the devil, and free his people from fearing death.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author briefly introduces the topic of Jesus as our high priest, which he will discuss more fully in 4:14–5:10 and 7:1–8:1.</p></div><h4>2:15a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:15a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and free those who all their lives were held in slavery</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Then he would release those <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> who were <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> slaves as long as they lived,</p></li><li><p>Jesus also died to rescue all of us<sup>(incl)</sup> who live each day</p></li></ul></div><h4>2:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>by their fear of death.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because they were afraid to die.</p></li><li><p>in fear of dying.</p></li></ul></div><h4>2:15</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and free those who…were held in slavery by their fear of death:</strong> This clause tells the second purpose that Jesus had in becoming a human being (2:14b) and dying (2:14c). Jesus became human and died in order to set people free from the fear of death.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The verb <em>free</em> and the phrase <em>held in slavery by</em> are metaphors. The author used them to compare what Jesus did to the way someone rescues people from slavery. People were living like slaves because they were always afraid to die. After Jesus died for them (and came alive again), the people became <em>free</em> from fearing death. They did not have to be afraid to die anymore.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this meaning are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the metaphors. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Only in this way could he set free all who have lived their lives as slaves to the fear of dying. (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a simile and make the comparison more explicit.

In some languages it may be more natural to change the order of these phrases so that the reason comes before the result.

The word <em>For</em> introduces the reason why Jesus became a human being, rather than an angel. He became human because human beings are the ones whom he came to earth to help. He did not come to earth to help angels. Use a natural way in your language to indicate that 2:16 is the explanation for the statement in 2:14–15.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>surely:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>surely</em> only occurs here in the NT. It introduces a fact that is obviously true. Some other ways to translate it here are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>clearly/certainly</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We…know that (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Of course<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Tagbanwa back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it is not the angels He helps, but the descendants of Abraham:</strong> In Greek this clause first tells what Jesus did not do, and then it tells what he did do. In some languages it may be more natural to change this order. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jesus helps Abraham’s descendants rather than helping angels. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here the author compared angels and humans (<em>the descendants of Abraham</em>). Since Jesus became human, the author also implied a contrast between the angels and Jesus. That contrast is the theme of this division (1:5–2:18).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The author wanted to show that it was <u>people</u> whom Jesus came to earth to help. It was not angels whom he came to earth to help. He became a human being and shared human sorrows, sufferings, and joys. Then he died for humans so that he would be part of the same family with those who follow him. He did not do those things for angels.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this contrast are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So Jesus helps Abraham’s descendants rather than helping angels. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Clearly it is not the angels’ nature/life that he shares but rather he shares the nature/life of human beings, the descendants of Abraham.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate the contrast in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the angels:</strong> The word <em>angels</em> was also used in 1:4. Translate it in the same way as you did there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>He helps:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as the phrase <em>He helps</em> literally means “to take hold of.” In this context it means “to be concerned about, to help.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDAG, 2976 <em>epilambanomai</em>, Meaning 5. Bible Works 8.</span></span> Jesus came to earth to help human beings (the “descendants of Abraham”). Many English versions translate the word as “help” in this verse, as in the BSB.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Versions that translate in this way include the BSB, NIV, GNT, RSV, NCV, NET, REB, NASB, NLT, GW, and CEV. However, some scholars believe that the meaning here is “to become, to take on.” This meaning would imply here that Jesus took on human nature, not the nature of angels. This interpretation is also followed by a number of early church fathers. Westcott (page 55) says, “This sense is given, I believe, uniformly by the Fathers both Greek and Latin who understand the phrase of the fact and not of the purpose of the Incarnation.” However, he points out that the other interpretation [the meaning “be concerned with, help”] “is both more in accordance with the usage of the word and falls in perfectly with the argument.”</span></span> Another way to translate the meaning is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his <u>concern</u> is not for angels, but he <u>is concerned</u> for Abraham’s descendants (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the descendants of Abraham:</strong> The phrase <em>the descendants of Abraham</em> has both a literal and figurative meaning here. Literally, it refers to the Jews, the people of Israel. Abraham was their ancestor. However, in this verse the phrase also expresses two figurative meanings:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers generally to human beings in contrast to the angels.</p></li><li><p>It refers especially to people who have faith in God, as Abraham did.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is necessary to indicate in some way that the phrase has a figurative meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>us people who are counted/considered as Abraham’s descendants<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the people who follow the faith of Abraham<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The author of Hebrews and also the people who heard his message were among the descendants of Abraham. In some languages, you may need to make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>descendants of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">our</span><sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">ancestor</span> Abraham</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">us who are</span> Abraham’s <span data-bnType=\"implied\">spiritual</span> descendants<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>SSA of Hebrews, prepublication copy, page 27.</span></span></p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:16</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek this verse first tells what Jesus did not do, and then what he did do.

He came to defeat the devil, and stop people from being afraid to die. He also became human so that he could become the high priest for his people. In these ways, he is greater than the angels, because none of them was able to become human, defeat the devil, and free his people from fearing death.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author briefly introduces the topic of Jesus as our high priest, which he will discuss more fully in 4:14–5:10 and 7:1–8:1.</p></div><h4>2:17a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:17a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For this reason He had to be made like His brothers in every way,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>That is why it was necessary for him to become <span data-bnType=\"implied\">human</span> in every way like his brothers and sisters</p></li><li><p>Therefore, it was necessary for Jesus to become a real <span data-bnType=\"implied\">human being</span> like <span data-bnType=\"implied\">us</span><sup>(incl)</sup> his siblings.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For this reason:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>For this reason</em> introduces a conclusion from 2:16. This conclusion is also a summary and conclusion of 2:10–16. Some other ways to introduce this conclusion are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>That is why<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Therefore (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As a result</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Introduce it in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He had to be made like His brothers:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>had to</em> means “to be obligated”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span><em>ophelō</em> BDAG, (page 743), meaning 2, “to be under obligation to meet certain social or moral expectations, <em>owe</em>.” The use in Hebrews 2:17 is listed under sense <strong>ß</strong>. of this meaning, “one must, one ought.”</span></span> to do something. The clause means that Jesus was obligated to become human like other humans so that he would be a good high priest for them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it was necessary for him to be made…like his brothers and sisters (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he needed to become a man/human so that he could be the same as his siblings<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Tagbanwa back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The reason it was necessary for Him to become a human was so that He might become like us<sup>(incl)</sup> His siblings.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Western Bukidnon Manobo back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>be made like His brothers in every way:</strong> The phrase <em>be made like His brothers in every way</em> has a special meaning in this context. It indicates that in every way Jesus became a real human being, just as his brothers and sisters were human beings. However, the phrase <em>in every way</em> does not imply that Jesus was sinful like other human beings.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate <em>be made like His brothers in every way</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>become completely human like his people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to become a real human being like his fellow human beings</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to become just like any human being<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Ellingworth and Nida, <em>A Translator’s Handbook on the Letter to the Hebrews</em>, page 47, also on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His brothers:</strong> The phrase <em>His brothers</em> refers back to 2:11. There the author indicated that people whom Jesus sanctifies become his brothers and sisters. The author also implied that these brothers and sisters are the descendants of Abraham that he mentioned in 2:16. In many languages it is good to translate the phrase <em>His brothers</em> in the same way as you did in 2:11.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to add a phrase to indicate that <em>brothers</em> is used in a spiritual instead of a physical sense here, as it was in 2:11. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">us whom he calls</span> his own siblings<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Ellis Diebler, <em>SSA of Hebrews</em>, prepublication copy, page 27.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you include a pronoun like “us,” it should refer to both the author and the people who heard his message.</p><h4>2:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>in order to be a high priest who has compassion <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for his people</span> and who is trustworthy as he serves God</p></li><li><p>Because he did this, he can serve God as a high priest who acts mercifully <span data-bnType=\"implied\">toward us</span><sup>(incl)</sup>.

In 2:9 he used the name “Jesus.” In 2:10 he used the phrase “author of their salvation.” In this verse, he used the term “high priest.”</span></span> In Hebrews the author compared the work of a Jewish high priest in the Old Testament to what Jesus did for people. Jewish high priests represented the people and offered sacrifices to God on their behalf. Jesus also represented his people to God, and he offered himself as a perfect sacrifice so that God would forgive the people’s sins.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God:</strong> This clause tells the purpose for which Jesus became completely human (2:17a). He became human in order to be a good <em>high priest</em> for human beings. The words <em>merciful</em> and <em>faithful</em> both describe the phrase <em>high priest</em>. They do not indicate that Jesus was not merciful or faithful before he became human.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that he would be a high priest who treats people with compassion. He would also be faithful toward God and toward people as he does the work of the high priest.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Because he did that, when he does the work of the high priest, he sympathizes with the people. Both God and people can trust him.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a merciful…high priest:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>merciful</em> means “sympathetic, compassionate.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDAG, page 316.</span></span> It refers to a person who is concerned about the needs of other people and sympathizes with them. The phrase <em>a merciful…high priest</em> implies that as a human high priest, Jesus knows the temptations of human beings, and he has compassion for them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">See the examples in the preceding note for translation advice.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>faithful high priest in service to God:</strong> The word <em>faithful</em> means “worthy of trust, dependable.” It refers to someone who is worthy to be believed and trusted.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDAG, page 820.</span></span> The phrase <em>in service to God</em> indicates here that Jesus was faithful to both God and people as he served God as high priest. Both God and human beings could trust him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the phrase <em>faithful high priest in service to God</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a high priest who is…trustworthy as he represents us to God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to serve God as our high priest in a faithful way</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>high priest:</strong> The <em>high priest</em> was the leader of all the priests of the people of Israel. All the priests offered sacrifices on behalf of the people, but the high priest offered certain special sacrifices that no other priest could offer. Once a year, he offered the special sacrifice that atoned for the people’s sins. In a special way, he represented them to God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate <em>high priest</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the chief/leader of all the priests</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the main/principal priest</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the highest/leading priest</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The author described the work of Jesus as a high priest in more detail from 4:14 onwards. Translate the term <em>high priest</em> in the same way here and in the Gospels. For more information, see <u>priest</u> in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>in service to God:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>in service to God</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “toward God.” In this context it refers to service to God or to relationship with him. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in his service to God (GNT) <em>(BSB, GNT, NIV NRSV, ESV, CEV, REB, NCV, NLT, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “about God.” It refers to things concerning God or about God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>things relating to God (NET) <em>(NET, NASB, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), as most English versions and many commentators do. In this context <em>in service to God</em> refers to what the high priest did as he served God on behalf of the people. It refers especially to the sacrifice he made so that God would forgive the people’s sins (2:17c).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to represent us to God<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>working the work that God gave him<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as he served God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Be sure to connect this phrase to 2:17c in a natural way in your language.</p><h4>2:17c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:17c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in order to make atonement for the sins of the people.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to make atonement/expiation for their sins.</p></li><li><p>to offer sacrifice <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span> so that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will forgive people’s sins.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in order to make atonement for the sins of the people:</strong> This clause tells the purpose for Jesus being a merciful and faithful high priest. As a high priest like that, Jesus was able to make atonement for the people’s sins. He did this by offering himself to be killed as a sacrifice to God. Jesus himself took the punishment that people deserve for their sins so that God would forgive them. Then they themselves would not have to be killed.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this purpose are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in order to offer sacrifice so that the people’s sins would be forgiven</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so he would undergo the punishment of our sins so that it would thus be possible for our sins to be forgiven<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Then he could offer a sacrifice that would take away the sins of the people. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>make atonement:</strong> The phrase <em>make atonement</em> is one word in Greek. It refers to the way that people can obtain forgiveness from God for their sins.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Greek word that the BSB translates as “make atonement” only occurs here in the NT, and in Luke 8:13, where it means “be merciful” or “have pity on.” Here it means “make propitiation for.” The corresponding noun, <em>hilastērion</em>, occurs in Romans 3:25 (NIV: “sacrifice of atonement”) and in Hebrews 9:5, where it refers to the actual physical covering of the ark of the covenant. Another related noun, <em>hilasmos</em>, occurs in 1 John 2:2 and 4:10, and has the same meaning of “atoning sacrifice” (NIV) or “the sacrifice that takes our sins away.” (JB).These words are used in the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT) for the Hebrew verb <em>ḵap̄har</em>, “to cover” or “conceal,” and hence also to “atone for.” “The Day of atonement” is literally, “the Day of covering.” Sin against God must be dealt with, and the physical symbol of this was the lid which covered the wooden box in the most holy part of the Tabernacle. Once a year, the high priest sprinkled this with blood, showing that there had been a sacrifice to atone for the sins of the people.</span></span> In the Bible the word implies that people have sinned against God. God is just, and he must punish people for sin. Jesus offered himself as a sacrifice to be punished instead of other people so that God could forgive them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In many cultures people make sacrifices for other reasons that do not fit the meaning of the Greek word. It is often necessary to use a descriptive phrase to translate it. See the translation examples in the preceding note. Since the Greek word is a key biblical term, it is especially important to check the meaning of your translation of it with other speakers of your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other forms of this Greek word occur in 1 John 2:2 and 4:10. For more information, see <u>reconcile, sense B</u>, in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the sins of the people:</strong> The phrase <em>the sins of the people</em> refers to the sins which the people have committed. Some other ways to translate the phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the sins that the people have done</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the offenses that the people committed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">against God</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>sins:</strong> The word <em>sins</em> was used in 1:3d. You may translate it in the same way here. For more information, see the note on 1:3d.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the people:</strong> In the original context of the OT the word <em>people</em> refers to the same people as “the descendants of Abraham” in 2:16 and “his brothers” in 2:17a. Refer to them here in a natural way in your language.</p>",

He came to defeat the devil, and stop people from being afraid to die. He also became human so that he could become the high priest for his people. In these ways, he is greater than the angels, because none of them was able to become human, defeat the devil, and free his people from fearing death.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author briefly introduces the topic of Jesus as our high priest, which he will discuss more fully in 4:14–5:10 and 7:1–8:1.</p></div><h4>2:18</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Hebrews 2:18 is one sentence which has two clauses. Hebrews 2:18a tells why Christ is able to help us (the reason) and 2:18b tells about his helping (the result). In some languages, it is more natural to reorder these two clauses or to make them separate sentences. For examples of how this verse can be reordered or translated as two sentences, see the General Comment on 2:18a–b at the end of 2:18b.</p><h4>2:18a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:18a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Because He Himself suffered when He was tempted,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For because he also was tempted by the suffering he endured,</p></li><li><p>Since Jesus himself was tempted and suffered <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as a human being</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Because:</strong> In Greek this verse begins with two connectors that many English versions translate together as “For since.” The word that the BSB leaves implicit (“for”) explains more about why Jesus is a merciful and faithful high priest for people (2:17). The word <em>Because</em> indicates that 2:18a is the reason why Jesus is able to help people when they are tempted (2:18b).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is not necessary to make both of these connections explicit. Make the meaning clear in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He Himself suffered when He was tempted:</strong> The Greek phrase the BSB translates as <em>suffered when He was tempted</em> is literally “suffered being tempted/tested.” Scholars interpret the connection between “suffered” and “being tempted” in different ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Jesus was tempted, and the temptation caused him to suffer. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he himself suffered when he was tempted (NIV) <em>(BSB, NJB, NIV, JBP, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Jesus suffered, and the suffering caused him to be tempted. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jesus experienced temptation when he suffered (GW) <em>(GW, NRSV, NASB, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Jesus was tempted and he also suffered. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he himself was tempted and suffered (GNT) <em>(NLT, RSV, CEV, NCV, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The meanings of these interpretations are similar, and the differences seem to be mainly a matter of emphasis.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Interpretation (1) emphasizes Jesus’ temptation and the result—he is able to help those who are tempted. This theme is repeated in Hebrews 4:15. For this reason, the Notes has listed it as interpretation (1) here.</span></span> You may translate any of these interpretations in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>He Himself:</strong> The phrase <em>He Himself</em> emphasizes Jesus in contrast to “those who are being tempted” in 2:18b. Translate this contrast in a natural way in your language. See the Display for examples.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>suffered:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>suffered</em> is a general word that can refer to enduring any kind of pain or hardship. The form of the word implies that Jesus endured this suffering over a period of time. Some other ways to translate it are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>has suffered (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>has gone through suffering (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>experienced distress/hardship</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages there may be an idiom that expresses this meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>He was tempted:</strong> The phrase <em>He was tempted</em> is passive. The Greek text does not specify who or what tempted Jesus. This clause may refer to temptation by Satan. It may also include other sources of temptations, such as other people or the weaknesses of human nature. For that reason, it is best not to make explicit who or what tempted him. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Jesus experienced temptation (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, if you must provide a subject, you may indicate that Satan tempted Jesus. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Satan</span> tempted Jesus</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>was tempted:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the word <em>tempted</em> in this context:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>tempted</u>. It refers here to temptation to sin. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and was tempted (NCV) <em>(BSB, NIV, RSV, GNT, NASB, NET, JBP, KJV, GW, NLT, NCV, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>tested</u>. It refers here to a test of Jesus’ faithfulness to God during suffering. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he himself has passed through the test of suffering (REB) <em>(NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). It is followed by most English versions and a majority of Bible scholars.</p><h4>2:18b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:18b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He is able to help those who are being tempted.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>he is able to help others when they are tempted.</p></li><li><p>he is able to strengthen other people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so that they do not sin</span> when they experience temptation.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He is able to help those who are being tempted:</strong> This part of the verse tells the result of 2:18a. Jesus was tempted (2:18a), so he is able to help those who are being tempted. Other ways to translate this result are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>That is how/why he is able to help those who are being tempted.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>therefore he can really help us when we also are tested/tempted.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Tagbanwa back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate the result in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>help:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>help</em> is a general word that can refer to different ways to assist or support someone. In this context, Jesus helps people to resist and overcome temptation so that they do not sin.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Jesus uses many different ways to help people who are tempted. For example, he encourages them, he gives them spiritual and physical strength, he shows them what he wants them to do, and he may cause other people to help them. Having been tempted himself, Jesus understands how to help those who are being tempted.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Jesus helps those who are tempted so that they can resist the temptation and not sin against God. This is the main purpose for Jesus’ help. In some languages it may be necessary to make this purpose explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he can help the people who are tempted so that they are not carried to sin<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Yakan back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>those who are being tempted:</strong> The phrase <em>those who are being tempted</em> is a general statement that is true for anyone who is tempted. Languages have different ways to refer to people in general statements like this. For example, some languages may use “we,” “anyone,” or “whoever.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>anyone who is tempted</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when we are tempted</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In other languages it may be more natural to refer only to the temptation without mentioning who is tempted. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>during the time of temptation</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a natural option for your language.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>are being tempted:</strong> The form of the Greek verb which the BSB translates as <em>are being tempted</em> indicates that the temptation continues for some time or that it happens often over a period of time. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>are tempted (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this meaning in a natural way in your language.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:18a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to reorder the clauses in this verse. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>18b</sup>And now he can help those who are tempted, <sup>18a</sup>because he himself was tempted and suffered. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to translate this verse as two sentences. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He himself was tempted and suffered. So he is able to help us when we are tempted.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The author mentioned temptation and the help of our great high priest again in 4:15–16.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In chapters 1 and 2, the author showed that God has now spoken through his Son Jesus. Jesus is greater than the angels, so people must pay more attention to him than to the angels.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In 3:1–4:13, the author showed that Jesus was also greater than Moses, who led God’s people, the people of Israel, out of Egypt. Moses led them as God’s faithful servant, but Jesus leads them as God’s own Son. Now God’s people include all the people who follow his Son, whether they are people of Israel or not. Jesus is the high priest of the better covenant that God made with his people.</p></div>",

Moses was faithful as a servant in God’s house, but Jesus is God’s Son. He is faithful as a Son, taking care of God’s household for God. Because of that he is worthy of more honor than Moses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Moses was God’s faithful servant, but Jesus was God’s faithful Son</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jesus and Moses (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Some English versions include all of chapter 3 in one section. However, Section 3:7–19 is the second of the important warning sections in the book of Hebrews. (The first warning was in 2:1–4.) It is often helpful to readers to provide separate headings for each of these warning sections.</p></div><h4>3:1</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse is complex. In some languages it is more natural to change the order of clauses or to translate the clauses as two sentences. For examples of how to reorder the clauses in this verse, see the General Comment on 3:1a–b at the end of 3:1b.</p><h4>3:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Therefore, holy brothers, who share in the heavenly calling,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ So then, holy brothers and sisters, who share God’s call/invitation,</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">My</span> fellow Christians, God himself called you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be his children</span>.

So because of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what I have said to you,</span><sup>(plur)</sup></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Therefore:</strong> The Greek word which the BSB translates as <em>Therefore</em><span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span><em>hothen</em>. Koester (page 242) says that this Greek conjunction “indicates that the author is drawing out the implications of what has just been said. The term consistently appears in the middle of an argument rather than at the beginning of a new section (2:17, 2:25, 8:3, 9:18, 11:19).”</span></span> introduces the exhortation in 3:1 to “set your focus on Jesus.” The Greek word implies that readers should focus on him <u>because of</u> what was said about him in chapters 1 and 2, and more specifically because of 2:17–18. Those verses indicate that Jesus is a merciful and faithful high priest for his followers. <em>Therefore</em> they must think about him and pay attention to him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this connection are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Because of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all</span> this</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Now therefore<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Tagbanwa back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Because of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all that I have said</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate the connection in a natural and clear way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>holy brothers, who share in the heavenly calling:</strong> Scholars differ about what the word <em>holy</em> describes in this phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It describes <em>holy brothers</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>holy brothers and sisters (NIV) <em>(BSB, NIV, RSV, ESV, NASB, NLT, NET, NCV, JBP, REB, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It describes <em>share</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>holy partners (NRSV) <em>(NRSV, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), along with most English versions and many commentaries.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Among these are Translator’s Handbook (page 51), Bruce (page 91), Ellingworth (page 198), Koester (page 242), Lane (page 74), Miller (page 64), and Westcott (page 73). Mitchell (page 80) says, “Given the distance between it and <em>metochoi</em>, the adjective more naturally modifies <em>adelphoi</em>, which encompasses both brothers and sisters….”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here the author addressed his readers directly for the first time in Hebrews. The phrase <em>holy brothers, who share in the heavenly calling</em> addresses the readers directly, as if the phrases were names. The author used them to focus special attention on what he was about to say in 3:1b (“set your focus on Jesus”).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may not be natural to use a long phrase to address someone directly. So it may be more natural to translate 3:1a in a different way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>holy brothers and sisters, you share in a heavenly calling</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>relatives, you belong to God and he has called you to enter heaven</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In this sermon (letter) the author rarely used this type of direct address. The only other places are in 3:12, 10:19, 13:22 (“brothers”), and in 6:9 (“dear friends”).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>holy brothers:</strong> The phrase <em>holy brothers</em> refers back to 2:11, where the author mentioned Jesus as the one who makes people <em>holy</em>. He said also that Jesus is not ashamed to call them <em>brothers</em> and sisters. They are <em>brothers</em> and sisters of Jesus and of each other. Translate the words <em>holy</em> and <em>brothers</em> in a similar way as you did in 2:11.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate <em>holy brothers</em> here are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>brothers and sisters dedicated to God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Relatives who belong to God<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>holy:</strong> The word <em>holy</em> means “dedicated to God,” “belonging to God,” “sanctified.” In 2:11, the author spoke of Jesus as the one who “sanctifies.” That means that he is the one who dedicates people to God so that they belong to him. See the examples in the preceding note.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The fact that God’s people are <em>holy</em> is one of the themes of the book. See also 10:10, 10:14, 12:10, and 12:14. For more information, see <u>holy, sense A3(a)</u>, in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>brothers:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>brothers</em> refers here to fellow believers in Christ. It includes both male and female. Believers call each other “brothers and sisters” because they have all been received into God’s family through becoming followers of Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate the word here are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>My Christian friends (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>dear brothers and sisters who belong to God (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>who share in the heavenly calling:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>who share</em> (“sharers”) means “people who use or own (something) in common or participate together in (something).”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span><em>μέτοχος</em>, BDAG, page 643.</span></span> Here it indicates that the author and readers have all been called by God (they <em>share</em> that calling).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may not be natural to <em>share</em> a <em>calling</em>. If that is true in your language, some other ways to translate the meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who share in being called by God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>whom God called along with others to be in his family</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This word is also used in 3:14 in the phrase “to share in Christ.” In 2:14 another form of the word referred to Jesus “sharing” blood and flesh.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>heavenly calling:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the phrase <em>heavenly calling</em> in this context:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It indicates that the calling is <u>from God</u>. The word <em>heavenly</em> is a way to refer to God.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For the Jews, “heaven” could be used as a reference to God. They avoided using God’s name directly, out of reverence. Thus Matthew often refers to “the kingdom of heaven” rather than “the kingdom of God.”</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>called by God (GNT) <em>(GNT, NCV, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to being called <u>to heaven</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>called to heaven (NLT) <em>(NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions are ambiguous, and the interpretations are similar. However, if you must choose, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). In this context the author focuses more on the call to be in God’s family than on our call to heaven.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">A <em>heavenly calling</em> indicates that God has invited or chosen people to be his children. Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God chose you to be his people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you whom God invited/told <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be his children</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages “God called” a person implies a wrong meaning here. It implies that the person died. If that is true in your language, you should use a different word.</p><h4>3:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>set your focus on Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>meditate<sup>(plur)</sup> on Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we<sup>(incl)</sup> acknowledge/follow.</p></li><li><p>concentrate<sup>(plur)</sup> on Jesus. He is the one whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> sent to us. He is the high priest whom we<sup>(incl)</sup> say that we believe/trust.</p></li><li><p>think<sup>(plur)</sup> about Jesus. God sent him to us<sup>(incl)</sup>, and he is the high priest whom we profess and follow.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In this verse the author compared Jesus to Moses. The BSB and other English versions use a different order of words than the Greek text uses. In Greek, 3:1b–2 is literally:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>consider carefully the apostle and high priest of our confession, Jesus</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice that the name “Jesus” is the last word in the verse. Another way to translate this order is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Pay attention to the one who is the apostle of God and the High Priest that we believe in: He is Jesus.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek this order of words emphasizes Jesus. English versions have probably changed the order to emphasize Jesus more clearly in English. Use an order of words in your language that emphasizes Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>set your focus on Jesus:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>set your focus on Jesus</em> is more literally “consider…Jesus.” This phrase means “think carefully about.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDAG, page 522. This verb occurs once more in Hebrews in 10:24, where people are encouraged to “think about” other believers.</span></span> Some other ways to translate the phrase <em>set your focus on</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>reflect on Jesus (NAB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>think seriously about Jesus</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages there is an idiom to express this. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>fix your thoughts on Jesus (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>turn your minds to Jesus (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess:</strong> The phrase <em>Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess</em> indicates that we believe and publicly declare that Jesus is our apostle and high priest. In this context the word <em>confess</em> refers to “confessing the faith.” To <em>confess</em> the faith refers to making a statement that tells what followers of Jesus believe.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate <em>the apostle and high priest whom we confess</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Jesus, the apostle and chief priest about whom we make our declaration of faith (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>this Jesus whom we declare to be God’s Messenger and High Priest (NLT96)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the apostle and high priest:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the apostle and high priest</em> indicates the roles that God gave Jesus. God sent him (so he is called <em>apostle</em>), and God made him the <em>high priest</em> for us.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>apostle:</strong> The English word <em>apostle</em> comes from the Greek word which means “one who is sent.” An apostle can be sent to say something or to do something. In the New Testament the word <em>apostle</em> usually refers to the disciples whom Jesus sent to tell people the Gospel. Here it refers to Jesus. It indicates that Jesus is the one whom God sent to people for a special purpose.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Hebrews 3:1 is the only verse in the NT where <em>apostle</em> refers to Jesus himself. However, Koester (page 243) lists the following NT verses that refer to Jesus as the one “sent” from God (e.g., Matthew 10:40, 15:24; Mark 9:37; Luke 10:16; John 3:17, 5:36, 17:3; 1 John 4:9–14).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate <em>apostle</em> in this context are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s Messenger (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who was sent to us (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, the term for <em>apostle</em> in the Gospels is “the messenger of Jesus Christ.” Here in Hebrews a term like that should be changed. The term should indicate that God sent <u>Jesus</u> as the apostle (messenger). Also be sure to use a different term for <em>apostle</em> than you use for “prophet” or “angel.” For more information, see <u>apostle, sense 1</u>, in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>high priest:</strong> Here the author repeated the phrase <em>high priest</em> that he used in 2:17. He repeated it here because he was about to teach people more about Jesus being our high priest. He gave the main part of this teaching from 4:14 onwards. Translate <em>high priest</em> in the same way as you did in 2:17.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>whom we confess:</strong> The phrase <em>whom we confess</em> means “what we say/declare that we believe.” In this context the word <em>confess</em> refers to people making a statement in public about what they believe. It does not refer here to confessing sins.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word that the BSB translates here as <em>confess</em> occurs six times in the New Testament. For translation examples, see the note on “Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess” earlier in this part of the verse.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:1a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The clauses in 3:1 are complex. In some languages it is more natural to translate the connections in a simpler way or to use more than one sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My Christian friends, who also have been called by God! Think of Jesus, whom God sent to be the High Priest of the faith we profess. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My holy brothers/relatives, you share in being called by God. Think about Jesus. He is the one whom God sent to us, and he is the supreme priest of our faith.</p></blockquote></div>",

God is the one who appointed Jesus to be the high priest for God’s people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be helpful to begin a new sentence in 3:2a. It may also be helpful to refer explicitly to God as the one who appointed Jesus. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He was faithful to God, who chose him to do this work (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Jesus is faithful to God, who appointed him. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He was trustworthy to obey God, as he did what God appointed/chose him to do</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>was faithful:</strong> The word <em>faithful</em> means “reliable, trustworthy.” Here it indicates that Jesus was worthy to be trusted. God could depend on him to do what is right and good. Some other ways to translate it in this context are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>did what <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> trusted him to do</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>was trustworthy/dependable</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It was also used about Jesus in 2:17.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to the One who appointed Him:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>appointed</em> is the common verb that is sometimes translated as “do” or “make.” Here it indicates that God gave Jesus the role of apostle and high priest. Use an appropriate verb in your language to refer to appointing someone to be a priest.</p><h4>3:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>just as Moses was faithful in all God’s house.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>in the same way that Moses was faithful/dependable in God’s whole household.</p></li><li><p>Moses also <span data-bnType=\"implied\">did exactly what</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> told him to do when he served in God’s house for all God’s people.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In this part of the verse, the author quoted Numbers 12:7, where God said that he spoke to other prophets in dreams or visions. Then he said, “But this is not true of my servant Moses who is faithful in all my house.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>just as Moses was faithful in all God’s house:</strong> Here the author compared Jesus to Moses. Jesus was faithful to God, just as Moses was faithful. The phrase <em>faithful in all God’s house</em> indicates that Jesus and Moses were both faithful as they led all God’s people. You should translate the word <em>faithful</em> as you did in 3:2a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>just as Moses was faithful in serving all of God’s people (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in the same way that Moses was faithful when he served/worked in God’s house</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he was faithful doing the work that God ordered him to do, like Moses long ago was faithful doing his work taking care of the people of God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Moses was:</strong> Moses is mentioned here for the first time in Hebrews. The RSV adds the word “also” to refer back to Jesus, who was mentioned in 3:1b. Moses and Jesus were both faithful.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Jews respected Moses as their great leader and the one who gave them God’s Law. If you use footnotes, you may want to include a footnote about Moses. An example of a possible footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Moses was a great leader in the Old Testament. He led the people of Israel out of slavery in Egypt, and guided them to the land that God had prepared for them. Throughout the books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, he is the chief leader of Israel.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>was faithful:</strong> See the note on 3:2a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in all God’s house:</strong> There is a textual issue here concerning the word that the BSB translates as <em>all</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some Greek manuscripts have a word that means “whole.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>with God’s entire house (NLT) <em>(BSB, NIV, NRSV, NLT, CEV, NJB, NASB, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Other Greek manuscripts do not have the word “whole.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in God’s house (RSV) <em>(RSV, GNT, REB, JBP, GW, NCV, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1). In 3:5 the author includes the word “all” when he refers to the Greek text of Numbers 12:7. However, there is good support for both options in manuscripts, English versions and commentaries.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For various reasons, it is difficult for scholars to decide which option is better. Metzger (4<sup>th</sup> Edition, page 594) says, “Both external evidence and transcriptional probabilities are…difficult to evaluate.” The committee decided to include “all” in the text with a C rating, which indicates that the textual decision was uncertain.</span></span> You may choose to follow either text and include a footnote to give the other possibility. For example, the NRSV has this footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Other ancient authorities lack <em>all</em></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate <em>all</em> here are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all God’s people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s entire house (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>God’s house:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>house</em> occurs six times between 3:2 and 3:6. It has two different meanings in these verses:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>household/family<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDAG, <em>oikos</em>, meaning 2, page 699.</span></span></p></li><li><p>dwelling<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDAG, <em>oikos</em>, meaning 1, page 698.</span></span> (building where one or more people live).</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">In some contexts the author has used the word in a way that can imply both of these meanings. In many languages there is no word that can have both of these meanings. If that is true in your language, you will need to translate the most likely meaning in each context.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In this context the word <em>house</em> refers to the people of Israel.

It is often helpful to readers to provide separate headings for each of these warning sections.</p></div><h4>3:5–6a</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Now…But:</strong> In Greek, the introductory phrases for 3:5 and 3:6 are more literally:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5a</sup>and Moses, as for (him)…<sup>6a</sup>but as for Christ…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">These phrases indicate a contrast between the ways that Jesus and Moses were faithful. Moses was faithful as God’s servant (3:5), but Christ was faithful as God’s Son (3:6). The word <em>Now</em> (literally “and”) is not used as a time word here. It implies that in 3:5–6 the author will continue to speak about what he said in 3:2–4.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>David L. Allen (<em>Hebrews</em>, NAC, page 245) gives three possible functions for <em>kai</em> here, listing them in “descending order of probability: (1) It could be an explicative, connecting a clause that explains and summarizes vv. 2–4, and thus translated ‘and so.’ In this vein, some see it introducing an additional reason for expecting to find Jesus to be faithful; others as a second proof of Jesus’ superiority over Moses. (2) It could be ascensive, sharpening the contrast being drawn, and thus translated ‘indeed.’ (3) It could be adding another reason for expecting to find fidelity in Christ and thus ascribing to him greater glory. Both Lane and Ellingworth take it as further clarifying and explaining the previous comment concerning the faithfulness and superiority of Jesus contrasted with Moses.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate these connections are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>So</u> Moses was <u>certainly</u> faithful…as a servant, <u>but</u> Christ was faithful as a son</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>It is true</u> that Moses was faithful in serving…. <u>But</u> Christ…was <u>rather</u> his Child who was faithful as being in charge</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate the connection between 3:5 and 3:6 carefully so that the contrast between Moses and Jesus is clear in your language. For another translation example, see the General Comment on 3:5–6a at the end of 3:6a.</p><h4>3:5a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:5a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Now Moses was faithful as a servant in all God’s house,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It is true that</span> Moses was trustworthy as a servant in charge of God’s household</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We</span><sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">know that</span> Moses did exactly what God told him to do when he was the servant who took care of God’s people/family.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Moses was faithful as a servant:</strong> The words <em>Moses was faithful as a servant</em> implies that Moses obeyed God and did what God told him to do, just as a faithful servant should. Some ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Moses was certainly faithful in God’s house, but only as a servant. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is true that Moses served faithfully in the household of God. But he was only like a servant in that household.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>faithful:</strong> The word <em>faithful</em> describes someone who is worthy to be trusted. He is reliable and God can depend on him to do what God wants him to do. This is the same Greek word used in 3:2a. You should translate it in the same way here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>servant:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>servant</em> appears only here in the NT. It refers to a worker who serves another person willingly, not as a slave. The service is honorable. Usually the word also implies a good relationship between the servant and the person whom he serves. Moses was a faithful servant of God.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This is the only occurrence of the Greek word <em>therapōn</em> in the NT, though it is used in the Greek OT (the Septuagint).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Use an appropriate way in your language to refer to this type of relationship. Some other ways to translate it are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>worker</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>steward</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in all God’s house:</strong> The phrase <em>in all God’s house</em> was also used in 3:2b. Translate it in the same way in both verses.</p><h4>3:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>testifying to what would be spoken later.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to tell <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his people</span> about the things which were to be spoken afterward.</p></li><li><p>He made known to them what <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">planned</span> to say in the future.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>testifying to what would be spoken later:</strong> This phrase tells how Moses was faithful (3:5a). He was faithful to tell the people of Israel that in the future God was planning to speak new things to them. The Greek expression which the BSB translates as <em>testifying to</em> means “for/as a testimony.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Most English versions agree that this refers to things that Moses <u>said</u>. But it was also Moses’ faithful life and service that anticipated the coming Christ. So the NLT has: “His work was an illustration of the truths God would reveal later.”</span></span> Moses testified to things that would happen after he died.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and his work was only a foreshadowing of the truth that would be known later (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>His work was an illustration of the truths God would reveal later (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And what he did was like a prophecy/picture of what God planned to make clear in the future.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also Deuteronomy 18:15–19, where God promised to send a prophet greater than Moses. Bible scholars believe that this promise refers to the Messiah.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>what would be spoken later:</strong> The clause <em>what would be spoken later</em> refers to what God would reveal at a future time (when he sent Jesus to the people). This is a passive clause. In some languages it is more natural to use an active verb and indicate that God is the subject. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>things God would say in the future (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>later:</strong> Here the word <em>later</em> refers to a time hundreds of years after Moses died. Use an appropriate word in your language to refer to such a time in the future.</p>",

Christ was faithful as God’s son to fulfill all the responsibilities of a son. As the son, he was in charge of God’s house. In contrast, Moses (3:5) was a servant to God, so he only had to fulfill the responsibilities of a servant.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate the contrast are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But Christ is a faithful son in charge of God’s household.

He used it as a title to refer to Jesus as the person whom God had appointed and promised to send as king and savior. The title <em>Christ</em> is the Greek translation of the Hebrew word “messiah,” and the two words have the same meaning. You should use the same word for <em>Christ</em> here as you use in the Gospels.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate <em>Christ</em> are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a title or a descriptive phrase in your language that has the same meaning as <em>Christ</em>.

Or you may want to explain the meaning in a glossary. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The word/title “Christ” refers to the king and savior whom God had promised to send.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also <u>Christ</u> in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>faithful:</strong> The word that the BSB translates as <em>faithful</em> here is the same Greek word used in 3:2a. See the note there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>as the Son over God’s house:</strong> The phrase <em>as the Son over God’s house</em> refers to Christ’s role in God’s household. It implies that Christ is in charge of the household and is responsible for it. God completely trusts Christ to take care of the household, as a human father trusts his oldest son. The term <em>Son</em> does not imply that God procreated Jesus as a human father procreates a son.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate <em>as the Son over God’s house</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as God’s son he takes care of God’s family/people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He is the son of God whose being in charge of the house was carried out faithfully.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Western Bukidnon Manobo back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">For more information, see the note on “his Son” in 1:2a.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>God’s house:</strong> The phrase <em>God’s house</em> refers here to God’s household.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A few scholars take the word “his” to refer to Christ.

This view is supported by a majority of English versions, including the BSB, NIV, RSV, GNT, NET, GW, NLT, NCV, and the CEV. Some versions are ambiguous, including the NASB and ESV.

In 2:1–4 he gave a <u>first</u> warning not to refuse the message which Jesus brought. Here in 3:7–19 he gave a <u>second</u> warning not to refuse Jesus’ message, especially the “rest” that God offers through Jesus. The author quoted from Psalm 95, which says that God wanted to give the people of Israel a land where they could have rest from their enemies. When they were slaves in Egypt, he sent Moses to lead them to that land, but they rebelled against God in the wilderness. Then God did not allow them to enter the land of rest.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">It is often difficult to decide how to translate “rest” in this section and in chapter 4. Psalm 95 and Hebrews do refer to the time when Moses was alive and God promised to give the people of Israel land. However, King David was already in that land when he wrote the psalm, so the “rest” could not refer to the land. It refers to a different type of “rest.” That rest is a way of trusting God and depending on him for everything. We especially trust him to save us from our sins and give us eternal life. Because of the rest that God gives, we can have peace even when we suffer.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Be careful not to imply that the rest that God promises his people today is a certain place or land. Some scholars believe that the rest refers to heaven. It is true that we will have perfect rest in heaven, but Hebrews indicates that the rest that God provides for us begins on earth when we trust in Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Rest for God’s People</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Warning Against Unbelief (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We Must Continue to Follow/Obey God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Scholars differ about where to end this warning section. Some scholars end the warning at 3:19. Others make the warning section continue to 4:13. In these notes, 3:19 is the end of this second warning section, and the following section is 4:1–13.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1059003007\" data-endVerseId=\"1059003011\"><h3>Paragraph 3:7–11</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">This paragraph contains a long quotation. You should use the format which you usually use for such quotations. This quotation from Psalm 95:7b–11 refers to the years when the people of Israel were traveling through the desert to the land of Canaan. God did many miracles for them, but they often complained against him.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In 3:8a–9a the quotation from Psalm 95 probably refers to a specific time when the people of Israel complained.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There are two main views about which “rebellion” and “day of testing” the author referred to here:(a) He referred to the time that the Israelites rebelled against God at Kadesh Barnea. They refused to enter the land of Canaan that God promised to give them (Numbers 14:22).(b) He referred to the time that the Israelites rebelled against God at the place that was later named Meribah and Massah. They complained that they had no water, and they made God angry by their attitude and by what they said (Exodus 17:1–7).Option (a) is probably more likely in this context.</span></span> It may refer to Exodus 17:1–7, when they did not find water to drink where they camped. However, it is more likely that it refers to Numbers 14, where they refused to enter the land that the Lord wanted to give them. That interpretation fits well with the theme of “rest” in Hebrews 4.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In 3:9b–11 the author referred to what the people of Israel did during the whole forty year period when they wandered through the desert. In 3:7–8a he indicates that followers of Jesus must not stubbornly reject what God tells them to do, as the people of Israel did in the desert.</p></div><h4>3:7–8</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">The Greek text of 3:7 refers to God’s voice as “his voice,” and in 3:8 the author does not need to refer to him explicitly. However, in 3:9–11, the author uses pronouns like “I,” “me” and “my” to refer to God. English versions differ in the way they refer to God in 3:7–8. Refer to him in those verses in a way that is clear in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some ways to translate 3:7–8 are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As the Holy Spirit says, “If you hear <u>God</u> speak today, don’t be stubborn. Don’t be stubborn like those who rebelled and tested <u>me</u> in the desert. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So then, as the Holy Spirit says, “If you hear God’s voice today, do not be stubborn, as your ancestors were when they rebelled against <u>God</u>, as they were that day in the desert when they put <u>him</u> to the test. (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>3:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ So as the Holy Spirit says:</p></li><li><p>¶ Because of this, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we</span><sup>(incl)</sup>/<span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">must do</span> as the Holy Spirit says <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the Scripture</span>:</p></li><li><p>¶ As the Holy Spirit said/spoke <span data-bnType=\"implied\">through King David</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in God’s Word/book</span>:</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Therefore:</strong> The conjunction <em>Therefore</em><span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In the book of Hebrews, this conjunction (<em>dio</em>) occurs in the following verses: 3:7, 3:10, 6:1, 10:5, 11:12, 11:16, 12:12, 12:28, and 13:12. It always occurs first in the sentence.</span></span> introduces a conclusion from 3:1–6. We are God’s house (family), so we must listen to him and do what he says. Some ways to translate the conjunction are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Because of that</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now, therefore</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as the Holy Spirit says:</strong> This phrase introduces a quotation from Scripture. It implies that the Holy Spirit is the one who spoke those words and inspired a person to write them. The phrase is another way to refer to what Scripture says. This is the first time that the author introduced a quotation from the Old Testament in this way.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here the author quoted what King David wrote in Psalm 95:7b–11. In some languages it may be helpful to refer to King David by name here, as the author does in 4:7, when he quotes from Psalm 95 again. Be sure to indicate or imply that the author referred to Scripture. It is often helpful to use the normal way that you refer to Scripture in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>As the Holy Spirit said <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and King David wrote in God’s book</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Holy Spirit spoke <span data-bnType=\"implied\">through King David</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and it was written</span> saying</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It is also helpful in some languages to include part of the meaning of the quotation in the introduction, so that it sounds more natural. Notice the implied words in the following example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Therefore <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you must do</span> as the Holy Spirit said,</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Holy Spirit:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>Holy Spirit</em> refers to the Spirit of God. The Holy Spirit is God, together with God the Father and God the Son. The Holy Spirit is “spirit” in the sense that he is a living being who does not have a physical body. He is “holy” in the sense that he is God and unique from every other being. He is perfect in every way and is completely pure and sinless.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate <em>Holy Spirit</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Spirit/Breath of God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Holy/Sacred Spirit</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Do not imply that the <em>Holy Spirit</em> is like the ghost of a dead person or that God has died. The term <em>Holy Spirit</em> also occurred in 2:4c. See how you translated it there.</p><h4>3:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Today, if you hear His voice,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“Today as you<sup>(plur)</sup> hear his voice,</p></li><li><p>“Listen<sup>(plur)</sup> to what he says today:</p></li><li><p>“Be<sup>(plur)</sup> sure to listen to those words of his today.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Here the author began to quote from Psalm 95.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Today:</strong> In this context the word <em>Today</em> refers to the present moment or time. Some ways to translate <em>Today</em> in the context are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>right now</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>now at this time</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>on this very day</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here the word <em>Today</em> comes first in the sentence to emphasize it. It implies that when a person hears God voice, he should respond immediately. He should not delay.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if you hear His voice:</strong> There are several ways to interpret the <em>if</em> clause here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>that you should listen to</u> what God says. (It is a command or exhortation.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Allen (page 235–236, Kindle edition) says, “The hortatory nature of Hebrews 3:1–6 is signaled by…the use of an imperative in 3:1 and an imperatival idea semantically encoded in the conditional clause of verse 6.”</span></span>) For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you must listen to his voice (NLT96)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Oh, that today you would listen…! (NET) <em>(NET, NLT96, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>when you hear</u> what God says. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when you hear his voice (NLT04) <em>(NLT04, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>if you hear</u> what God says. (It is a condition.) For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If you hear God speak (GW) <em>(BSB, NIV, NRSV, ESV, NASB, REB, GW, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), along with many Bible scholars.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Translator’s Handbook (page 60) says, “The Greek word usually means ‘if,’ but sometimes, as in John 12:32, 14:3; 1 John 2:28, it is virtually equal to ‘when.’ Here the question is not whether people will ‘hear God’s voice (since God is speaking or is about to speak in this very passage), but whether, when people have heard his voice, they will obey it.”</span></span> Although more English versions have <em>if</em>, it may imply a wrong meaning here. In this context, the <em>if</em> clause does not imply that the listeners may not hear God’s voice. The author is about to tell them what God says.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you:</strong> The pronoun <em>you</em> is plural and refers to all the people who hear (or read) what God said.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>hear His voice:</strong> The phrase <em>hear His voice</em> refers here to listening to what God says. It implies listening in order to obey. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>listen to him!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>hear what he says <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and obey it</span></p></blockquote>",

In 2:1–4 he gave a <u>first</u> warning not to refuse the message which Jesus brought. Here in 3:7–19 he gave a <u>second</u> warning not to refuse Jesus’ message, especially the “rest” that God offers through Jesus. The author quoted from Psalm 95, which says that God wanted to give the people of Israel a land where they could have rest from their enemies. When they were slaves in Egypt, he sent Moses to lead them to that land, but they rebelled against God in the wilderness. Then God did not allow them to enter the land of rest.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">It is often difficult to decide how to translate “rest” in this section and in chapter 4. Psalm 95 and Hebrews do refer to the time when Moses was alive and God promised to give the people of Israel land. However, King David was already in that land when he wrote the psalm, so the “rest” could not refer to the land. It refers to a different type of “rest.” That rest is a way of trusting God and depending on him for everything. We especially trust him to save us from our sins and give us eternal life. Because of the rest that God gives, we can have peace even when we suffer.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Be careful not to imply that the rest that God promises his people today is a certain place or land.

You should use the format which you usually use for such quotations. This quotation from Psalm 95:7b–11 refers to the years when the people of Israel were traveling through the desert to the land of Canaan.

That interpretation fits well with the theme of “rest” in Hebrews 4.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In 3:9b–11 the author referred to what the people of Israel did during the whole forty year period when they wandered through the desert. In 3:7–8a he indicates that followers of Jesus must not stubbornly reject what God tells them to do, as the people of Israel did in the desert.</p></div><h4>3:9a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>where your fathers tested and tried Me, and for forty years saw My works:</strong> This verse tells about the Israelites’ time in “the wilderness” (mentioned in 3:8). In many languages it may be more natural to begin a new sentence at this verse. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>9a</sup>There your ancestors tested and tried my patience, <sup>9b</sup>even though they saw my miracles for forty years. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to change the order of 3:9a and 3:9b.

BDAG (page 495) lists its sense here as “emphasizing a fact as surprising or unexpected or noteworthy.” In this context the text implies that the Israelites should have reacted to the Lord’s mighty works with obedience, not by rebelling against him. Allen (page 258, Kindle edition) says, “The <em>kai</em> (“and”) can introduce an added thought…or, more likely, a concession: ‘although they saw.’”</span></span> When they saw what God did, they should have obeyed him.

It implies that God was angry because they tested him and did not believe in him. Some ways to translate the connection in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As a result</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I was angry with that generation:</strong> This clause explains why God was angry with the people who rebelled against him.

The connection depends on the interpretation of the word that the BSB translates as “So”:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The word “So” indicates that God’s oath was a <u>result</u> of the people’s disobedience (3:8–10). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>So</u> I vowed in my anger (REB) <em>(BSB, NIV, REB, GW, NLT, NJB, KJV,)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The word “So” implies that the people who disobeyed will not enter God’s rest, <u>just as</u> God said they will not enter it. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>As</u> I swore in my wrath (ESV) <em>(NRSV, ESV, NET, NASB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">Several English versions (GNT, CEV, and NCV) do not translate the word “So.” It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), along with the majority of English versions and commentaries.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>With the notable exception of Westcott (page 82), a majority of English commentators follow interpretation (1), including Allen, Bruce, Cockerill, Ellingworth, Lane, Miller, and Montefiore. The Translator’s Handbook (Ellingworth and Nida) also follows this interpretation.</span></span></p><h4>3:11a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:11a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So I swore on oath in My anger,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>So I angrily promised,</p></li><li><p>Because of that, I became angry, and I spoke these words that cannot change/fail:</p></li><li><p>So I angrily took a solemn oath (GW)</p></li></ul></div><h4>3:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>‘They shall never enter My rest.’”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>‘They will never come into my rest.’ ”</p></li><li><p>‘<span data-bnType=\"implied\">I will</span> never <span data-bnType=\"implied\">allow</span> these people to have/receive the rest that I <span data-bnType=\"implied\">offered</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">them</span>.’ ”</p></li><li><p>that they will never obtain my rest.”</p></li></ul></div><h4>3:11a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So I swore on oath in My anger, ‘They shall never enter My rest’:</strong> The clause <em>So I swore on oath in My anger</em> indicates that God was angry when the people disobeyed him, so he vowed that they would never enter his rest. Some other ways to translate the clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was angry and made a promise, “They will never enter my rest.” (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So in my anger I made a vow: “They will never enter my place of rest.” (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>They shall never enter My rest:</strong> Here God vowed that those who did not trust and obey him would never receive the type of rest that he wanted to give them. Some ways to translate the meaning in this context are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They will never receive the rest that I <span data-bnType=\"implied\">planned to give them</span>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they certainly will not be able to rest under my care</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">For information on how to translate <em>rest</em> in this context, refer again to the introduction to Section 3:7–19.</p>",

In 2:1–4 he gave a <u>first</u> warning not to refuse the message which Jesus brought. Here in 3:7–19 he gave a <u>second</u> warning not to refuse Jesus’ message, especially the “rest” that God offers through Jesus. The author quoted from Psalm 95, which says that God wanted to give the people of Israel a land where they could have rest from their enemies. When they were slaves in Egypt, he sent Moses to lead them to that land, but they rebelled against God in the wilderness. Then God did not allow them to enter the land of rest.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">It is often difficult to decide how to translate “rest” in this section and in chapter 4. Psalm 95 and Hebrews do refer to the time when Moses was alive and God promised to give the people of Israel land. However, King David was already in that land when he wrote the psalm, so the “rest” could not refer to the land. It refers to a different type of “rest.” That rest is a way of trusting God and depending on him for everything. We especially trust him to save us from our sins and give us eternal life. Because of the rest that God gives, we can have peace even when we suffer.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Be careful not to imply that the rest that God promises his people today is a certain place or land. Some scholars believe that the rest refers to heaven. It is true that we will have perfect rest in heaven, but Hebrews indicates that the rest that God provides for us begins on earth when we trust in Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Rest for God’s People</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Warning Against Unbelief (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We Must Continue to Follow/Obey God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Scholars differ about where to end this warning section. Some scholars end the warning at 3:19. Others make the warning section continue to 4:13. In these notes, 3:19 is the end of this second warning section, and the following section is 4:1–13.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1059003012\" data-endVerseId=\"1059003015\"><h3>Paragraph 3:12–15</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph the author told his readers and listeners how they should apply the quotation in 3:7b–11 to themselves. Just as God warned the people of Israel to be careful not to turn away from him, the Hebrews should also be careful. They should not refuse to believe what God said, as the Israelites did.</p></div><h4>3:12a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:12a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>See to it, brothers,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Be careful, brothers and sisters, (GW)</p></li><li><p>¶ Fellow members of God’s family, see/beware</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>See to it:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>See to it</em> is literally just <em>See</em>. In this context it is a warning. It means “be careful,” “watch out.” The author warned his readers not to commit the same sin of unbelief and disobedience that the Israelites committed. Other ways to translate this verb are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Be careful (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Take care (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>brothers:</strong> As in 3:1a, the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>brothers</em> refers to the author’s fellow believers in Christ. You should translate it in the same way here. Remember that the term includes both men and women. For more information, see the note on 3:1a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to place the word <em>brothers</em> first in the sentence or in a different place in the sentence. You should place it where it is most natural for your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So brothers and sisters, be careful (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>My friends, watch out! (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Be careful then, dear brothers and sisters.

He is the One who has/owns life.</p></li></ul></div><h4>3:12b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that none of you has a wicked heart of unbelief that turns away from the living God:</strong> In this context the word <em>heart</em> represents a person himself. It especially refers here to a person’s decision to believe in and trust God. The phrase <em>a wicked heart of unbelief</em> indicates that it is evil for a person to refuse to trust God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this part of the verse are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that none of you has an evil mind that does not believe in God<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See the Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in which his inner-being is not focused on his believing/obeying God<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See the Tagbanwa back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In other languages it may be more natural to refer to the person himself, rather than to a part of him. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that no one among you becomes evil and refuses to believe</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Don’t let evil thoughts or doubts make any of you turn from the living God. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you:</strong> The pronoun <em>you</em> is plural and refers to all of the readers and hearers of Hebrews.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>heart:</strong> The word <em>heart</em> refers here to a person’s thoughts, feelings and decisions. For more information, see the note on “harden your hearts” in 3:8a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>that turns away from the living God:</strong> The phrase <em>turns away from</em> is figurative. It refers to deciding to reject God. It does not literally mean that a person turns himself in a different direction. Use a natural way in your language to refer to deciding to reject someone. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that none of you turns his back on the living God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that is what will lead you to give up God who is alive without end</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that will cause him to reject/refuse the living God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the living God:</strong> The phrase <em>the living God</em> implies that God has always been alive, and he will always continue to live. He is the one who gives life. God is a living God, not a dead god. He contrasts with false gods and idols who have no life. The author described God like this also in 9:14, 10:31, and 12:22. Other New Testament authors also used this description, for example, Matthew 16:16; Romans 9:26; 1 Thessalonians 1:9.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate <em>the living God</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God who lives forever</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the life-giving God</p></blockquote>",

Some other ways to translate this connection are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Instead (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Rather (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages no conjunction is needed.

Believers must encourage one another so that we will resist sin, because we have become partners of Christ. Some English versions, including the BSB, leave the connection implied. Show the relationship between these verses in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>We have come to share in Christ:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>share</em> was also used in 3:1. The clause <em>We have come to share in Christ</em> means “we all share in the life of Christ himself.” This sharing includes all those who have become believers in him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we share in Christ (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Because as for us, Christ is our constant companion<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Tagbanwa back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>We:</strong> The pronoun <em>We</em> includes both the author and his readers.</p><h4>3:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>if we hold firmly to the end the assurance we had at first.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>if <span data-bnType=\"implied\">indeed</span> we<sup>(incl)</sup> continue to believe strongly until the end, just as we did at the beginning.</p></li><li><p>if we<sup>(incl)</sup> remain confident/firm in our initial conviction <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that Jesus is the Messiah</span> until the end <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of our lives</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if we hold firmly to the end the assurance we had at first:</strong> This clause tells the condition for 3:14a. We continue to share in Christ’s life <em>if</em> we firmly continue to have confidence in him. Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if we are faithful to the end, trusting…just as firmly as when we first believed (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if we keep till the end the sure faith we had in the beginning (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>hold</em> occurred in 3:6c with the same sense as it has here. The author wrote about perseverance at other places in the letter of Hebrews. See, for example, 4:14 and 10:23.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we:</strong> The pronoun <em>we</em> is inclusive and refers to the author and his readers and hearers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to the end:</strong> The phrase <em>to the end</em> means “to the end of our lives” or “always.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the assurance we had at first:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>assurance</em> was also used in 1:3, where it referred to God’s “nature” (what he is really like). Here it refers to the reality of the things which the readers strongly believed when they first committed their lives to Jesus. They trusted Jesus himself and they also had confidence in what they were taught about him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to translate <em>the assurance we had at first</em> is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>trusting God just as firmly as when we first believed (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>our initial conviction <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that Jesus is the Messiah</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the sure faith we had in the beginning (NCV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:14a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to change the order of 3:14a and 3:14b.

In 2:1–4 he gave a <u>first</u> warning not to refuse the message which Jesus brought. Here in 3:7–19 he gave a <u>second</u> warning not to refuse Jesus’ message, especially the “rest” that God offers through Jesus. The author quoted from Psalm 95, which says that God wanted to give the people of Israel a land where they could have rest from their enemies. When they were slaves in Egypt, he sent Moses to lead them to that land, but they rebelled against God in the wilderness. Then God did not allow them to enter the land of rest.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">It is often difficult to decide how to translate “rest” in this section and in chapter 4. Psalm 95 and Hebrews do refer to the time when Moses was alive and God promised to give the people of Israel land. However, King David was already in that land when he wrote the psalm, so the “rest” could not refer to the land. It refers to a different type of “rest.” That rest is a way of trusting God and depending on him for everything. We especially trust him to save us from our sins and give us eternal life. Because of the rest that God gives, we can have peace even when we suffer.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Be careful not to imply that the rest that God promises his people today is a certain place or land. Some scholars believe that the rest refers to heaven. It is true that we will have perfect rest in heaven, but Hebrews indicates that the rest that God provides for us begins on earth when we trust in Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Rest for God’s People</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Warning Against Unbelief (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We Must Continue to Follow/Obey God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Scholars differ about where to end this warning section.

In 2:1–4 he gave a <u>first</u> warning not to refuse the message which Jesus brought. Here in 3:7–19 he gave a <u>second</u> warning not to refuse Jesus’ message, especially the “rest” that God offers through Jesus. The author quoted from Psalm 95, which says that God wanted to give the people of Israel a land where they could have rest from their enemies. When they were slaves in Egypt, he sent Moses to lead them to that land, but they rebelled against God in the wilderness. Then God did not allow them to enter the land of rest.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">It is often difficult to decide how to translate “rest” in this section and in chapter 4. Psalm 95 and Hebrews do refer to the time when Moses was alive and God promised to give the people of Israel land. However, King David was already in that land when he wrote the psalm, so the “rest” could not refer to the land. It refers to a different type of “rest.” That rest is a way of trusting God and depending on him for everything. We especially trust him to save us from our sins and give us eternal life. Because of the rest that God gives, we can have peace even when we suffer.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Be careful not to imply that the rest that God promises his people today is a certain place or land. Some scholars believe that the rest refers to heaven. It is true that we will have perfect rest in heaven, but Hebrews indicates that the rest that God provides for us begins on earth when we trust in Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Rest for God’s People</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Warning Against Unbelief (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We Must Continue to Follow/Obey God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Scholars differ about where to end this warning section. Some scholars end the warning at 3:19. Others make the warning section continue to 4:13.

In 3:19 he stated his conclusion: the Lord did not allow the Israelites to enter the land where he planned to give them rest because they did not trust him.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In these verses the author answered his own rhetorical questions with other rhetorical questions.

This event was mentioned in 3:11: “So I swore on oath in My anger, ‘They shall never enter My rest.” (BSB)</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to translate what God swore in direct speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>To whom did he swear, saying, “Now you will never enter <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the land</span> that I wanted you to have as a place to rest with me?”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>swear:</strong> The word <em>swear</em> means to take an oath or make a binding promise. In Hebrew culture, such a promise must not be broken. Here God’s promise implied that he would certainly do what he said. What he said would certainly happen.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">You may be able to use the same phrase that you used in 3:11.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>that they would never enter His rest:</strong> The phrase <em>His rest</em> refers here to the life of dependence on God that God wanted his people to live. He wanted them to depend on him and trust him for everything.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">See the note on 3:11a–b. It is important to use the word <em>rest</em> here because the author is going to write more about <em>rest</em> in chapter 4.</p>",

Some ways to introduce this conclusion are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So we clearly know that…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>From all this we learn that…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Introduce this conclusion in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we:</strong> The word <em>we</em> includes both the author and his hearers. However, it is used here as a natural way to introduce a conclusion. In some languages it may be more natural to introduce the conclusion without using <em>we</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Thus it is seen here that…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>see:</strong> Here the verb <em>see</em> is used in a figurative way to mean “understand, know, learn.” Use a natural verb in your language to introduce the conclusion in this context.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it was because of their unbelief that they were unable to enter:</strong> The phrase <em>because of their unbelief</em> tells the reason that the people <em>were unable to enter</em> God’s rest. God did not allow them to enter his rest because they did not believe him. Some other ways to translate the clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>19b</sup>they couldn’t receive that rest <sup>19c</sup>because they did not believe</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>19</sup>the reason they were unable to enter the resting place God had prepared, it was their not believing in him<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to put the result of not being able to enter God’s rest before the reason (their unbelief). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>19c</sup>they were unable to enter <sup>19b</sup>because of unbelief (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>19c</sup>they were not able to enter God’s rest. <sup>19b</sup>That is because they refused to trust God.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they could not enter for lack of faith (NABRE)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a natural order in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>because of their unbelief:</strong> In 3:18 the sin of the Israelites was called disobedience. Here the author called it <em>unbelief</em>. Disobedience and unbelief are very closely connected.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to use a verb rather than a noun like <em>unbelief</em>. One way to express this meaning as a verb is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because they did not believe</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>they were unable to enter:</strong> The words <em>unable to enter</em> refer back to the phrase “enter his rest” in 3:18. It is clear from the historical context that “his rest” refers here to Canaan, the country that God promised the Israelites.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be necessary to say where the people of Israel were unable to enter. If that is true in your language, you should supply a phrase that will agree with how you translated 3:18. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they were not able to enter <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s rest</span></p></blockquote>",

God wants his people to rest from their own work, as God rested from his work on the seventh day after he created the world. In chapter 3, God promised the people of Israel a <u>place</u> to rest. In chapter 4, the author used a special time of rest as a symbol. This time was one day each week, which the people called the Sabbath Day (seventh day). Both the place and the time of rest are symbols of the rest that God’s people have when they depend on him for everything.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Two sentences in this section are especially important in stating this theme:</p><table style=\"min-width: 50px\"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>4:9</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>There remains, then, a Sabbath rest for the people of God.

We must be careful to believe and obey him so that we do not miss the life of rest that he promised. Some words that are connected to this theme in chapters 3 and 4 are “faith,” “believe,” “unbelief,” and “disobedience.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s people can still experience God’s rest</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We should trust God and receive his promise of rest</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1059004001\" data-endVerseId=\"1059004005\"><h3>Paragraph 4:1–5</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">At the end of chapter 3, the author indicated that the people of Israel whom God led out of Egypt refused to enter his rest (3:19). Chapter 4 begins by saying that God still offers that rest to people who believe him (4:1a). Connect chapter 4 with chapter 3 in a natural way in your language. Notice the examples in the note on “Therefore” in 4:1a.</p></div><h4>4:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Therefore, while the promise of entering His rest still stands,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ So while God still offers his promise about entering/receiving his rest,</p></li><li><p>¶ Now what God promised about giving <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his people</span> rest can still be fulfilled <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for us</span><sup>(incl)</sup>. Therefore,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Therefore:</strong> The word <em>Therefore</em> introduces the warning in the next part of the verse (4:1b). In some languages it is necessary to put the introductory word or phrase at the beginning of 4:1b to make the connections clearer. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But God’s promise that he has prepared a resting place for his people can still be fulfilled to us. <sup>1b</sup><u>Therefore</u>…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s promise of entering his rest still stands, <sup>1b</sup><u>so</u>… (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>while the promise of entering His rest still stands:</strong> The phrase <em>the promise…still stands</em> is a figure of speech. It indicates that God still promises to give rest to his people who believe and obey him. When the people of Israel refused his rest, he did not take away his promise to give rest to the people who were willing to receive it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And now, God still offers his promise that we may enter his rest</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s promise to give his people rest can still be fulfilled to us</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Languages have many ways to indicate that a promise made in the past is still valid, and it can still be fulfilled. Use a natural way in your language to translate that meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the promise:</strong> A <em>promise</em> tells a person’s intention to do something. It indicates that the person must do what he has said. Here <em>the promise</em> refers to what God said about his rest. He promised to welcome people into his rest if they believe. A promise is different from an oath, so you should use different ways to translate these two words.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>entering His rest:</strong> The phrase <em>entering His rest</em> is used as a figure of speech here. It means to begin to rest as God promised. This promise does not refer here to the land where God promised to give the people rest from their enemies. The <em>rest</em> that God now offers his people is a life of depending on him for everything we need.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is not natural to speak of <em>entering</em> rest. Some other ways to translate the meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>receive that rest (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>can be included in being able to rest under his care<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Tagbanwa back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>His rest:</strong> The word <em>rest</em> is the theme of this section. It should be translated in the same way throughout the section. The phrase <em>His rest</em> symbolizes dependence on God, especially for salvation and also for everything that he has promised his people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">A minority of scholars believe that <em>His rest</em> may refer to heaven. It is not recommended that you follow this interpretation or make it explicit in your translation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>still stands:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>still stands</em> refers here to a promise that is still valid.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See <em>καταλείπω</em>, meaning 4, BDAG, page 521. The word refers here to a promise that is still in force. People can still benefit from the promise.</span></span> In this context, it indicates that God still makes his promise of rest available to people who will receive it.

Interpretation (2) fits the context of serious warning,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Ellis Diebler (<em>SSA of Hebrews</em>, prepublication copy, page 16) points out that this interpretation “fits the theme of the whole book much better: Hebrews is not an encouragement but a series of strong warnings.” Miller (page 100) also takes this view, saying that it “fits well with the analogy being drawn from the experience of the children of Israel in the wilderness generation. Their repeated rebellion stirred God to anger and brought on an oath excluding them from the promised rest of God. They continued to exist until they died along the way, but there was no more possibility of entering. They were judged to have failed to enter. They were considered as having been already excluded.”</span></span> but no English version makes it explicit.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>none of you be deemed to have fallen short of it:</strong> This clause indicates that the author wanted every one of his hearers to receive the rest that God offers. He implied that it is a serious matter if anyone fails to believe God and then is not able to enjoy the rest that God promised.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that some of you might fail to experience it (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that perhaps someone will not be included in that rest</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>you:</strong> The pronoun <em>you</em> is plural and refers to all the people who hear or read what the author said to them in Hebrews.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>to have fallen short of it:</strong> The phrase <em>to have fallen short of it</em> means “to fail to gain or experience something because of one’s own fault.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span><em>ὑστερέω</em> meaning 1, BDAG, page 1043, has “to miss out on something through one’s own fault, to miss, fail to reach.”</span></span> The word <em>it</em> refers to God’s rest.

God wants his people to rest from their own work, as God rested from his work on the seventh day after he created the world. In chapter 3, God promised the people of Israel a <u>place</u> to rest. In chapter 4, the author used a special time of rest as a symbol. This time was one day each week, which the people called the Sabbath Day (seventh day). Both the place and the time of rest are symbols of the rest that God’s people have when they depend on him for everything.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Two sentences in this section are especially important in stating this theme:</p><table style=\"min-width: 50px\"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>4:9</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>There remains, then, a Sabbath rest for the people of God.

We must be careful to believe and obey him so that we do not miss the life of rest that he promised. Some words that are connected to this theme in chapters 3 and 4 are “faith,” “believe,” “unbelief,” and “disobedience.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s people can still experience God’s rest</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We should trust God and receive his promise of rest</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1059004001\" data-endVerseId=\"1059004005\"><h3>Paragraph 4:1–5</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">At the end of chapter 3, the author indicated that the people of Israel whom God led out of Egypt refused to enter his rest (3:19). Chapter 4 begins by saying that God still offers that rest to people who believe him (4:1a). Connect chapter 4 with chapter 3 in a natural way in your language. Notice the examples in the note on “Therefore” in 4:1a.</p></div><h4>4:2</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">The BSB translates 4:2a–c as one sentence. In some languages it is more natural to use more than one sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We heard the good news, as our ancestors did. But the message did not help our ancestors because they did not join those who accepted it with faith.</p></blockquote><h4>4:2a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:2a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For we also received the good news just as they did;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For good news has been proclaimed/told to us<sup>(incl)</sup>, just as it was to them,</p></li><li><p>For we<sup>(incl)</sup>, too, heard that good news, as our ancestors did.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For…also:</strong> This part of the verse begins with two Greek conjunctions that the BSB translates literally as <em>For</em> and <em>also</em>. Some versions translate <em>also</em> as “indeed” here, because it emphasizes the statement in 4:2a. The word <em>For</em> indicates that 4:2c will explain why the good news did not help the Israelites who heard it (as 4:2b says). Connect the clauses in this verse in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we…received the good news just as they did:</strong> The Greek phrase which the BSB translates as <em>we…received the good news just as they did</em> is more literally “we were evangelized.” It uses a passive verb form, implying that someone told the listeners good news.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In this context <em>the good news</em> refers to the promise of rest that God offers his people. It does not refer specifically here to the gospel of salvation through Jesus’ death and resurrection. The phrase <em>just as they did</em> indicates that the Israelites whom Moses led out of Egypt (3:16) were also told good news.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate the phrases in 4:2a are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use passive verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The good news was told to us, just as it was told to them</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use verbs that focus on receiving the good news. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We received the good news just as they did.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We have heard the good news just as they have.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use active verbs and supply subjects. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Someone</span> told us the good news, just as <span data-bnType=\"implied\">someone</span> told the good news to them.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate the verbs in a natural way in your language. A different form of the same verb is used again in 4:6.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we:</strong> The pronoun <em>we</em> refers to both the author and the readers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>just as they did:</strong> The phrase <em>just as they did</em> indicates that the readers and hearers of Hebrews received good news, just as the Israel people whom “Moses led out of Egypt” (3:16) also received good news. In some languages it may be helpful to refer to <em>they</em> more specifically. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>our ancestors</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Israel</span> people of long ago</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Refer back to them in a natural way in your language.</p><h4>4:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but the message they heard was of no value to them,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but what they heard did not benefit/help them,</p></li><li><p>But although they heard the message, it did not help them at all,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but:</strong> The word <em>but</em> introduces a contrast. Both the readers of this letter and their ancestors received good news, <em>but</em> their ancestors failed to profit from the good news.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the message they heard was of no value to them:</strong> This clause indicates that hearing the message without believing it did not help the people of Israel. Some ways to translate this meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they listened to the message but they received no help from it</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They heard his word but they gained nothing from hearing it</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the message they heard:</strong> The phrase <em>the message they heard</em> refers to the good news that was told to the people of Israel (4:2a). It was God’s promise that he would give them rest in the land to which he was leading them. Indicate clearly that the <em>message</em> and the “good news” refer to the same message. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>this message that they heard</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that good news that they heard</p></blockquote><h4>4:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>since they did not share the faith of those who comprehended it.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because they did not believe it and join/unite with the others who accepted it.</p></li><li><p>since they did not accept/share the faith of those who believed it.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>since:</strong> The word <em>since</em> introduces the reason that God’s message did not benefit the people of Israel.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they did not share the faith of those who comprehended it:</strong> There is a textual issue concerning the word that the BSB translates as <em>share</em>. The form of this word causes scholars to interpret 4:2c in different ways. The two textual options are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>In some Greek manuscripts the verb <em>share</em> is plural. The clause indicates that the people who did not enter God’s rest (3:19) did not “join&quot; with the people who listened to what God said. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they did not share the faith of those who did listen (NJB) <em>(BSB, NRSV, NJB, ESV, NASB, NET, NLT, NIV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>In other Greek manuscripts the word <em>share</em> is singular. The clause indicates that the message was heard but was not combined with faith in some people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it was not combined with faith in those who heard it (REB) <em>(GNT, JBP, REB, NCV, CEV, NIV84)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1). It is followed by many Greek manuscripts, including some of the oldest and most reliable ones.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Metzger (2<sup>nd</sup> Edition, page 595) says about this textual issue, “Among the bewildering variety of readings preserved among the manuscripts…the one that best explains the origin of the others is [this one]…Supported by early and diverse testimony representing both the Alexandrian and the Western types of text…, as the most difficult reading it would naturally have been altered to the easier nominative singular.”</span></span> However, many scholars also support option (2), and it is also acceptable.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Since both options are acceptable, you may want to include a footnote in your translation to mention the option that you decide not to follow. For example, the NRSV has this footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Other ancient authorities read: “it did not meet with faith in those who listened.”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>did not share the faith of those who comprehended it:</strong> This phrase refers to the time when most of the people of Israel did not believe the good news that God told them. He promised to give them rest in the land of Canaan. However, only Moses, Joshua, and Caleb trusted God to do what he said. The phrase <em>did not share the faith</em> indicates that most of the people refused to join the ones who listened to God and believed him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they did not join in with those who heard it in faith (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they refused to unite with the ones who believed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that good message</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>faith:</strong> In this context the word <em>faith</em> refers to believing the message that God was able to give the people rest in the land that he promised them. The people of Israel did not believe that this message was true. See the examples in the preceding note.

It often functions as a more general explanatory <u>link, marking a progression</u> to the next point in the discussion or argument. When <em>gar</em> has this function, the BSB sometimes translates it but sometimes leaves it untranslated, as in 5:1 and 7:1.</span></span> It also introduces a contrast.

The word <em>believed</em> is used in the same sense as “faith” in 4:2, and the Greek words are closely related.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is necessary to indicate what is believed.

Then he rested. God’s “work” came before his “rest.” He finished his work of creating the world a long time before the people of Israel made their journey to Egypt.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to translate <em>foundation</em> (“creation”) as a verb.

However, the author did not always talk about events in the order in which they happened.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In the Greek text, verses 4:6–7 are one long sentence, which begins with two connecting words, <em>epei oun</em>, “since therefore.” “Therefore” (<em>oun</em>) indicates that the following statement is a conclusion of the previous argument. “Since” (<em>epei</em>) indicates that statement is a reason for the following statement. These two connecting words also occurred in 2:14, and <em>oun</em> occurred again in 4:1. The RSV and the BSB reflect the structure of this long sentence exactly. The NIV omits both connectives.</span></span> In some languages it is more natural to use a different order.

He gives them as the basis for his conclusion in 4:7. In many languages it is more natural to have a word like <em>then</em> at the beginning of 4:7, rather than here in 4:6.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>Since</em> implies that the facts were already mentioned (in 4:5), and the author is about to repeat them. In some languages it may be natural to leave the connection implied. Some other ways to introduce the facts in 4:6 are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So we learned from this that…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>All this teaches/implies that…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So/Now we see/understand that</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Make these connections clear in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it remains for some to enter His rest:</strong> This statement tells what the first scripture in 4:4 teaches people. That scripture says that God rested on the seventh day. By that statement, God implied that his people may also rest. See the notes on 4:1a for more advice about how to translate this statement.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it is still allowed/possible for others to enter that rest</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>now <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> gives others the opportunity to enjoy that rest</p></blockquote><h4>4:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and since those who formerly heard the good news</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It</span> also <span data-bnType=\"implied\">shows that</span> the other people who heard the gospel which was preached to them in the past</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They</span> also <span data-bnType=\"implied\">teach that</span> the people who listened to the good news in past times</p></li></ul></div><h4>4:6b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and:</strong> The word <em>and</em> introduces the second reason why God set another time for people to enter his rest. That second reason contrasts with 4:6a, so some versions indicate that contrast with a word like “but.” Introduce this reason in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those who formerly heard the good news:</strong> The phrase <em>those who formerly heard the good news</em> is more literally “those-who at a previous time were-evangelized.” It uses the same passive verb (“were evangelized”) that was used in 4:2. You should translate it in a similar way here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those who earlier heard/received the good news</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those who were told that good message in the past</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>formerly:</strong> The word <em>formerly</em> means “first,” “in the past” or “previously.” It refers to the time when the Israel people were rescued from Egypt and God promised them rest in a new land. Some other ways to refer to this time are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>first (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in the past (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>heard the good news:</strong> As in 4:2a, the <em>good news</em> refers to the good news about the rest that God promised his people. It does not refer to the good news about Jesus. In some languages it may be necessary to refer to the good news more specifically. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>heard the good news <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about his rest</span><span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Western Bukidnon Manobo back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><h4>4:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>did not enter because of their disobedience,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>were not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">able to</span> enter <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that rest</span>, because they disobeyed him.</p></li><li><p>could not receive/obtain that rest, because they refused to believe/obey.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>did not enter because of their disobedience:</strong> This part of the verse has two actions:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>They failed to enter God’s rest.</p></li><li><p>They disobeyed God.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The second action is the cause of the first. In some languages it is more natural to change the order of these actions. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they disobeyed God and so were unable to enter his rest</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this cause and its result in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>did not enter:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translates literally as <em>did not enter</em> indicates that the people did not enter the rest that God wanted to give them. In some languages it is necessary to make this phrase more specific. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>did not receive that rest (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>did not get rest with God<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>because of their disobedience:</strong> The people of Israel could not enter God’s rest because they disobeyed God. Notice that in 3:19 the author said that the Israelites could not enter the land because of unbelief.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Disobedience and unbelief are similar. The Israelites did not believe that God was able to help them conquer the people living in the land, so they disobeyed God and refused to enter the land. Not believing God and not obeying him are sins. Both of these sins caused the people of Israel not to be able to enter the land.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate <em>because of their disobedience</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because they disobeyed God (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because they did not submit to him<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:6a–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be helpful to reorder some parts of this verse to make the connections with 4:5 and 4:7 clearer. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6b</sup>Those who first heard the Good News <sup>6c</sup>did not receive that rest, because they did not believe. <sup>6a</sup>There are, then, others who are allowed to receive it. <sup>7a</sup>This is shown by the fact that God sets another day… (GNT)</p></blockquote></div>",

God wants his people to rest from their own work, as God rested from his work on the seventh day after he created the world. In chapter 3, God promised the people of Israel a <u>place</u> to rest. In chapter 4, the author used a special time of rest as a symbol. This time was one day each week, which the people called the Sabbath Day (seventh day). Both the place and the time of rest are symbols of the rest that God’s people have when they depend on him for everything.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Two sentences in this section are especially important in stating this theme:</p><table style=\"min-width: 50px\"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>4:9</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>There remains, then, a Sabbath rest for the people of God.

We must be careful to believe and obey him so that we do not miss the life of rest that he promised. Some words that are connected to this theme in chapters 3 and 4 are “faith,” “believe,” “unbelief,” and “disobedience.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s people can still experience God’s rest</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We should trust God and receive his promise of rest</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1059004006\" data-endVerseId=\"1059004008\"><h3>Paragraph 4:6–8</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">It is important to notice that the clauses in this paragraph are closely connected. However, the author did not always talk about events in the order in which they happened.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In the Greek text, verses 4:6–7 are one long sentence, which begins with two connecting words, <em>epei oun</em>, “since therefore.” “Therefore” (<em>oun</em>) indicates that the following statement is a conclusion of the previous argument. “Since” (<em>epei</em>) indicates that statement is a reason for the following statement. These two connecting words also occurred in 2:14, and <em>oun</em> occurred again in 4:1. The RSV and the BSB reflect the structure of this long sentence exactly. The NIV omits both connectives.</span></span> In some languages it is more natural to use a different order. For examples, see the General Comment on 4:6b–8b at the end of 4:8b.</p></div><h4>4:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>God again designated a certain day as “Today,”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Therefore/So God appointed another day, which he called “Today.”</p></li><li><p>Because of this, God set another special time, and he called it “Today.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Remember that some translators begin this verse with a connector like “Therefore” or “So,” as in the GW. In the BSB, as in the Greek text, 4:6 and 4:7 are one long sentence. The Notes separates them into more than one sentence in the examples in the Display. Use an option that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God again designated a certain day as “Today”:</strong> This statement indicates that God appointed another time when people can enter his rest. The word <em>again</em> implies that he already set one time, which was for the Israel people whom he led out of Egypt. Now he sets another time. He called this time “today.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this statement are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So God set another day. That day is today. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>again he appoints/offers a certain time and calls it “today.”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is necessary to mention the purpose for which God set the day. God’s purpose was to give people the opportunity to enter (have) his rest. Some ways to say that are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>there is another time that God has given to people so they will have opportunity to enter, and now/today is that time.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So God set another time for entering his rest and that time is today. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>God again designated a certain day:</strong> The phrase <em>God…designated a certain day</em> indicates that God chose a particular time. The phrase <em>a certain day</em> refers to a particular time or to an opportunity. Some ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>there is still a time set by God<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Western Bukidnon Manobo back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he proclaims a further opportunity (JBP)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to use a present form of the verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>again he appoints a certain day (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God again designates a certain day</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a certain day as “Today”:</strong> Here the BSB puts the word <em>“Today”</em> in quotation marks to emphasize it. It also uses quotation marks because it occurs in the psalm that the author will quote later in this verse. These quotation marks are not part of the original Greek text, and some other English versions use different punctuation. You should use natural punctuation in your language here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the phrase <em>a certain day as “Today”</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a certain day that he calls Today</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>another day which God prearranged for people to enter. That day is called “This Day.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Yakan back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>“Today”:</strong> The word <em>“Today”</em> is used in part of Psalm 95, which he quoted in 3:7 and 3:15 and will quote again in 4:7e–f. The author emphasized this word <em>“Today”</em> several times to indicate that it is important for those who hear God’s voice to respond now. The time that he calls <em>“Today”</em> will not continue forever. Emphasize this meaning in a natural way in your language. Refer to the other notes and the Display of 4:7a for examples.</p><h4>4:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>when a long time later He spoke through David</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>After a long time, he spoke about this by causing David to say</p></li><li><p>He said this a long time after <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the Israelites came out of the desert</span>.

These words are from Psalm 95. They were written hundreds of years after Moses led the people of Israel out of Egypt.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God announced this through David a long time later (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>For a long time after the time of those first people who did not believe, God inspired His word in King David and David said<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Western Bukidnon Manobo back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a long time later:</strong> David lived many years after the Israelites traveled through the desert.

The clause <em>if Joshua had given them rest</em> implies that Joshua did not give the people the type of rest that God promised. If the people already had the rest that God promised, God would not need to promise it again.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this sentence are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We know that Joshua did not lead the people into that rest, because God spoke later about another day.

Many English versions leave it implied.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if Joshua had given them rest:</strong> Here the author referred to background information about 4:8a. Most people who heard or read Hebrews already knew that Joshua led the people of Israel into the land of Canaan. God wanted to give them rest there, but they disobeyed him. So they did not receive the true <em>rest</em>, which is a life of depending on God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate <em>if Joshua had given them rest</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>If Joshua had given the people the rest that God had promised… (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Now if Joshua had succeeded in giving them this rest (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">For more information about Joshua, see the OT book of Joshua, especially Joshua 11:23 and 23:1. God did use Joshua to give the people of Israel the promised land. But the book of Judges shows that they did not gain true rest because they did not obey the Lord.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Joshua:</strong> After Moses died, Joshua became the leader of the Israelites. It was Joshua who led the Israelites into Canaan, the land God promised them. See Joshua 1:1–11:23 to read about those events.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The name <em>Joshua</em> and the name “Jesus” are different forms of the same name. The KJV has the form “Jesus” in this verse to refer to the Joshua who led the Israelites into Canaan. It is recommended that you spell the names <em>Joshua</em> and “Jesus” differently so that readers will not become confused.</p><h4>4:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>God would not have spoken later about another day.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>God would not speak later about a future/different day <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when they will enter it</span>.</p></li><li><p>after that, God talked about another day <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when he will give it to them</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God would not have spoken later about another day:</strong> Here the author implies that sometime after Joshua died, God spoke again about another day when he will give his people rest. The author refers here to the quotation from Psalm 95:7b–11, where God used King David to repeat that promise about rest. King David lived hundreds of years after Joshua died.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>there would no longer have been any of God’s words speaking of another day</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it would not be necessary for God to tell us again about a different <span data-bnType=\"implied\">future</span> time</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>about another day:</strong> In this context, the phrase <em>about another day</em> refers to another time for people to have the opportunity to obtain God’s rest.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:6b–8b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is more natural to combine verses 4:6b–8b to tell the events in the order that they happened.

This noun is related to the verb <em>shaḇaṯ</em> which means “cease from, rest.” The Jews had to “cease” work on the seventh day and “rest,” as God did after his work of creation.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are two main views about what this <em>Sabbath rest</em> refers to:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to a spiritual rest that begins on earth when a person believes in Christ. Then the person depends on God for salvation and for the strength to do God’s will.</p></li><li><p>It refers to rest in heaven with God after a believer in Christ dies.

It can also refer to people who share a common culture but are not related by blood. God created everyone, so all people belong to him.

Connect the explanation to 4:9 in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>whoever enters God’s rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from His:</strong> The phrase <em>God’s rest</em> refers to the rest that God offers to his people. The author compares that rest to God’s rest on the Sabbath after he created the world. There are two main ways to interpret the phrase <em>rests from his own work</em> here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means that God’s people should not try to earn God’s approval by doing certain actions that they themselves decide to do.</p></li><li><p>It means that God’s people will not work after they “enter God’s rest” by dying and going to heaven.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). English versions are ambiguous, but the theme of Hebrews supports interpretation (1). The author did not want his hearers to try to earn God’s approval by their own sacrifices or other <em>work</em>. He indicated that they must trust in Jesus, their great high priest. He made the perfect sacrifice to reconcile them with God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>whoever enjoys resting with God has ceased doing things <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to gain God’s favor</span> just as God ceased doing his work <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of creating everything</span>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Ellis Diebler, <em>SSA of Hebrews</em>, prepublication copy, page 20.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>anyone who rests with God stops doing special actions/work <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to earn his approval</span>. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">He rests from doing that,</span> as God rested from his work <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of creation</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>whoever enters God’s rest:</strong> The phrase <em>enters God’s rest</em> is also used in 4:1a, 4:3a, 4:5b, and 4:6a.

This command is similar to the one in 4:1 (“let us take care that none of you should seem to have failed to reach” his rest.) The author emphasized the command by saying it at the beginning of the section and repeating it (in a slightly different way) near the end.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">You should translate the two commands in a similar way. Some other ways to translate the command here are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Let us…do our best to receive that rest (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we must be committed/diligent to get that rest with God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Let us try as hard as we can to enter God’s rest (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that no one will fall by following the same pattern of disobedience.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that no one will fail <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to enter</span> because he refused to obey God like the Israelites did.</p></li><li><p>Do not let it happen that someone disobeys God like they did. Then he may become unable to receive/obtain God’s rest.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that no one will fall by following the same pattern of disobedience:</strong> This clause tells the purpose for trying hard to enter God’s rest in 4:11a. It indicates that if we do not strive to enter God’s rest (4:11a), we may disobey God and then fall (4:11b). Another way to translate the clause is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that no one will fall by following their example of disobedience (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that this clause mentions two actions: they may fall and they may disobey. The disobedience causes the fall, so in some languages it is more natural to translate the actions in a different order. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that no one will disobey God like they did and then fall</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>so that no one will fall:</strong> The phrase <em>no one will fall</em> is a figure of speech. The word <em>fall</em> refers to sin that causes a person not to receive God’s rest. It implies that a person may disobey God and refuse the rest that God offers him, just as the Israelites disobeyed God in the wilderness and did not receive God’s rest. That implies here that the person will fail to receive salvation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that no one among us will retreat from our faith</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that none of us will lose/reject <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the rest</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>by following the same pattern of disobedience:</strong> The phrase <em>by following the same pattern of disobedience</em> means “by disobeying God, as the people of Israel did.” In this context the word <em>disobedience</em> refers to refusing to believe God. See the note on 4:6c. This is the same word that the author used in 3:18 and 4:6c. In some languages it is more natural to use a verb to translate <em>disobedience</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>by following the example of those who <u>refused to obey</u> (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the same pattern of disobedience:</strong> The pronoun <em>the same</em> refers to the <em>pattern of disobedience</em> of the people of Israel at the time of Moses. In some languages it is helpful to refer to them more explicitly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>like the people of Israel disobeyed long ago</p></blockquote>",

These reasons are descriptions of the word of God. It is living, powerful, and discerning. It exposes a person’s secret thoughts. Introduce these reasons in a natural way in your language. In some languages a conjunction may not be necessary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the word of God is living and active:</strong> This statement indicates that God’s word has power to accomplish what God intends. God used his word to create the world, and he uses it to affect what people believe and what they do. Some other ways to translate the statement are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s word is alive and it does <span data-bnType=\"implied\">great</span> things.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What God says has power to do/accomplish <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what he intends</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the word of God:</strong> The phrase <em>the word of God</em> refers to what God says. It includes the Scriptures. It also includes whatever God says, whether it is spoken or written. Jesus is also called “the word of God” (for example, in John 1:14). Hebrews 1:2 says that God spoke in (or by) a Son. Some other ways to translate the phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s word/message</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Word that God speaks (JBP)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>living and active:</strong> The two words which the BSB translates as <em>living</em> and <em>active</em> have a similar meaning here. The author often used pairs of words with similar meanings to emphasize what he wanted to communicate. This pair indicates that God’s word has power to accomplish what God intends. God used his word to create the world, and he uses it to affect what people believe and what they do.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to emphasize the meaning in a different way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>full of living power (NLT96)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it is powerful and it has results<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that there are other pairs in 4:12–13. Translate these pairs in a way that will emphasize the meaning in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>living:</strong> In this context the word <em>living</em> is used in a figurative way. It means “able to accomplish things.” Here it does not refer to breathing or to having physical life. See the preceding note for translation examples.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>active:</strong> Here the word <em>active</em> means “effective.” It indicates that God’s word accomplishes what he intends.</p><h4>4:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Sharper than any double-edged sword,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It is better than a sharp sword with two edges.</p></li><li><p>It <span data-bnType=\"implied\">penetrates</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a person’s thoughts</span> more effectively than the sharpest knife.</p></li><li><p>will certainly be accomplished.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Sharper than any double-edged sword:</strong> This statement is a figure of speech. The author compared the word of God to a <em>sword</em>. A sword can be used to cut a person open, and then people can see what is inside his body. The Word of God can do this in a spiritual way. It can reveal a person’s mind and heart and cause him (or other people) to understand it. It reveals to a person what is right and what is wrong about his way of thinking.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this figure of speech are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s word cuts better than a sword that is sharp on both sides.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s word is like a sword with two sharp edges.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a simile and also indicate the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s Word <span data-bnType=\"implied\">exposes a person’s thoughts and motives,</span> just as a sharp sword with two edges <span data-bnType=\"implied\">cuts into something and exposes what is in it</span>.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without using the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s Word exposes our hidden thoughts/motives.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a natural way in your language to translate the figure of speech.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>any double-edged sword:</strong> The Greek word used here for <em>sword</em> occurs only three times in the New Testament. A sword (or “dagger”) is a long knife. The word <em>double-edged</em> indicates that the knife has two sharp (cutting) edges. A double-edged knife is more effective than a knife that has only one sharp edge. That type of knife can cut into something and divide it accurately into parts.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to translate <em>double-edged sword</em> is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a long knife with two sharp edges</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages there is an idiom to describe this. For example, in Hebrew the idiom is literally:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a sword that has two mouths</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>any:</strong> The word <em>any</em> indicates here that there is no sword (even one with two edges) that is more effective than God’s word.</p><h4>4:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>it pierces even to dividing soul and spirit,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It pierces/exposes the most hidden parts of his soul and spirit,</p></li><li><p>His words reveal what is in the heart/thoughts of a person.</p></li></ul></div><h4>4:12d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:12d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>joints and marrow.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">as a sword can pierce</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">even</span> a person’s joints and bone marrow.</p></li><li><p>They reveal his most secret motives.</p></li></ul></div><h4>4:12c–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it pierces even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow:</strong> This part of the verse continues to describe the word of God. In Greek the phrase <em>even to dividing</em> is literally “as far as (the place of) division.” It implies that God’s word enters even the part of a person where soul and spirit meet or where his joints and marrow meet.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a phrase like <em>to dividing</em> may wrongly imply that the Word of God separates a person’s soul from his spirit and separates a person’s joints from his marrow. For that reason the Notes uses the GW as the source text for 4:12c:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and cuts as deep as the place where soul and spirit meet, the place where joints and marrow meet (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(GW) and cuts as deep as the place where soul and spirit meet, the place where joints and marrow meet:</strong> The phrase <em>where soul and spirit meet</em> is a figure of speech. The phrase <em>place where joints and marrow meet</em> is also a figure of speech. No one can tell exactly where a person’s <em>soul and spirit meet</em> or where <em>joints and marrow meet</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Together these two figures of speech refer to every part of a person. Some other ways to translate this meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It penetrates even the inner-being and thinking of a person. Therefore no matter what a person’s motive is or what he intends, this word of God can reveal it.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It pierces into even our thinking and our purpose, and it shows us what God thinks about it.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>(GW) soul…spirit:</strong> In this context the Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>soul</em> and <em>spirit</em> have similar meanings. In many scriptures the word <em>soul</em> refers to the inner part of a person which thinks, feels, and makes decisions. The word <em>spirit</em> refers to the person himself, especially to the essential part of himself that is responsible to give an account to God. Here the words <em>soul</em> and <em>spirit</em> are used together to refer to the hidden part of a person, his thoughts, and motives.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate <em>soul</em> and <em>spirit</em> here are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>our innermost thoughts and desires (NLT96)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a person’s inner-being and mind/thinking</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions (except the NLT) use the words <em>soul</em> and <em>spirit</em>. See <u>soul, sense A1(a)</u>, and <u>spirit, sense A1(a)</u>, in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>(GW) joints…marrow:</strong> The word <em>joints</em> refers to the material in the body that joins bones together. The word <em>marrow</em> refers to the substance inside the big bones of the body. Another way to translate the literal meaning is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a person’s joints and the substance inside his bones</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here the phrase “the place where joints and marrow meet” is a metaphor to refer to a person’s secret thoughts and desires. It emphasizes the statement in 4:12c, which has the same meaning. In some languages the metaphor may not be natural, and you may need to translate the meaning in a different way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>every part of a person</p></blockquote><h4>4:12e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:12e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>It judges the thoughts</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>His word judges what a person thinks</p></li><li><p>God’s word shows whether his thoughts are good or evil,</p></li></ul></div><h4>4:12f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:12f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and intentions of the heart.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and what he plans in his heart/mind.</p></li><li><p>and it reveals whether what he intends to do is right or wrong.</p></li></ul></div><h4>4:12e–f</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>It judges the thoughts and intentions of the heart:</strong> Here the author says that the word of God (<em>It</em>) is able to judge people’s thoughts and intentions. This is figurative language. It implies that God’s word causes people to know how God wants them to think and act. When a person reads it, it teaches him whether his thoughts are good or bad. Some other ways to translate this statement are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it pierces into even our thinking, our breath, our purpose, and it shows us what God is thinking about it.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Western Bukidnon Manobo back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s word judges a person’s thoughts and intentions. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It exposes our innermost thoughts and desires. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to translate the meaning without the figurative language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God uses his Word to show people whether their way of thinking and what they intend to do is right or wrong.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>It judges:</strong> The Greek word which the BSB translates as <em>judges</em> can describe a judge in a legal case. However, it is often used in a more general way. Here it refers to the ability to distinguish what is right and what is wrong. People can use what God says to examine their thoughts and intentions and know whether they are pleasing to God or not.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>examines</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>discovers</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>causes…to be exposed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>thoughts and intentions:</strong> The words <em>thoughts</em> and <em>intentions</em> are used together to describe what a person thinks. The Greek word which the BSB translates as <em>thoughts</em> refers to “the process of considering something, thought, reflection, idea.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span><em>ἐνθύμησις</em> BDAG, page 336.</span></span> It occurs only three other times in the New Testament: Matthew 9:4, 12:25 and Acts 17:29.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word that the BSB translates as <em>intentions</em> is also rare in the New Testament. It occurs only once more, in 1 Peter 4:1. It refers to what a person thinks, his “thoughts, knowledge, and insights.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span><em>ἔννοια</em> BDAG, page 337. The two Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>thoughts</em> and <em>intentions</em> here both begin with the prefix <em>en</em>- and are related in meaning. Their use in this verse is an example of the author’s frequent wordplay.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate <em>thoughts and intentions</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>what a person thinks and plans</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>our thinking and the purposes in our hearts<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>of the heart:</strong> In both Greek and Hebrew the <em>heart</em> refers to the part of a person that thinks and feels. In some languages a phrase like <em>of the heart</em> may not be necessary in this context. The source of the “thoughts and intentions” may already be implied by referring to the person (or people) who think them. See the first example in the preceding note. For more information, see <u>heart, sense 1(b)</u>, in KBT.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:12a–e</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages you may need to make the comparison in this verse more explicit.

God wants his people to rest from their own work, as God rested from his work on the seventh day after he created the world. In chapter 3, God promised the people of Israel a <u>place</u> to rest. In chapter 4, the author used a special time of rest as a symbol. This time was one day each week, which the people called the Sabbath Day (seventh day). Both the place and the time of rest are symbols of the rest that God’s people have when they depend on him for everything.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Two sentences in this section are especially important in stating this theme:</p><table style=\"min-width: 50px\"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>4:9</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>There remains, then, a Sabbath rest for the people of God.

We must be careful to believe and obey him so that we do not miss the life of rest that he promised. Some words that are connected to this theme in chapters 3 and 4 are “faith,” “believe,” “unbelief,” and “disobedience.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s people can still experience God’s rest</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We should trust God and receive his promise of rest</p></blockquote></div><h4>4:13</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 4:12 the author said that God’s word is like a sword which cuts people open and shows what they are like inside. In 4:13 the author indicates that God sees every person and everything that he created, and he knows all about them. No one can hide anything from him, and everyone must give an account to him for what they do.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The statements in 4:13a and 4:13b are parallel, and 4:13b repeats the idea of 4:13a. The parallel parts are indicated here by underlining or bolding:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>13a</sup>And <u>before him</u> <strong>no creature is hidden</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>13b</sup>but <strong>all are naked</strong> and <strong>laid bare</strong> <u>to the eyes of the one</u></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>13c</sup> <u>to whom</u> we must render an account.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is more natural to combine these statements. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>13a–b</sup>No one can hide anything from God, and he is the one <sup>13c</sup>to whom we must give an account.</p></blockquote><h4>4:13a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:13a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Nothing in all creation is hidden from God’s sight;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Nothing in all of God’s creation is hidden from him.</p></li><li><p>God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">clearly</span> sees all that he has created.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Nothing in all creation is hidden from God’s sight:</strong> The word <em>hidden</em> refers here to something that is not able to be seen or known.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Louw-Nida, 28.68. <em>ἀφανής</em>, page 343.</span></span> The clause indicates that God can see everything and everyone that he created.

It indicates that God knows everything about every creature, just as people can see the whole body of a naked person. Even if a person tries to hide something about himself from God, God will still see it clearly. He will know all about it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>everything is uncovered…for him to see (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>whatever creature, it is as if they are all naked in his sight</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>exposed:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>exposed</em> occurs only here in the Bible. It probably refers to the custom of exposing the neck of a person or animal in order to cut his throat and kill him. Here the word is used as a figure of speech. It indicates that everything (and every person) is completely known to God, and God has power over each one.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The root of this word, <em>τραχηλίζω</em>, which only occurs here in the NT, is “neck” or “throat.” The picture seems to be of a victim, whether an animal for sacrifice, or a wrongdoer, whose neck is bent back and the throat exposed for cutting.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this figure of speech are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>exposed/clear</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>there is nothing of our thoughts closed to him<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He can always see anything that we are doing/thinking</p></blockquote><h4>4:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>of Him to whom we must give account.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and we<sup>(incl)</sup> must explain to him the way we have lived.</p></li><li><p>who will ask us to tell him about what we<sup>(incl)</sup> have done and thought.</p></li><li><p>and we<sup>(incl)</sup> must answer to him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>of Him to whom we must give account:</strong> The phrase <em>of Him to whom we must give account</em> refers to God.

Then another priest was chosen. Only the high priest could make atonement for the people’s sins on the Day of Atonement. The other priests had different duties.

He taught them that he is Jesus, the Son of God (4:14b). These teachings are the basis for what the author told them to do (4:14c). He told them to hold firmly to their confession of faith, because they know that their great high priest is Jesus the Son of God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate 4:14a–c are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So now we understand that we have a great high priest, Jesus the Son of God, and he has gone into heaven.

Then that description will connect with the description of the high priest in 4:15.

Some other possible headings are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jesus Is the Great High Priest (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jesus Our Compassionate High Priest (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ Is Superior to Other Chief Priests (GW)</p></blockquote></div><h4>4:15a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:15a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For our<sup>(incl)</sup> high priest has compassion for us in our <span data-bnType=\"implied\">human</span> weakness/temptations,</p></li><li><p>We<sup>(incl)</sup> have a high priest who is able to help us when we are weak/tempted,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> The word <em>For</em> introduces a basis for “holding firmly to our confession” of faith (4:14c). The author already gave one basis in 4:14a (We have a great high priest, Jesus the Son of God). He introduces the second basis here at the beginning of 4:15a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to introduce this second basis by referring back to the word “high priest” in 4:14. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Our High Priest (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And this Highest Priest of ours<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses:</strong> This statement indicates that our high priest <u>is</u> able to sympathize with us in our weaknesses. The two negative phrases <em>do not have</em> and <em>unable</em> (not able) emphasize the fact that our high priest <u>is</u> able to sympathize with us.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to translate the statement without using two negative phrases. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We have a chief priest who is able to sympathize with our weaknesses. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And this Highest Priest of ours, he knows how to feel with us in our weakness<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Emphasize this statement in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sympathize with our weaknesses:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>sympathize</em> occurs only twice in the New Testament. It means to “suffer with” or “feel with” people. It implies the type of sympathy that motivates someone to offer active help.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>sympathize with our weaknesses</em> indicates that Jesus understands the ways that we are weak in resisting temptations to sin. He feels compassion for us. He is able to help us, and he offers us help.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Koester (page 283) says, “Jesus sympathized with people by sharing their flesh and blood, suffering to deliver them…and offering help.”</span></span> Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>understands every weakness of ours (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>feeling our weaknesses with us (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>has compassion for us when we are weak/tempted</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>our weaknesses:</strong> The phrase <em>our weaknesses</em> refers to the ways that human beings are limited or inadequate. In this context it refers especially to being weak in resisting temptations to sin. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>our weakness because of our humanity<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Western Bukidnon Manobo back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>our weaknesses which lead us into sin<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Tagbanwa back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the ways we<sup>(incl)</sup> are not strong to refuse sin</p></blockquote><h4>4:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but we have one who was tempted in every way that we are, yet was without sin.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>since he has been tempted in every way like us<sup>(incl)</sup>, but without sinning.</p></li><li><p>For he has been tempted with all kinds of temptation just as we<sup>(incl)</sup> have, yet <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as for him,</span> he did not sin.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but:</strong> The Greek connector that the BSB translates as <em>but</em> connects the clause in 4:15a with the one in 4:15b. These clauses have similar meanings, and 4:15b explains more about 4:15a. In some languages, a connector like <em>but</em> implies too much contrast in meaning between 4:15a and 4:15b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If that is true in your language, some other ways to connect the clauses are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a connector which indicates that 4:15b explains or adds to 4:15a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>15a</sup>This High Priest of ours understands our weaknesses, (NLT96)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>15b</sup> <u>for</u> he faced all of the same temptations that we do, yet he did not sin.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Do not use a connector. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>15a</sup>We have a high priest who is able to sympathize with our weaknesses. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>15b</sup>He was tempted in every way that we are, but he didn’t sin.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Connect the two statements in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we have one who was tempted in every way that we are:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>tempted</em> can also mean “tested.” (See the note on 2:18a.) Scholars disagree about what it means here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “tempted to sin.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he was tempted in every way that we are (CEV) <em>(BSB, CEV, NLT96, RSV, GNT, NIV, NASB, ESV, NET, NCV, JBP, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “tested.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in every respect has been tested as we are (NRSV) <em>(NRSV, REB, NLT, NAB, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), along with most English versions and many Bible scholars. This interpretation fits the context of not sinning as a result of the temptation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>one who was tempted in every way that we are:</strong> This statement indicates that our high priest has been tempted in every way, just as every human being is tempted. That is the reason that Jesus, our high priest, is able to sympathize with our weaknesses.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The verb <em>was tempted</em> is passive, and the clause does not specify who tempted Jesus. Other verses in Scripture indicate that Satan tempted Jesus. Some ways to translate the passive clause are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he, too, has been urged to sin in all the ways that we are urged to sin</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a different verb that does not require specifying the tempter. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>our high priest experienced/faced all the kinds of temptation that we experience/face</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active verb and refer to Satan as the tempter. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Satan</span> has tempted him in every way like he tempts us</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this clause in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>in every way:</strong> The phrase <em>in every way</em> means that Jesus experienced all the same kinds of temptations that other people have. Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>all of the same testings we do (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>all the types of temptations that human beings face</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>that we are:</strong> The phrase <em>that we are</em> refers in general to human beings. (See the examples in the preceding note.) If you use a pronoun like <em>we</em>, it should refer to both the author and the readers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>yet was without sin:</strong> The clause <em>yet was without sin</em> is literally just <em>without sin</em>. It indicates that Jesus faced every temptation without sinning. The BSB adds the word <em>yet</em>, which is not in the Greek text. It makes explicit the contrast between Jesus and other human beings. Jesus did not sin when he was tempted, but every other human being has sinned.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>yet he did not sin (NLT96)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>except that he never sinned (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but as for him by contrast, he absolutely didn’t sin<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote>",

He is very kind,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Let us then:</strong> Here the word <em>then</em> introduces an exhortation that is based on 4:14–15. It is the same word that was used in 4:14a. Connect this exhortation with 4:15 in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Let us…approach the throne of grace with confidence:</strong> In this exhortation the author used a figure of speech. Literally, the word <em>throne</em> refers to the chair or seat on which a king sits to rule his people. Figuratively, the phrase <em>approach the throne</em> refers to coming to God by praying to him. The phrase <em>of grace</em> indicates that God rules with kindness and generosity. The author used the whole exhortation to encourage his listeners to pray to God <em>with confidence</em> (confidence).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we should come bravely before the throne of our merciful God (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>let’s come to God’s seat with confidence, knowing that he is gracious</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a translation like “come to the throne of God” may wrongly imply that a person dies and comes to God in heaven. If that is true in your language, you should translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>let’s pray with assurance to God, our gracious King</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>let’s come with confidence into the presence of God. He shows grace/kindness</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Let us…approach:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>Let us…approach</em> is an exhortation.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See also 10:22. We can approach God because of what Jesus, the high priest, has done. This is a major theme of Hebrews.</span></span> The English words <em>Let us</em> indicate that the exhortation includes the author. It is not a request for permission here. In many languages (as in Greek), words like “let us” are not needed because the form of the verb indicates who should approach. Another way to translate this exhortation is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we should approach</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>let’s come/pray to</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>approach:</strong> The verb <em>approach</em> is important in this context. It implies that God’s people can now freely come to God by praying. In the OT, no one except the high priest could approach the “mercy seat,” which symbolized God’s presence. Now because of Jesus, all of God’s people can come to him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>get near to God by means of praying<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Based on the Western Bukidnon Manobo back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>come into God’s presence</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>go/come to God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the throne of grace:</strong> The word <em>throne</em> usually refers to a special chair that is reserved for the king. It also refers to the king’s authority. The phrase <em>the throne of grace</em> is a figure of speech to refer to God himself. It indicates that he rules with grace and mercy. The term <em>throne of grace</em> is similar to the term “mercy seat,” which was used in the OT. It also symbolized God’s presence.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate <em>the throne of grace</em> are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God on his Seat in heaven<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span> <em>If you use this option, be sure that it does not imply coming to God in heaven after death.</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the figure of speech.

We come to him so that he will be merciful to us, and so that he will help us with his grace. Another way to translate this purpose is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that we will receive help and gracious kindness when we need it</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The context indicates that God is the source of the mercy and grace that we receive. In some languages it is more natural to make that explicit in this clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that God will be merciful to us and graciously help us when we are in need</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>mercy:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>mercy</em> refers to an act of kindness for someone in need. It does not refer only to feeling pity for a person. In this verse it refers to the kind of help that God gives to people in need. He heals them, forgives their sins, and provides what they need. He comforts and sustains them when they endure sorrow, danger, or persecution.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate <em>mercy</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>show kindness</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>have compassion/pity <span data-bnType=\"implied\">on us</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>mercy</em> occurs only here in Hebrews. For more information, see <u>mercy, sense 2</u>, in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>find grace:</strong> The phrase <em>find grace</em> refers to receiving grace. The <em>grace</em> is given by God, just as “mercy” is in the preceding phrase. In some languages a word like <em>find</em> may imply the wrong meaning that the grace was discovered by accident. The context indicates that God is the source of the grace, and this should be clear in your translation of the verse.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate <em>find grace</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>receive grace</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>experience grace</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>grace:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>grace</em>, refers to kindness or help that is given to people freely, not because they have done anything to deserve it. In this context, the word refers to God’s grace. He is good to people because he loves them. The people have not done anything to deserve his goodness.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate <em>grace</em> in this context are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>kindness</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>generous help</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In many languages it may be more natural to translate <em>grace</em> with a verb or verb phrase. In this context the implied subject is God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that God will <u>be kind/generous</u> to you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that God will <u>graciously help</u> you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">For more information, see <u>grace, sense A2(b)</u>, in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to help us in our time of need:</strong> The phrase <em>to help us in our time of need</em> means “to help us when we need help.” Some ways to translate the phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>whenever we need help (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and He will help us at the time of difficulties<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Western Bukidnon Manobo back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote>",

In this section the author gives more information about the high priests of Israel and the work that they did. Then he compares the work of those high priests to the work of Christ as our high priest. The main point of this section is that Christ is the high priest because God said that he is.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author mentions three facts about a high priest’s role and applies them to Christ:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>A high priest is appointed by God. The Scriptures show that Jesus Christ was appointed by God. In Hebrews 5:5–6, the author quotes Psalm 2:7 and 110:4 as evidence that God appointed him.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Lane (page 118) says, “The writer correctly interprets Ps 2:7 as a declaration of appointment…. The same emphasis is evident in the quotation of Ps 110:4.”</span></span></p></li><li><p>A high priest should understand and sympathize with the weaknesses of his people. In 5:7–8 the author talked about how Christ suffered and prayed to God with tears.</p></li><li><p>A high priest must offer a sacrifice to atone for the sins of the people. In 5:8–9 the author indicated that when Christ suffered and offered himself as a perfect sacrifice, he obtained eternal salvation for his people. This implies that he atoned for their sins.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek text for this section, the author usually used a pronoun (“he” or “him”) to refer to Christ. He referred to him as “Christ” only once (5:5), and he did not use the term “Jesus” in this section. However, in the previous section (4:14) the author used the term “Jesus, the Son of God.” Consider carefully how to refer to Christ in the verses where only a pronoun is used in Greek or English. You should use the term “Christ” instead of a pronoun in places where you think that the reader will be confused about who the pronoun refers to.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Remember to read the section carefully before deciding on a heading for it. Some other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jesus Christ is the perfect high priest</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God made his Son the high priest for his people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God declares that Jesus is a priest</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1059005001\" data-endVerseId=\"1059005004\"><h3>Paragraph 5:1–4</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">This paragraph explains the duties of a high priest. He must offer the people’s gifts to God, and he must offer sacrifices for their sins. He must also offer sacrifices for his own sins, since he, too, is sinful. He is a weak human being, so he is able to sympathize with his fellow human beings.</p></div><h4>5:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Every high priest is appointed from among men</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Each high priest is chosen from among other human beings and appointed</p></li><li><p>¶ Every high priest whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> selects for <span data-bnType=\"implied\">us</span><sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Israel people</span> is a human being <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like us</span>.</p></li><li><p>¶ Whenever <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> chooses a high priest, he chooses a human being like other human beings.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek text, this verse begins with a conjunction that is often translated as “for.” It introduces background information about the high priests of the people of Israel. The author gives this information because in 5:5–10 he will compare these priests to Christ, our great high priest.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Every high priest is appointed from among men:</strong> This clause indicates that each high priest is a human being like other human beings. The verb <em>appointed</em> is passive. It implies that God selects a person from among other people to be the high priest.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the passive clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it is from among people that he is chosen</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> selects him from among his fellow human beings</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>is chosen from among other people (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Every high priest:</strong> The phrase <em>Every high priest</em> refers to each high priest of the people of Israel. It does not include the high priests of other peoples or religions. In some languages it is necessary to indicate that the phrase refers to high priests of Israel.

When Jews spoke of themselves, they used the term “Israel.” Notice the final two examples in the note above, which correctly use “Israel.” For more information, see <u>Israel, Jew, Hebrew, the Circumcised</u> in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>high priest:</strong> The term <em>high priest</em> occurred first in Hebrews at 2:17. Translate it as you did there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>from among men:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>men</em> means “people.” The word refers to human beings, male and female (though the high priest was always male). He was chosen from among his fellow human beings. Some other ways to translate <em>from among men</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>from his fellow men</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>from among other human beings</p></blockquote><h4>5:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to represent them in matters relating to God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to represent them as they worship God.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> gives him responsibility for the people’s service/worship</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to represent them in matters relating to God:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>to represent them</em> means “appoint (assign) someone to be in authority.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See <em>καθίστημι</em> meaning 2 BDAG, page 492, “to assign someone a position of authority, appoint, put in charge.”</span></span> The verb is passive. It implies that God is the one who puts the high priest in charge.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>to represent them in matters relating to God</em> means that God gives the high priest authority to represent the people in serving God. The high priest brings the people’s sacrifices to God and communicates with God for the people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this part of the verse are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>is appointed to represent the people in the things/matters that God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">has determined</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> entrusts him with the work of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">serving</span> him in the name of the people</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to represent them:</strong> The phrase <em>to represent them</em> means “representing the people,” “for the people,” “for the people’s benefit.” The high priest had the authority to speak to God for the people. He also did other things for God as the people’s representative, such as offer sacrifices.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Greek text is literally, “for them” or “on behalf of them.” The author makes a contrast between <em>ex anthrōpōn</em> (“from men”) and <em>huper anthrōpōn</em> (“for men” or “on behalf of men”).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the phrase <em>to represent them</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>bringing the name of the people<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to be their representatives</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>matters relating to God:</strong> The phrase <em>matters relating to God</em> refers to matters that are related to God. In this context it refers to service to God. This service includes things that are done for God, to him, or with him, or things that he himself does. Here the author refers mainly to matters of worshiping God and making sacrifices to him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase was also used in 2:17, where the BSB translates it as “in service to God.” You may be able to translate it in a similar way here. However, it is a general phrase, so it may be translated in different ways to fit the context.</p><h4>5:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The high priest must offer gifts and sacrifices <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span> because of the people’s sins.</p></li><li><p>to offer gifts and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">animal</span> sacrifices so that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will forgive</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">their</span> sins.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins:</strong> This clause tells the purpose of appointing the high priest on behalf of other people. He is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices to God so that God will forgive the people’s sins.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this purpose are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that he may present their offerings and sacrifices to God to atone for their sins</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to offer to God the animals or other offerings that they bring so that God will forgive their sins</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to help others by offering gifts and sacrifices to God because of their sins (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He offers gifts and sacrifices to God so that God will forgive their sins.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>offer:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>offer</em> is a common word that often means “bring (or take).” In this context it refers to bringing something (to offer or present) to God. When an Israelite brought an animal or a different offering for God, a priest took the offering and presented it to God in the proper way. If the offering was an animal, the priest killed it. Then he burned all or part of it on the altar or in another special place.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate <em>offer</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>give <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sacrifice/present <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>take/bring <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages there are special ways to refer to making offerings to God. If you must use different terms for different types of offerings in your language, you may refer here to the type of sacrifice that requires killing an animal or bird. Use a natural way in your language to refer to a priest presenting this type of offering to God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>gifts and sacrifices for sins:</strong> The author connected the words <em>gifts</em> and <em>sacrifices</em> with two Greek conjunctions. This connection probably implies that both the gifts and the sacrifices are offered to obtain forgiveness <em>for sins</em>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Allen (page 315, Kindle edition) says, “The final phrase ‘for sins’ probably refers to both gifts and sacrifices since the two nouns are connected by the Greek particle <em>te</em>.” However, some scholars consider that the word <em>gifts</em> has no connection with the phrase “for sins,” implying that the gifts are offered for a different purpose. Most English versions are ambiguous about this. The NLT and JBP are the only English versions on TW that explicitly do not connect <em>gifts</em> with the phrase “for sins.” O’Brien (page 190) says, “The sphere in which the high priest represents men and women is ‘in matters related to God’…. This general expression is further explained in the words that follow, <em>to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins</em>. Although it has been suggested that the gifts are peace and cereal offerings, while the ‘sacrifices’ are animal sacrifices, the terms are probably being used synonymously, even as a fixed phrase for sacrifices generally (as elsewhere in Heb. 8:3–4; 5:9; 11:4; see 5:3). Thus, the prepositional phrase, <em>for sins</em>, qualifies the whole, not simply the latter term. The expiatory activity of offering gifts and sacrifices for sins was integral to the work of Israel’s high priest, and is central to the work of Jesus as high priest, as Hebrews will proceed to show (9:26; 10:12).”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>taking the gifts and sacrifices that the people bring and giving them to God so that he will forgive their sins</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>gifts and sacrifices:</strong> The Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>gifts</em> and <em>sacrifices</em> are similar in meaning. The word <em>gifts</em> refers to whatever people bring to the priest to give to God for them. The word <em>sacrifices</em> refers to offerings that involve killing an animal or bird as a gift to God. The people of Israel brought both animal sacrifices and other types of offerings to God.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Montefiore (page 93) says, “if sacrifice was at the heart of the Hebrew religion, gifts were at the heart of sacrifice. No-one could appear before God with empty hands; the gift represented the worshipper’s acknowledgment of God in His sovereign lordship;…The sacrifice must also be offered for expiation of sins.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Use appropriate words in your language to describe such offerings to God. Avoid words that refer only to offerings made to spirits, idols, rulers, or something else besides God. For more information, see <u>sacrifice, sense 1(a)</u>, in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>for sins:</strong> The phrase <em>for sins</em> implies the meaning “in order to atone for sins” or “to remove sins.” For more translation examples, see the first note in 5:1c.</p>",

In this section the author gives more information about the high priests of Israel and the work that they did. Then he compares the work of those high priests to the work of Christ as our high priest. The main point of this section is that Christ is the high priest because God said that he is.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author mentions three facts about a high priest’s role and applies them to Christ:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>A high priest is appointed by God. The Scriptures show that Jesus Christ was appointed by God. In Hebrews 5:5–6, the author quotes Psalm 2:7 and 110:4 as evidence that God appointed him.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Lane (page 118) says, “The writer correctly interprets Ps 2:7 as a declaration of appointment…. The same emphasis is evident in the quotation of Ps 110:4.”</span></span></p></li><li><p>A high priest should understand and sympathize with the weaknesses of his people. In 5:7–8 the author talked about how Christ suffered and prayed to God with tears.</p></li><li><p>A high priest must offer a sacrifice to atone for the sins of the people. In 5:8–9 the author indicated that when Christ suffered and offered himself as a perfect sacrifice, he obtained eternal salvation for his people. This implies that he atoned for their sins.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek text for this section, the author usually used a pronoun (“he” or “him”) to refer to Christ. He referred to him as “Christ” only once (5:5), and he did not use the term “Jesus” in this section. However, in the previous section (4:14) the author used the term “Jesus, the Son of God.” Consider carefully how to refer to Christ in the verses where only a pronoun is used in Greek or English. You should use the term “Christ” instead of a pronoun in places where you think that the reader will be confused about who the pronoun refers to.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Remember to read the section carefully before deciding on a heading for it. Some other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jesus Christ is the perfect high priest</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God made his Son the high priest for his people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God declares that Jesus is a priest</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1059005001\" data-endVerseId=\"1059005004\"><h3>Paragraph 5:1–4</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">This paragraph explains the duties of a high priest. He must offer the people’s gifts to God, and he must offer sacrifices for their sins. He must also offer sacrifices for his own sins, since he, too, is sinful. He is a weak human being, so he is able to sympathize with his fellow human beings.</p></div><h4>5:2</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He is able to deal gently…since he himself is beset by weakness:</strong> This verse tells the reason that human high priests are able to be gentle with weak people. The high priests are able to be gentle (5:2a) because they know that they themselves are weak and sinful (5:2b).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to change the order of 5:2a and 5:2b, so that the reason in 5:2b comes first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>2b</sup>Since he himself is weak in many ways, <sup>2a</sup>he is able to be gentle with those who are ignorant and make mistakes. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>2b</sup>Chief Priests are just human too, and they certainly also have many weaknesses. <sup>2a</sup>That’s why they know how to be gentle to take care of people who are not yet mature and who do not yet know the right way.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you put the reason first like this, it may also affect the first part of 5:3. You may need to repeat information in 5:3a. For an example, see the General Comment on 5:2–3 at the end of 5:3a–b.</p><h4>5:2a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:2a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and misguided,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He knows how to show compassion to people who do not know <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> ways and to people who are easily deceived</p></li><li><p>The high priest can be merciful to people when they do not understand <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s will</span> and do not know that what they are doing is wrong.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and misguided:</strong> This clause indicates that the high priest was able to be calm and moderate with those who were weak and ignorant. He controlled himself so that he would not become angry.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he knows how to be gentle/merciful towards ignorant people and people who go astray</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he can be patient with people who do not know <span data-bnType=\"implied\">how to do God’s will</span> and do wrong</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>deal gently with:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>deal gently with</em> occurs only here in the New Testament. It refers to treating other people with calmness and respect. It indicates that the high priest should control his own feelings so that he will be patient even with the sinfulness of the people. He should be gentle with them and not treat them harshly.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this verb are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>be patient with</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>treat with compassion</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>feel pity for</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>those who are ignorant and misguided:</strong> Here the words <em>ignorant</em> and <em>misguided</em> both refer to the same type of people. These people sin because they do not know the way that God wants them to live or they do not seem to be able to live that way.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>ignorant</em> indicates that the people do not know how to behave. The word <em>misguided</em> indicates that they live without knowing what they should do. They act without being aware of the purpose of those actions. The author uses these similar words to emphasize the meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his fellow men who do not know what to do, who are overcome by sin because they are not strong.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his companions who go astray who don’t know that what they are doing is not right<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><h4>5:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>since he himself is beset by weakness.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because he also is only a weak <span data-bnType=\"implied\">human being</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He knows that</span> he himself also has <span data-bnType=\"implied\">many</span> weaknesses/faults.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>since he himself is beset by weakness:</strong> This clause tells the reason why the high priest was able to help weak and ignorant people (5:2a). He could help them because he himself was a weak human being, so he understood the weakness of others.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>beset by weakness:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>beset by weakness</em> is more literally “surrounded by weakness” or “clothed with weakness.” It indicates that a high priest is affected in many ways by human weakness. The word <em>weakness</em> refers here to a type of weakness that makes it difficult for a person to do what is right. It refers to moral or spiritual weakness, not to bodily weakness.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the phrase <em>beset by weakness</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he also has faults.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he also is not strong/able <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to overcome all sins</span></p></blockquote>",

However, in the previous section (4:14) the author used the term “Jesus, the Son of God.” Consider carefully how to refer to Christ in the verses where only a pronoun is used in Greek or English. You should use the term “Christ” instead of a pronoun in places where you think that the reader will be confused about who the pronoun refers to.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Remember to read the section carefully before deciding on a heading for it.

It means “in the same way also.” It links 5:4 with 5:5: No one can claim the honor of being high priest unless God calls him (5:4). In the same way, Christ also did not take that honor for himself. He became high priest because God called him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to introduce the comparison are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>That is how it was with Christ (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In the same way, Christ (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Likewise also Christ</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Introduce this comparison in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ:</strong> For information about how to translate <em>Christ</em>, see the note on “Christ” in 3:6a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>did not take upon Himself the glory of becoming a high priest:</strong> The phrase <em>did not take upon Himself</em> indicates that Christ did not take the glory of being a high priest on himself. He was not the one who decided that he should be the high priest. As 5:5b indicates, it was God who appointed him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>did not choose himself for the honorable work of being high priest</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>did not decide on his own to take the privilege of being high priest</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>did not become the high priest by appointing himself for that honor</p></blockquote><h4>5:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but He was called by the One who said to Him:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But it was <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> who said to him,</p></li><li><p>God himself called/chose him, just as God said <span data-bnType=\"implied\">earlier</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and as it is written in the Scriptures</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but He was called by the One who said to Him:</strong> This part of the verse is more literally, “but the one who said to him.” The word <em>but</em><span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Greek <em>alla</em>.</span></span> implies a contrast with 5:5a (“Christ did not take upon Himself the glory of becoming a high priest”). It implies that someone else glorified him and made him high priest. That person was God. The BSB supplies the passive phrase <em>was called by</em> to imply that.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the contrast with 5:5a are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Refer to God <u>giving Christ the glory</u> of being high priest. This option supplies the contrast with “did not take upon Himself the glorify” in 5:5a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Instead, <u>the glory was given</u> to him by God, who said (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it was God who <u>gave him the honor</u> of being the high priest</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Refer to God <u>calling, appointing</u>, <u>or choosing Christ</u>.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but God <u>chose</u> him (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he was <u>appointed/called</u> by God</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Refer to God <u>telling</u> Christ. This option is a more literal translation of the Greek text. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It was God who <u>told</u> him (CEV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a natural option in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>who said to Him:</strong> The phrase <em>who said to Him</em> introduces a quotation from Psalm 2:7. The author also quoted this same verse in 1:5. Here it implies that when God said this, he was appointing Jesus to be the high priest. Some other ways to introduce the quotation are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God said to him (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God who declared to him</p></blockquote><h4>5:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“You are My Son;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“You<sup>(sing)</sup> are my Son;</p></li><li><p>“I am your<sup>(sing)</sup> Father,</p></li></ul></div><h4>5:5d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:5d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>today I have become Your Father.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and today <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I declare/show</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that</span> I am your<sup>(sing)</sup> Father.”</p></li><li><p>and on this day I give you<sup>(sing)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the honor/authority that you deserve</span> as my Son.”</p></li></ul></div><h4>5:5c–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Here in 5:5c–d the author quoted from Psalm 2, just as he did in 1:5. Scholars call Psalm 2 a “messianic psalm” or a “royal psalm,” because it refers to the Messiah whom God promised to send as king. God fulfilled these promises when Christ came to the earth many years later. Remember that the words “Christ” and “Messiah” have the same meaning. Translate this quotation in the same way as you did in 1:5.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You are My Son; today I have become Your Father:</strong> Christ has always been God’s Son, so this quotation does not refer to his birth. It refers to the time when God gave him glory as his Son. In the context it also specifically implies the honor of being the high priest for God’s people. Translate the quotation in the same way as you did in 1:5b–c. For more information, see the notes on 1:5b–c.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>You…Your:</strong> The pronouns <em>You</em> and <em>Your</em> are singular and refer to Christ, the Son.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I:</strong> The pronoun <em>I</em> refers to God.</p>",

Your priesthood is the type of priesthood that Melchizedek had.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">This part of the verse is a quotation from Psalm 110:4. In Psalm 110 its author speaks about the Messiah (Christ), so the psalm is called a “Messianic psalm.” It indicates that the Messiah is a priest and also a king. Psalm 2 (quoted in 1:8) is also a messianic psalm. It speaks of the Messiah as king. The book of Hebrews indicates that Jesus our Messiah is both king and priest.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek:</strong> Here the author quotes from the Old Testament. This quotation tells what God spoke to Christ. God spoke to Christ and announced that Christ is a priest forever with the type of priesthood that Melchizedek also had.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this statement are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You are a priest forever, in the way that Melchizedek was a priest.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You will be a priest forever, and your priesthood will be the type of priesthood that Melchizedek had.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>priest:</strong> The word <em>priest</em> refers to a person who speaks to God for people and makes sacrifices on their behalf so that God will forgive their sins. The author of Hebrews often uses the terms <em>priest</em> and “high priest” to refer to Jesus, as well as to other priests. The word <em>priest</em> is a general word, and it can refer to both ordinary priests and to the high priest.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate <em>priest</em> are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a descriptive term that focuses on the function of a priest. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>sacrificer</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>man/person who offers sacrifices to God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>one who represents people to God</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a local word for <em>priest</em>. This option fits best if the local word can be used in a general way to refer to any priest. Test the word carefully throughout Hebrews to be sure that it does not imply a wrong meaning. The word is more likely to fit if the duties of a local priest are similar to the duties of a priest of Israel.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">The author used the term <em>priest</em> in this verse for the first time in Hebrews. However, he uses the term often in chapter 7 and a few times in chapters 8–10. The term you use for <em>priest</em> here should be the same as the one that you use in the gospels, for example, in Luke 1:5. If possible, choose a term that can be used in both Old Testament and New Testament contexts.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>forever:</strong> The word <em>forever</em> refers to a time that continues and never ends throughout eternity. Here it refers to Jesus’ priesthood that will continue forever. He will always be a priest, so he is very different from other priests who lived and died. The word <em>forever</em> is similar to the word “eternal,” which is a key word in the book of Hebrews.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate “You are a priest forever” are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you will be a priest for eternity</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>As for you, you will be priest without ending<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Tagbanwa back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>there is no end to your being a priest<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Western Bukidnon Manobo back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in the order of Melchizedek:</strong> The phrase <em>in the order of Melchizedek</em> indicates that the priesthood of Jesus was of the same type as the priesthood of Melchizedek. It cannot refer here to a sequence of priests, because Melchizedek was the only priest of that type except for Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate <em>in the order of Melchizedek</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>like the priesthood that Melchizedek had</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in the tradition of Melchizedek’s priesthood</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>of Melchizedek’s type</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Melchizedek:</strong> This is the first time that the author mentions Melchizedek. Hebrews is the only NT book that refers to Melchizedek, but Genesis describes him as the King of Salem, and “the priest of the Most High God.” For more information about him, see Genesis 14:18–20. The author will compare Melchizedek and Christ in greater detail in chapter 7.</p>",

The main point of this section is that Christ is the high priest because God said that he is.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author mentions three facts about a high priest’s role and applies them to Christ:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>A high priest is appointed by God. The Scriptures show that Jesus Christ was appointed by God. In Hebrews 5:5–6, the author quotes Psalm 2:7 and 110:4 as evidence that God appointed him.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Lane (page 118) says, “The writer correctly interprets Ps 2:7 as a declaration of appointment…. The same emphasis is evident in the quotation of Ps 110:4.”</span></span></p></li><li><p>A high priest should understand and sympathize with the weaknesses of his people. In 5:7–8 the author talked about how Christ suffered and prayed to God with tears.</p></li><li><p>A high priest must offer a sacrifice to atone for the sins of the people. In 5:8–9 the author indicated that when Christ suffered and offered himself as a perfect sacrifice, he obtained eternal salvation for his people. This implies that he atoned for their sins.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek text for this section, the author usually used a pronoun (“he” or “him”) to refer to Christ. He referred to him as “Christ” only once (5:5), and he did not use the term “Jesus” in this section. However, in the previous section (4:14) the author used the term “Jesus, the Son of God.” Consider carefully how to refer to Christ in the verses where only a pronoun is used in Greek or English. You should use the term “Christ” instead of a pronoun in places where you think that the reader will be confused about who the pronoun refers to.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Remember to read the section carefully before deciding on a heading for it. Some other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jesus Christ is the perfect high priest</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God made his Son the high priest for his people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God declares that Jesus is a priest</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1059005005\" data-endVerseId=\"1059005010\"><h3>Paragraph 5:5–10</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">After the author described the call and duties of a high priest of Israel in 5:1–4, he applied this description to Jesus Christ in 5:5–10.</p></div><h4>5:7–10</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">The verses in 5:7–10 are parallel to 5:1–3 in the chiasm of 5:1–10. In Greek these verses continue the long sentence that began in 5:5. The sentence continues until the end of 5:10. Most versions divide these verses into shorter sentences. Connect the clauses in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">These verses describe a time or times in Jesus’ life when he prayed with great distress. Many scholars believe that the author referred to Christ’s prayers in the Garden of Gethsemane before he was arrested and killed. Other scholars point out that there are also many other times in Jesus’ life when he prayed in distress. God heard Jesus during all those times.</p><h4>5:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>During the days of Jesus’ earthly life,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>During his/Christ’s mortal life,</p></li><li><p>While he/Jesus was living as a human being <span data-bnType=\"implied\">on earth</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>During the days of Jesus’ earthly life:</strong> The phrase <em>During the days of Jesus’ earthly life</em> refers to the time when Jesus lived as a mortal human being. He was a person with flesh and blood, like other people on earth. He knew that he would die.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to translate <em>During the days of Jesus’ earthly life</em> is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>During his mortal life</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>While he shared in human weakness</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be helpful to translate <em>earthly life</em> as “life on earth,” as many English versions do. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>During his life on earth (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>5:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>he prayed with weeping and tears, and pleaded</p></li><li><p>he shouted loudly and wept as he earnestly begged</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>He</em> is a pronoun that is often translated as “who.” It refers back to “Christ” in 5:5 (5:5–10 is one long sentence in Greek), and some versions have the word “Christ” here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions supply the name “Jesus,” as in the NRSV. Such versions may refer back to the phrase “Jesus, the Son of God” in 4:14. In some languages it may be helpful to refer to “Jesus Christ.” Refer to him here in a clear way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears:</strong> This phrase describes a time when Jesus prayed earnestly to God. The description has two emphatic phrases: <em>offered up prayers and petitions</em> and <em>with loud cries and tears</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to change the order of these phrases so that <em>loud cries and tears</em> comes first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he cried out weeping, petitioning, and uttering his requests<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his tears flowed and he wailed as he prayed and begged <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>offered up prayers and petitions:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>offered up</em> can be used in a general way to mean “bring to.” It can also mean “bring an offering to” God. Here the author used it in a figurative way to mean that Christ’s prayers and supplications were like an offering to God.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span><em>προσφέρω</em>, meaning 2b, BDAG, page 886.</span></span> This figure of speech emphasizes that Jesus prayed earnestly.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He prayed and pleaded (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>prayers and petitions:</strong> Here the author used two words that have almost the same meaning. Repeating the meaning like this emphasizes it. It implies here that Jesus prayed very earnestly. In some languages it is more natural to emphasize the statement in some other way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>he prayed fervently</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>prayers</em> means “urgent requests to God to meet certain needs.” The word <em>petitions</em> means “requests to God.” It occurs only here in the NT. Some ways to translate the two words are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>prayers and requests (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>prayers and pleadings (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>begged God, praying earnestly</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>loud cries and tears:</strong> The Greek word that is translated as <em>loud cries</em> refers to “loud calls or shouts.” The word <em>tears</em> refers to water that comes from a person’s eyes in times of distress or strong feeling. Some other ways to translate the phrase <em>loud cries and tears</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>His tears flowed and he wailed<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Western Bukidnon Manobo back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>weeping and crying out loud</p></blockquote><h4>5:7c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:7c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to the One who could save Him from death,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>with the one who could rescue him from dying.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to help him</span>, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">knowing that</span> God had the power to save him from dying.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to the One who could save Him from death:</strong> The phrase <em>the One who could save Him from death</em> refers to God. In the Greek text it is emphasized. Scholars interpret the phrase <em>save Him from death</em> in different ways. The three main views are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “save him from dying.”</p></li><li><p>It means “save him out of death—to give him life again after he died.” (This happened at his resurrection.)</p></li><li><p>It means “save him from the fear of death.”</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions are ambiguous. God was able to save Jesus from death in every sense, because he can do anything. If you need to choose one of the interpretations, it is recommended that you choose either interpretation (1) or (2). Both interpretations are based on common uses of the Greek word that can be translated either as <em>from</em> or “out of.”</p><h4>5:7d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:7d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and He was heard because of His reverence.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And he was heard because he was willing to submit <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span>.</p></li><li><p>Because he devoted himself <span data-bnType=\"implied\">humbly/respectfully</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span>, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> listened to his prayer.</p></li><li><p>He submitted himself willingly <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span>, so <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> answered his prayer.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and He was heard because of His reverence:</strong> The phrase <em>because of His reverence</em> gives the reason that Jesus was heard when he prayed to God. In some languages it is more natural for this reason to come before the result <em>He was heard</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He submitted humbly to the will/desire of God. That is why God heard his request.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And because His respect for God was great, and also His obedience to the commands of God, God heard his praying.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Western Bukidnon Manobo back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>He was heard:</strong> The phrase <em>He was heard</em> is passive. It implies that God heard Jesus’ prayer. It does not only indicate that he heard what Jesus said. It also implies that God listened and gave Jesus the help that he needed.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate the phrase are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And his prayers really were answered<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Tagbanwa back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active verb and supply God as the subject. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God heard his praying<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Western Bukidnon Manobo back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>because of His reverence:</strong> The phrase <em>because of His reverence</em> indicates the reason why God heard Christ’s prayer. The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>reverence</em> refers to awe or fear of God that causes a person to obey God. It implies that because of Jesus’ respect for God, he submitted to God and obeyed him. This word occurs only here and in 12:28 in the NT, but it also occurs in other Greek writings.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because he honored God by submitting to him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because he humbled/lowered himself to obey what God wanted<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote>",

The phrase <em>learned obedience</em> does not imply that the Son was disobedient or that he did not know how to obey. It indicates that when the Son was a man on earth, he had to suffer in order to obey the Father. Then he learned the type of obedience that involves suffering or causes suffering.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be helpful to mention “suffering” before <em>learned obedience</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He, being Son <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of God</span>, still suffered. Through his suffering, he learned/experienced obedience.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but Son though he was, he had to prove the meaning of obedience through all that he suffered (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Even though Christ was the Son of God, yet in order that he might obey God, he let himself go through suffering.</p></blockquote><h4>5:8a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:8a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Although He was a Son,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> Son, but still</p></li><li><p>But even though he was the Son of God,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Although He was a Son:</strong> In Greek this phrase is more literally, “Though being Son.” It emphasizes Christ’s identity as the Son of God. It does not imply that there was more than one son. In some languages it is necessary to supply the word for “God.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But even though he was God’s Son (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jesus is God’s own Son, but still… (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>5:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He learned obedience from what He suffered.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>he learned to obey <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> by means of the suffering that he endured.</p></li><li><p>he suffered much and discovered how to obey <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as a human being</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He learned obedience from what He suffered:</strong> The phrase <em>He learned obedience</em> indicates that Christ learned (experienced) submitting to God even when the submission caused him to suffer. In some languages a phrase like <em>learned obedience</em> wrongly implies that Christ was only pretending to obey.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The note in the Uma back translation (TW) says, “in Uma to say ‘he learned to obey’ implies that he was just pretending or imitating.”</span></span> In other languages it wrongly implies that Christ was disobedient until he learned from suffering that he ought to obey.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If this phrase implies such a wrong meaning in your language, use a different way to describe Jesus’ experience of obeying God as he suffered. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he experienced the meaning of obeying God through/by what he suffered</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>through all that he endured, he realized the meaning of following/obeying God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he too underwent suffering, and he submitted to God like mankind<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>obedience:</strong> The word <em>obedience</em> refers to listening to someone (here, listening to God) and doing what he says to do. In some languages it is more natural to translate <em>obedience</em> as a phrase or clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to obey <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to listen <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and do as he says/commands</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>from what He suffered:</strong> The phrase <em>from what He suffered</em> indicates the means by which Christ “learned obedience.” He learned it by suffering and in the process of suffering. The phrase <em>what He suffered</em> is a general way to refer to all the pain, sorrow, tortures, and agony that Christ endured when he died to atone for our sins.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">For translation examples, see the first note on 5:8b.</p>",

In some languages, it is more natural to begin a new sentence at 5:9, as modelled by the BSB.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>having been made perfect:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>having been made perfect</em> is a form of the same verb that was used in 2:10. The verb has several meanings, which are based on being complete or mature. In this context the verb refers to being completely qualified. It indicates that Christ was totally prepared for the work of being high priest.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Jesus never sinned, so the phrase <em>having been made perfect</em> does not refer to being purified from sin. Rather, it refers back to 5:8 where Christ obeyed God, though it caused him to suffer and die. The phrase indicates that when Christ obeyed God like that, he became completely qualified to give his people eternal salvation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the verb in this context are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In this way, God qualified him as a perfect High Priest (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And then after he was completely prepared</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this verb in 2:10, and translate it in a similar way here.</p><h4>5:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He became the source of eternal salvation</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>he became the cause/giver of salvation that continues forever</p></li><li><p>he was able to save/rescue forever</p></li></ul></div><h4>5:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to all who obey Him</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>for all those who obey/submit to him.</p></li><li><p>everyone who <span data-bnType=\"implied\">listens to and</span> obeys him.</p></li></ul></div><h4>5:9b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey Him:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>source</em> can also mean “cause.” In this context both meanings indicate that Christ became the one who can cause people who obey him to receive eternal salvation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he became the one who can cause all people who obey him to receive eternal salvation</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>now he is able to give/offer eternal salvation to everyone who obeys him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>now he is the one who is able to save forever all who <span data-bnType=\"implied\">listen to</span> him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and</span> do what he says</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>He:</strong> Remember that <em>He</em> refers back to “Christ” in 5:5.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>eternal salvation:</strong> The phrase <em>eternal salvation</em> refers to salvation that continues forever. The word <em>salvation</em> occurred in 1:14 with the same meaning as it has here. You may translate it in the same way here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to translate <em>salvation</em> as a verb or a phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to save forever</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to rescue <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to live</span> forever <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with God</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">As mentioned in 5:6b, <em>eternal</em> is a key word in Hebrews.

In this section the author gives more information about the high priests of Israel and the work that they did. Then he compares the work of those high priests to the work of Christ as our high priest. The main point of this section is that Christ is the high priest because God said that he is.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author mentions three facts about a high priest’s role and applies them to Christ:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>A high priest is appointed by God. The Scriptures show that Jesus Christ was appointed by God. In Hebrews 5:5–6, the author quotes Psalm 2:7 and 110:4 as evidence that God appointed him.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Lane (page 118) says, “The writer correctly interprets Ps 2:7 as a declaration of appointment…. The same emphasis is evident in the quotation of Ps 110:4.”</span></span></p></li><li><p>A high priest should understand and sympathize with the weaknesses of his people. In 5:7–8 the author talked about how Christ suffered and prayed to God with tears.</p></li><li><p>A high priest must offer a sacrifice to atone for the sins of the people. In 5:8–9 the author indicated that when Christ suffered and offered himself as a perfect sacrifice, he obtained eternal salvation for his people. This implies that he atoned for their sins.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek text for this section, the author usually used a pronoun (“he” or “him”) to refer to Christ. He referred to him as “Christ” only once (5:5), and he did not use the term “Jesus” in this section. However, in the previous section (4:14) the author used the term “Jesus, the Son of God.” Consider carefully how to refer to Christ in the verses where only a pronoun is used in Greek or English. You should use the term “Christ” instead of a pronoun in places where you think that the reader will be confused about who the pronoun refers to.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Remember to read the section carefully before deciding on a heading for it. Some other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jesus Christ is the perfect high priest</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God made his Son the high priest for his people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God declares that Jesus is a priest</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1059005005\" data-endVerseId=\"1059005010\"><h3>Paragraph 5:5–10</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">After the author described the call and duties of a high priest of Israel in 5:1–4, he applied this description to Jesus Christ in 5:5–10.</p></div><h4>5:10</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In this final verse of Section 5:1–10 the author said that God appointed Christ as a high priest in the order of Melchizedek. In 5:6 the author quoted the words that God said to Christ at that time: “You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.” The author repeated what God said to Christ to emphasize the importance of Jesus being a priest in the order of Melchizedek.</p><h4>5:10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and was designated by God as high priest</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He was appointed by God to be high priest</p></li><li><p>God chose/designated him as high priest,</p></li><li><p>God is the one who made him high priest.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and was designated by God as high priest:</strong> The people of Israel had only one high priest at a time, and each high priest served until his death. Since God appointed Christ as high priest and Christ will never die again, he will be the only high priest forever.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The verb that the BSB translates as <em>designated</em> only occurs here in the NT. Its meaning is similar to the verb that is translated as “appointed.” The form of the verb is passive, but God is mentioned as the one who appointed Christ to be high priest.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the statement are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and God declared him to be high priest (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God appointed him to become the high priest<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>high priest:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>high priest</em> was used in 5:1, but the more general word “priest” was used in 5:6.

However, a few versions and commentators believe that it refers to a person, either Melchizedek or Christ.</span></span> at the beginning of the sentence to emphasize it. In some languages it is more natural to begin the sentence in a different way, as modelled by the BSB. In other languages it may be preferable to follow the Greek word order. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>About this we have much to say (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>We:</strong> Here the author used the word <em>We</em> to refer to himself, as was common for Greek authors. The word <em>We</em> does not include the readers, and it does not indicate that there is more than one author of Hebrews. In many languages it is more natural and accurate to use “I” here. See the examples in the following note on “have much to say.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>have much to say:</strong> In Greek the phrase <em>have much to say</em> is more literally “much (is) the word.” It indicates that the author wants to explain much more about Christ being our high priest in the order of Melchizedek. Some other ways to translate the phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>there is much to tell you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>There are many more things I would like to tell you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The author already said something about Christ and Melchizedek in 5:7 and 10. So in some languages it may be helpful to indicate that he has <u>more</u> to say about that topic. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>There is much more we would like to say about this (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>about this:</strong> The phrase <em>about this</em> refers to the topic that the author has been discussing in 4:14–16 and 5:1–10. That topic is that Christ is our great high priest and his priesthood is like the priesthood of Melchizedek (5:10).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to refer back to this topic are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Refer to the topic in a general way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>About this topic/matter</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Refer to the topic more specifically.

The reason is that they <em>are dull of hearing</em>. As a result, it is hard to explain the topic to them in a way that they can understand. Some other ways to translate this result and its reason are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it is hard to make it clear to you because you no longer try to understand (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it is not easy to explain it to you because you do not seem to really listen</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to change the order of the reason and result so that the reason comes first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But you don’t seem to listen, so it’s hard to make you understand. (NLT96)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>hard to explain:</strong> The BSB phrase <em>hard to explain</em> is one word in Greek. This word often refers to a topic that is difficult to understand in itself. However, in this context the author indicates that his topic is hard to explain to them because they are lazy in listening to it. They do not think about it carefully enough to understand it. Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>difficult to make it clear to you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>hard to make you know/understand</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>because you are dull of hearing:</strong> This clause tells the reason why it was difficult for the author to explain the high priesthood of Christ to his listeners. The reason is that they were too lazy (slow) to understand it. The word the BSB translates as <em>dull</em> means “slow/lazy” and is translated as “sluggish” in 6:12, but it does not occur anywhere else in the NT.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because you are so slow to understand (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you have become too dull/lazy to understand it</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages there is a figure of speech for this meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>your heads/ears have become too hard</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The author said this to encourage his listeners to try harder to understand what he wanted to teach them. Translate this meaning in a natural way in your language.</p>",

He implied that they had known about Christ for a long time, so they should be ready to teach others about him. Instead they still needed someone to teach them the most basic truths that God has revealed to people.</p><h4>5:12a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to reteach you:</strong> This statement implies that the listeners still did not understand basic truths about being a Christian. They had been Christians for a long time, so now they should be able to teach people about the Christian faith.

It does not imply that the listeners should have become professional teachers or teachers of other subjects. In some languages it is necessary to refer specifically to Christian teaching. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Now for a long time <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you have heard about Jesus Christ</span>.

It is a general word that can refer to anyone who teaches, either formally or informally. It was often used to describe people who taught about God.

When they joined the Christian community, they were taught the basic truths that Christians believe. Now they seem to have forgotten these truths, so they need someone to teach them again.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate 5:12b are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you still need to have someone else to teach you again<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Western Bukidnon Manobo back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you still have to be taught/preached-to again<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Yakan back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the basic principles of God’s word:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>basic principles</em> is more literally “fundamental principles of the beginning.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The phrase is more literally “fundamental-principles of the beginning.” The phrase “of the beginning” adds emphasis here to the basic meaning of <em>στοιχεῖον</em>, which is ‘fundamental principles” (meaning 1c, BDAG, page 946).</span></span> It refers to the simple truths and principles on which our trust in God is based.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">These principles are usually the first truths that people are taught about God, Christ, and salvation when they become Christians.

He compared basic teaching to <em>milk</em>. The word <em>milk</em> often refers to “breast milk” that babies and young children take directly from their mothers’ breasts. The author compared the teaching about Jesus being our high priest to solid food. It is a teaching for mature Christians.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages this metaphor may not be clear. Some other ways to translate it are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You are like babies who need milk and cannot eat solid food. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You still need basic/simple teaching that is like milk. You are not yet ready for the advanced teaching that is like solid food.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a more general comparison. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You are like a young child who can understand only simple teaching. You are not mature enough to understand more difficult teaching.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>solid food:</strong> The phrase <em>solid food</em> refers to food that must be chewed, like meat or vegetables. Small babies cannot eat that kind of food because they cannot chew it. Remember that the author used <em>solid food</em> as a metaphor to refer to the complex truths that he wanted to teach them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a word like <em>solid</em> is not necessary, because food already contrasts with milk. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You again want to be like babies who are nursing, and yet it is necessary that you eat food.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It’s as if you have become a baby who still needs to nurse, because he can’t chew food.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote>",

He did not imply that they should leave the basic truths and stop thinking about them. He meant that they should not be content with only those basic truths.

The NLT rendering is a little different from either (1) or (2), since it focuses specifically on becoming mature in understanding, which involves a narrower meaning than the general “go on to maturity,” and implies absorbing teaching that is for mature people in order to gain maturity of understanding. Looking at the English versions, interpretation (1) seems to have somewhat more support. However, the back translations on TW tend to favor interpretation (2). BDAG (page 996) defines it in this verse as “maturity in contrast to the stage of elementary knowledge.” Since there is little practical difference in the interpretations, it seems best for translators to follow the interpretation that communicates most clearly in this context.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate the phrase <em>go on to maturity</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>let us also learn the deeper teachings so that our faith will become mature.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>let’s develop/grow and become complete <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in our understanding</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>maturity:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>maturity</em> means “completeness, perfection.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span><em>τελειότης</em>, BDAG, page 996.</span></span> The word occurs only here and in Colossians 3:14.

He mentions them in three pairs:<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some commentators take the first pair in 6:1 (repentance and faith), as being the foundation, which is then expanded in the two pairs of items in 6:2.

He compared the elementary teachings about Christ to the <em>foundation</em> of a building. A foundation is its base and support. After the foundation is finished, the building needs walls and a roof. After a Christian has the foundation of basic beliefs, he needs to “build on” his faith by learning what mature believers need to know.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the metaphor are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a simile.

They have no value, because they do not please God. They cannot help anyone to know God and go to heaven. They actually cause a person to be separated from God, which is spiritual death.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate the phrase <em>dead works</em> are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Refer to them as useless actions.

After this warning (6:4–12), he will continue to teach them in 6:13–7:28 about the priesthood of Jesus and Melchizedek.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Remember to translate the section before choosing a heading for it. Some other possible headings are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Warning about abandoning Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not be lazy but become mature followers of Christ</p></blockquote></div><h4>6:2</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse continues the list of basic teachings about the Christian life.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse mentions four more topics that are basic Christian teachings. The phrase <em>instruction about</em> applies to each of these topics. Some ways to make this clear are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use an introductory phrase that obviously applies to all the following topics. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and other basic teachings like these:</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an introductory phrase or word before each topic or each two topics. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>teaching about baptisms or about the laying on of hands or about people being raised from death and the future judgment</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use more than one sentence to translate the topics. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They are taught to request to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and a…leader puts hands on their head. They are taught what will happen in the future. God will make dead people live again and he will punish forever people whose behavior is evil.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Remember that the author wants his listeners to realize that these matters are basic truths that new Christians learn. By now they should be mature enough to consider topics for believers who are ready for more advanced truths. They will continue to think about the beginning topics as needed, but they will already know the basic truths about them.</p><h4>6:2a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:2a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>instruction about baptisms,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We</span><sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">should know</span> the teaching about baptisms/washings,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Let us</span><sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">not keep studying</span> about ceremonial washings,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>baptisms:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is a textual variant here between “teaching”/”of teaching” with the UBS going with “of teaching” but it does not seem to make any significant difference in the meaning of the verse.</span></span> The Greek word for <em>baptisms</em> literally means “washings.” It is slightly different from the usual word used for “baptism” in the NT. Scholars interpret it in different ways in this context:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to Christian baptism and other types of baptism.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the teaching about baptisms (GNT) <em>(BSB, GNT, NIV, NRSV, CEV, GW, NCV, NET, NJB)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>It is difficult to be certain about which interpretation English versions follow. However, English dictionaries commonly list Christian baptism as the first meaning of “baptism,” so the use of the term “baptisms” tends to imply that there were different types of baptism.</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to ceremonies to make a person ritually clean. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>instruction about cleansing rites (REB) <em>(ESV, RSV, REB, NASB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers only to Christian baptism. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>baptism (JBP)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). In Hebrews the author spoke to Jewish Christians, who knew about different types of baptism and cleansing ceremonies. They needed to be taught the meaning of Christian baptism and how it is different from other types of baptism.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Cockerill (page 266) says, “One of the best suggestions is that the pastor uses the plural because he is referring to teachings that distinguish Christian baptism from various OT or contemporary Jewish washings.” The <em>Exegetical Summary on Hebrews</em> (Greenlee, page 190) says, “The plural implies a contrast between Christian baptism and all other religious washings known to the readers [NTC]. Instructions would be about how the cleansing by Christ’s blood, symbolized by baptism, now abrogated Jewish cleansing rites and also possibly instruction about the differences between Christian baptism, Jewish proselyte baptism, John’s baptism, and Jesus’ baptism, and the work of the Holy Spirit [EGT, Hu]”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be helpful to make the meaning more explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>teaching about the difference between the baptism of a believer in Christ and other baptisms</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>purification rituals and baptism</p></blockquote><h4>6:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the laying on of hands,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and about <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the meaning of</span> laying hands on <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believers</span>.</p></li><li><p>and about <span data-bnType=\"implied\">blessing people by</span> putting hands on their <span data-bnType=\"implied\">head</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the laying on of hands:</strong> The action <em>laying on of hands</em> has a special meaning here. It refers to a Christian laying his hand or hands gently on another person (usually on his head or shoulders) to ask the Holy Spirit to come to that person. In some languages it may be necessary to use a more specific phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the placing of hands on the head of a companion<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>about placing hands on the head of people to ask a blessing for him from God<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Yakan back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The <em>laying on of hands</em> was done for different purposes. At baptism, it was done to ask the Holy Spirit to be with the new believer and give him power to live for the Lord. It was also done when a person was appointed to do special work for the Lord or in order to ask for healing or for a special gift for ministry.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a phrase like <em>laying on of hands</em> implies a wrong meaning. For example, it may imply that a person lays hands on another person to harm him or restrain him. If that is true in your language, you may need to translate only the meaning of the action. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the receiving of the Holy Spirit<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Western Bukidnon Manobo back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><h4>6:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the resurrection of the dead,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We should also know</span> that people will rise again from the dead,</p></li><li><p>about God giving people life again after they have died,</p></li></ul></div><h4>6:2d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:2d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and eternal judgment.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and be judged with <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a decision that lasts</span> forever.</p></li><li><p>and that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will judge <span data-bnType=\"implied\">them</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with a decision that will continue</span> forever.</p></li></ul></div><h4>6:2c–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment:</strong> In 6:2c–d the author lists the final two basic teachings: After people have died, God will make them alive again, and he will judge them. His decision about them will be eternal. Some ways to translate this meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>dead people coming back to life, and eternal judgment (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God making dead people live again and making an eternal judgment/decision about each of them</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>eternal judgment:</strong> The phrase <em>eternal judgment</em> refers to the future time when God will judge all human beings. At that time he will make a decision about each person. His decision will determine what will happen to each one forever.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate <em>eternal judgment</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s judging of people which has no end to its result<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people will be judged and God will determine what will happen to each person.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote>",

The author intends that he and his listeners will become mature believers who understand what God wants them to know. However, he knows that they can only become mature if God allows it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is necessary to repeat some implied information from 6:1 to make the meaning of the phrase <em>this we will do</em> clear.

In 6:4–6 he warned that if people “fall away” from their faith, they bring disgrace to God’s Son. It is impossible to make them repent again. In 6:7–8 he compared faithful and unfaithful believers to fruitful and unfruitful land. Land that produces only thorns must be burned.</p></div><h4>6:4a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:4a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Some people cannot <span data-bnType=\"implied\">be caused to repent again.</span> Such people knew <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s/his</span> truth at one time</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">As for people who stop believing,</span> no one can make them <span data-bnType=\"implied\">repent again</span>. At one time, they understood the truth.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">The Greek begins this verse with a conjunction that is usually translated as “for” or “because.” In some versions, a conjunction introduces a warning. It is based on what the author said in 6:1–3 about becoming mature. In 6:4–6 he warned his listeners that if we do not become mature, we may “fall away” from our faith (6:6). When that happens, it is impossible to be brought back to repentance.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice that here a conjunction connects paragraphs (1–3 and 4–6), rather than sentences. In some languages a conjunction is not needed. It is often helpful to translate the two paragraphs before deciding how to connect them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>It is impossible for those:</strong> The phrase <em>It is impossible for those</em> describes an action that no one can do. No one can help certain people to repent a second time. Some other ways to translate this meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is not possible to help certain people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as for people who deliberately retreat from their faith, they can no longer be led back to repent from their sin<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that the second example supplied a phrase from 6:6 (“who deliberately retreat from their faith”).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who have once been enlightened:</strong> The verb <em>have…been enlightened</em> is passive, and it is used as a figure of speech here. It indicates that God caused the people to know the truth. In this context it especially implies knowing the truth of the Gospel that God revealed through his Son.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate the figure of speech are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a figure of speech in your language that has the same meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>their minds have already been illuminated<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Some people once had God’s light.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they understood the truth</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>once:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>once</em> refers here to the time in the past when the people understood the gospel. Some other ways to translate it are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>at one time</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>at one point</p></blockquote><h4>6:4b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:4b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who have tasted the heavenly gift,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and experienced his gift from heaven.</p></li><li><p>They accepted God’s gift,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who have tasted the heavenly gift:</strong> The clause <em>who have tasted the heavenly gift</em> means “and have experienced what God gave.” The word <em>tasted</em> is a figure of speech that implies a full experience. It does not imply that the experience is limited. It implies that the person has not only been told about the gift—he has actually experienced it. The meaning is similar to its meaning in 2:9, where the phrase “tasted death” indicates that Jesus experienced death fully.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>enjoyed heaven’s gift (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they have benefited from what God has given<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>experienced the gift from God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the heavenly gift:</strong> The word <em>heavenly</em> here is an indirect way to say “from God.” The word <em>gift</em> probably refers here to the gift of new life through Christ. God sent Jesus to save us from sin and to bring us into fellowship with God. In some languages it is more natural to translate the noun <em>gift</em> with a verb phrase or clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>what God gave</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">new life</span> that God gives</p></blockquote><h4>6:4c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:4c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who have shared in the Holy Spirit,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They shared in the Holy Spirit.</p></li><li><p>and received his Holy Spirit.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who have shared in the Holy Spirit:</strong> The phrase <em>have shared in the Holy Spirit</em><span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Greek phrase is literally “who have become sharers/partners in the spirit.” The author used a word <em>metochoi</em>, “partners” which he has used already in 3:1a (“who share in the heavenly calling”) and 3:14a (“share in Christ”), and which he will use again in 12:8.</span></span> indicates that they were among those who experienced the Holy Spirit’s presence and power.

It does not imply that the experience is limited like a little taste of food.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Languages have different ways to speak of experiencing something. They may use verbs that mean “see” or “feel.” There may also be different ways to speak of different types of experiences.

In 6:4–6 he warned that if people “fall away” from their faith, they bring disgrace to God’s Son. It is impossible to make them repent again. In 6:7–8 he compared faithful and unfaithful believers to fruitful and unfruitful land. Land that produces only thorns must be burned.</p></div><h4>6:6a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:6a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and then have fallen away—to be restored to repentance,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>If such people turn away/back <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from their faith</span>, they cannot repent again.</p></li><li><p>If they deliberately reject <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what they believed</span>, they are unable to repent again.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and then have fallen away:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>have fallen away</em><span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Greek verb is a participle, which is rightly interpreted in this context as a condition.</span></span> It is used only here in the New Testament. In general, it means “to fail to keep a commitment.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDAG, (page 770) has for <em>παραπίπτω</em>: “to fail to follow through on a commitment, fall away, commit apostasy.” Although BDAG includes the meaning “commit apostasy,” some other scholars disagree with that definition. In a lengthy discussion of the topic, David Allen (Kindle edition, pages 260–261) indicates that elsewhere in Scripture, the word is not used with the meaning “commit apostasy.” Instead, it means “turn away.” He points out that the author of Hebrews warns the readers not to follow the example of the Israelites (Numbers 14), who turned away from God in the wilderness. Although God punished them severely, he still considered them his people and continued to take care of them. Allen considers the penalty for this type of turning away to be temporal punishment and loss of rewards. No amount of regret will change the results of that turning away, but he believes that the results do not involve eternal loss of salvation.</span></span> There are different ways to interpret the word in this context. The most likely view is that it refers here to a person refusing to keep the commitment to follow Jesus. It implies a deliberate action.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this part of the verse are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if they deliberately retreat from their faith<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and then they refuse to continue believing</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In many languages it is natural to translate the meaning with a figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>turn away from God (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they have deserted <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ</span> (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to be restored to repentance:</strong> The verb that the BSB translates as <em>restored</em> means “renew.” It occurs only here in the NT. This is the main verb that follows “it is impossible” in 6:4a. The author indicated that it is impossible to renew/restore some people to repentance. In this context it indicates that it is impossible to cause some people to repent a second time. These are the people who trusted Jesus to save them from their sins but after that, they decided not to trust him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this passive verb are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>be led a second time to God (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to bring them back to a changed life again (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to make them repent as they did at first (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>cause them to repent again</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>repentance:</strong> The word <em>repentance</em> occurred in 6:1d. You should translate it in a similar way here.</p><h4>6:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because they themselves are crucifying the Son of God all over again</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They themselves are nailing the Son of God to a cross again to be crucified</p></li><li><p>It is as if they themselves are nailing the Son of God to the cross to die again.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because they themselves are crucifying the Son of God all over again:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The word <em>because</em> indicates the reason or explanation why they cannot repent. In Greek, the verb is a participle without any connective, as was the condition in 6:6a.</span></span> This is figurative language. When people reject the Son of God, it is like crucifying him again. They refuse to believe that he is God’s Son and that he can save them from their sins. Rejecting him is their greatest sin. That is why it is impossible for them to repent while they are rejecting him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The meaning here is similar to the action “turns away from the living God” in 3:12. Some other ways to translate it are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it’s as if they are again nailing God’s Son to the cross</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>what they have done is like they nailed the Son of God to the cross with their own hands</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>they themselves:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>they themselves</em> is more literally “to/for themselves.” Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they again crucify <u>to themselves</u> the Son of God (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">There are three main ways to interpret the word “for themselves” here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means that they themselves crucify God’s Son. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they themselves are nailing him to the cross once again (NLT) <em>(BSB, NET, NLT, JBP, NRSV, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “to their own loss.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for they are crucifying to their own hurt the Son of God (REB) <em>(NIV, ESV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It adds emphasis and does not need to be translated specifically. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because they are nailing the Son of God to a cross again and are shaming him in front of others (NCV) <em>(NCV, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). The author emphasizes that they themselves commit the same sin of rejecting Christ that the people who crucified him committed. They were not present at Christ’s crucifixion, but they figuratively crucify him again by rejecting him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Son of God:</strong> The title <em>the Son of God</em> indicates that Jesus has the same nature and character as God. See how you translated <em>the Son of God</em> at 4:14. For more information, see the note on “his Son” in 1:2a.</p><h4>6:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and subjecting Him to open shame.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and openly/publicly dishonor him.</p></li><li><p>They bring public shame to him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by saying that Christ is not important</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and subjecting Him to open shame:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>subjecting Him to open shame</em> was most often used of shaming a person by punishing him in public. Here it indicates that if people claim to be Christians and then reject Christ, they disgrace him and cause other people also to dishonor him. Some other ways to translate this meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>insulting him in public (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They cause that all the people make fun of him again.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This word occurs only here in the NT. However, in other literature it is used to refer to shaming a criminal by punishing him in public. A related word occurs in Matthew 1:19.</p>",

In some languages it is necessary to make the comparison explicit. This may be done either at the beginning of the verse or at its end. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other people are like</span> land that produces only thorns and thistles…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…This represents the people whom God will punish.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><h4>6:8a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:8a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>However, other land <span data-bnType=\"implied\">also receives rain, but it</span> produces <span data-bnType=\"implied\">only</span> thorny weeds.

In 6:8 the land produces useless plants like thorns and thistles and must be burned. The author implies that this land is like people who fall away from Christ (6:4–6). Translate the contrast in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless:</strong> Here the author refers to land where nothing grows except thorns and thistles. As in 6:7, in some languages it may not be natural to speak of land “producing” plants. Translate this meaning in a similar way as you did in 6:7. Some other ways to translate it are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But the bad soil where weeds and thorns grow is useless.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But if that land has nothing growing on it but thorns and thistles it has no value</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>thorns and thistles:</strong> The words <em>thorns and thistles</em> refer to the most common weeds in Israel. Thorn bushes and thistle plants are not useful for anything. Even most animals will not eat them. It is fine to translate the phrase <em>thorns and thistles</em> with similar useless, thorny weeds that are found in your area or with general terms.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>nothing but sword-grass and thorns growing on it<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>weeds and thorny plants<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Tagbanwa back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">These two types of plants are very similar. The word <em>thorns</em> refers to “plants that have thorns.” Thorns are sharp spikes that can hurt someone who touches them. The word <em>thistles</em> refers to prickly weeds. This word only occurs here and in Matthew 7:16. The author probably mentioned both of these plants to emphasize his meaning. In some languages it may be more natural to emphasize the meaning in a different way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>only thornbushes (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>only useless/harmful plants</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>only weeds</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Both words occur in Matthew 7:16. See how you translated them there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>is worthless:</strong> The word <em>worthless</em> indicates here that the land produces nothing of value. It is barren, and its owners do not get anything good from it. The author implies that it is like the people who go away from Christ. They cannot do anything good to please God. Other ways to translate this meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>has no use/value</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>is worth nothing</p></blockquote><h4>6:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and its curse is imminent.

It is supported by more English versions and commentaries.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>its curse:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>its curse</em> refers here to a decision that God may make to condemn the people who are like the worthless land. When God speaks the condemnation (curse), it is a judgment that cannot be avoided.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some cultures the meaning of <em>curse</em> is different from the biblical meaning here. If that is true in your culture you may have to use a different word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>being judged/condemned</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>being punished/destroyed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The text strongly implies that God is the one who will punish the land (people). In some languages it is necessary to make that explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>being cursed/punished by God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> may soon condemn it.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>In the end it will be burned:</strong> In Greek this clause is more literally “its end [is] for burning.” It means that, finally, the land will be burned. This implies that fire will burn all the plants on the land. (It does not imply that the land itself will burn.) In many places in the world, it is common to burn a field to prepare it for planting.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>finally, it will be burned</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in the end, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the farmer</span> must burn the weeds off of it</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is necessary to make the meaning more explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it’s burned over by the owner. And the same way also, the person like this land, he will be punished by God.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Western Bukidnon Manobo back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:7–8</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Paragraph 6:7–8 compares soil and people. In some languages it is necessary to make the comparison more explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7</sup>Some people are like land that gets plenty of rain. The land produces a good crop for those who work it, and it receives God’s blessings. <sup>8</sup>Other people are like land that grows thorns and weeds and is worthless.

After this warning (6:4–12), he will continue to teach them in 6:13–7:28 about the priesthood of Jesus and Melchizedek.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Remember to translate the section before choosing a heading for it. Some other possible headings are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Warning about abandoning Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not be lazy but become mature followers of Christ</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1059006009\" data-endVerseId=\"1059006012\"><h3>Paragraph 6:9–12</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">This paragraph is an obvious contrast to 6:7–8. In 6:7–8 the author sternly warned his readers that they must not give up their faith in Christ. Here in 6:9–12 he assured them that he believed better things about them. He encouraged them not to become lazy but to keep trusting Christ so that they will obtain all that Christ promised.</p></div><h4>6:9a–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Even though we speak like this, beloved, we are convinced of better things in your case—things that accompany salvation:</strong> The Greek text uses a different order of clauses than most English versions. It is more literally:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But we are convinced about you, beloved, of better things and things belonging to salvation, though thus we speak.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use the order of clauses that is most natural in your language here. See the General Comment on 6:9a–c at the end of 6:9b–c for more information.</p><h4>6:9a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:9a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Even though we speak like this, beloved,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Dear friends, even though we<sup>(excl)</sup> are talking to you<sup>(plur)</sup> like this,</p></li><li><p>¶ I speak <span data-bnType=\"implied\">severely</span> like this to you<sup>(plur)</sup>, but I love you,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Even though we speak like this, beloved:</strong> Here the author introduces a contrast to what he said in 5:11–6:8. In 5:11–14 he told the listeners that they were still immature. Then in 6:1–8 he told them that it is a terrible sin to stop believing in Christ. Here in 6:9 he will begin to encourage them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to introduce this contrast and encouragement are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But even if we speak like this, dear friends (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>My friends, we are talking this way. But (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Yet although we speak as we do, we are convinced that you, dear friends (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that English versions translate the word <em>beloved</em> in different places in the sentence. In many languages it is most natural to put such a direct address at the beginning of the sentence. Do what is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we speak like this:</strong> The clause <em>we speak like this</em> implies that the author spoke sternly to his listeners (in 5:11–6:8). He warned them severely. He seemed to imply that maybe they had stopped believing in Christ. In some languages it may be necessary to make the meaning more explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Although we have spoken so sternly</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We have warned you like this, but</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>we:</strong> The author used the word <em>we</em> here to refer only to himself. In some languages it is more natural to make that clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>even though my words to you are like this<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Western Bukidnon Manobo back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>even though I am speaking like this<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Yakan back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>beloved:</strong> After the severe words of the previous verses, the author addressed his listeners in a loving way. He called them <em>beloved</em><span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>He did not use vocatives often in this letter. The only other places are in 3:1a (“holy brothers”), and in 3:12a; 10:19; and 13:22 (“brothers”).</span></span> because he still loved them and considered them to be his fellow Christians. In some languages it is more natural to use a different phrase. Some languages use kinship terms or other terms for fellow believers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you relatives whom we love<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>my dear friends/brothers</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In other languages it may be more natural to translate the meaning <em>beloved</em> as a phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Although we are talking to you like this, <u>we/I love you</u></p></blockquote><h4>6:9b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we are convinced of better things in your case—things that accompany salvation:</strong> Here the author assured his listeners that he believed <em>better things</em> about them than the things he described in 6:1–8. There he described people who were going away from Christ. Here he indicates that he did not believe that his listeners were going away from Christ like that. He believed that they were receiving the blessings of salvation and doing the good things that saved people do.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we are convinced of better things concerning you—things that accompany salvation (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We are confident that you are meant for better things, things that come with salvation (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>better things…that accompany salvation:</strong> The phrase <em>better things…that accompany salvation</em> refers to at least two types of <em>better things</em>:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to good things that saved people do. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But we are sure that you are doing those really good things that people do when they are…saved (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to good things that God does for people who are saved. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We know that you have the better blessings that belong to your salvation. (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to focus on one of these types of <em>better things</em> rather than to try to mention them both. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We know that you have better fruit…that is fitting for those who have obtained salvation from God.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate in a way that is natural in your language.</p><h4>6:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>we are convinced of better things in your case—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>we<sup>(excl)</sup> believe much better things about you<sup>(plur)</sup>,</p></li><li><p>and I believe that you<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">are not like that useless land, but</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">your faith has</span> good results/fruits,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>better:</strong> The word <em>better</em> is one of the key words in Hebrews. It may be helpful to translate this word the same way whenever it occurs.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in your case:</strong> The phrase translated as <em>in your case</em> is literally “about you.” The pronoun <em>your</em> is plural and refers to the author’s listeners. Some other ways to translate the phrase here are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>about you (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as for you</p></blockquote><h4>6:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>things that accompany salvation.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and these things show that you<sup>(plur)</sup> are saved.</p></li><li><p>which show that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has saved you<sup>(plur)</sup>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>things that accompany salvation:</strong> This phrase refers to results or evidence of salvation. It implies that people who are saved will live as Christ wants them to live and do the good things that he wants them to do. Some other ways to translate the phrase <em>things that accompany salvation</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your doings are good and that is a sign that you are saved already<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Yakan back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your souls are saved, and therefore you do what is good.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:9a–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">There are different ways to order the clauses in 6:9. For example, the NASB follows the order of clauses in the Greek text:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>9b</sup>But, beloved, we are convinced of better things concerning you, <sup>9c</sup>and things that accompany salvation, <sup>9a</sup>though we are speaking in this way. (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In other languages it is more natural to reorder the clauses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>9a</sup>But even if we speak like this, dear friends, <sup>9b</sup>we feel sure about you. We know that <sup>9c</sup>you have the better blessings that belong to your salvation. (GNT)</p></blockquote></div>",

In many languages it is more natural to use two or more sentences. See the General Comment on 6:10a–b at the end of 6:10b for more information.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> Here the word <em>For</em> introduces a reason for the author’s statement in 6:9. It tells why he is confident that his listeners have God’s salvation. God is not unjust, so he will not forget what they have done for him. Some versions leave the connection implied. Indicate the connection between 6:9 and 6:10 in a natural way in your language.</p><h4>6:10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For God is not unjust.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>God is not unfair,</p></li><li><p>God is always just/righteous,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God is not unjust:</strong> The phrase <em>not unjust</em> is an emphatic way to say “God is just.” The author used two negatives <em>not</em> and “<u>un</u>just” to emphasize the meaning. He also emphasized it by putting the word <em>not</em> first in the Greek sentence. In some languages, it may be more natural to emphasize the statement in a different way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God is always fair. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God really is completely righteous.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God always treats <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> fairly.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>not unjust:</strong> In many languages it is necessary to translate the phrase <em>not unjust</em> as “fair, righteous” and then to emphasize the meaning. See the examples in the preceding note.</p><h4>6:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He will not forget your work</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and he will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">always</span> remember all you<sup>(plur)</sup> do</p></li><li><p>so he will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">never</span> forget the good things that you<sup>(plur)</sup> have done.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He will not forget your work:</strong> The word <em>He</em> refers to God. The phrase <em>will not forget</em> tells a result of 6:10a, God is just (he is not unjust). Because he is just, he will not disregard the work that they did for him. In Greek the negative <em>will not forget</em> emphasizes that God will notice it. It implies that he will reward them for the work that they have done.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this statement are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He will not forget how hard you have worked for him (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He will remember how you helped his people (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that the phrase <em>not forget</em> is similar to the phrase “not unjust” in 6:10a, because it uses a negative phrase to emphasize a positive statement.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your work:</strong> The phrase <em>your work</em> refers here to everything that the Hebrews did for the Lord and the ways that they served him by serving God’s people (as he says in 6:10c). It does not refer to work for which they were paid. In some languages it is more natural to translate the phrase <em>your work</em> more specifically. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the good that you have done<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the work of God that you are doing<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Otomi back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>your:</strong> The pronoun <em>your</em> is plural and refers to the people who heard or read what the author said.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:10a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek text, 6:10a and 6:10b are part of one clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For God is not so unjust as to overlook your work… (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Many English versions translate 6:10a and 6:10b as two sentences. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God is not unfair.

God will not forget that they showed their love for him by serving their fellow Christians and continuing to serve them. He will remember that they love him and that they proved their love by helping his people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate 6:10c–d are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and how you have shown your love to him by caring for other believers, as you still do (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and your love for him that you have continued to show…in your helping your companions who believe<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><h4>6:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and the love you have shown for His name</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and how you<sup>(plur)</sup> show that you<sup>(plur)</sup> love him</p></li><li><p>You<sup>(plur)</sup> have shown that you<sup>(plur)</sup> love him</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the love you have shown for His name:</strong> In this context the word <em>love</em> refers to the love that the listeners showed for God by helping his people. They did practical things to help other Christians who needed it, and their actions showed that they loved God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to translate <em>love</em> as a verb instead of a noun. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and the ways you have shown that you love him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>how you continue to show that you love him</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See <u>love, sense A</u>, in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for His name:</strong> The phrase <em>for His name</em> means “for God.”</p><h4>6:10d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:10d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>as you have ministered to the saints and continue to do so.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>by serving your<sup>(plur)</sup> fellow-believers.

In some languages it is natural to begin a new sentence here and repeat part of 6:10a–b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is clear that you love God, for much is your helping your one-faith relatives, both in past times and at the present time.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>as you have ministered:</strong> Here the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>as you have ministered</em> means “to help by providing what someone needs.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Compare <em>διακονέω</em> BDAG, page 229, meaning 3 “to meet an immediate need, help.”</span></span> Some other ways to translate the phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as you have helped (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>by caring for (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the saints:</strong> The phrase <em>the saints</em> is literally “the holy ones.” It refers to people who are dedicated to God. In this context it refers specifically to people who follow Christ. The phrase is often used in this way in the epistles to refer to Christians. Some other ways to translate the phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his holy people (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his people (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>other believers (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">For more information, see <u>holy, sense 3(a)</u>, in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and continue to do so:</strong> In Greek this phrase is more literally “and serving.” It completes the meaning of the preceding phrase. It indicates that the listeners continued to help their fellow believers as they did in the past. Some other ways to translate the phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and you continue to help them (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And he will remember that you are still serving them.

In 6:7–8 the author sternly warned his readers that they must not give up their faith in Christ. Here in 6:9–12 he assured them that he believed better things about them.

Be sure to use a natural way in your language to express the relationship of the phrases. See the General Comment on 6:11 at the end of 6:11 for examples.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>We want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end, in order to make your hope sure:</strong> There are two views about what the phrase <em>to the very end</em> is connected to in this verse:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is connected to “show the same diligence.” It means that they should be diligent to the very end. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We want each of you to <u>show this same diligence to the very end</u>, so that what you hope for may be fully realized. (NIV) <em>(BSB, NIV, NLT, GNT, NCV, REB, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is connected to “realize the full assurance of hope.” It means that they should be eager to realize the hope until the end. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence so as to <u>realize the full assurance of hope until the end</u>. (NASB) <em>(NRSV, NASB, ESV, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions are ambiguous. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), along with most English versions and commentators.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>We want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end:</strong> In 6:10 the author indicated that the listeners had showed love for God by serving other believers. Here in 6:11 the author told them to continue to show that same eagerness to serve until the end of their lives. Some other ways to translate this meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and we earnestly request that every one of you will continue to behave like that for as long as you live</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Our great desire is that you will keep on faithfully doing this until you die</p></blockquote><h4>6:11a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:11a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>We want each of you to show this same diligence</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>We<sup>(excl)</sup> earnestly desire/plead that each of you will be faithful/eager to do this</p></li><li><p>My great desire is for each of you to continue to show <span data-bnType=\"implied\">your love for him</span> faithfully like that</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>We:</strong> The word <em>We</em> refers here to the author of Hebrews. It does not include the listeners. At the time when Hebrews was written, it was common for an author to use a plural form to refer to himself. In some languages it is more natural to use a singular form like “I.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>want:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>want</em> means “to earnestly desire.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This Greek verb is used only here in Hebrews, but it occurs sixteen times in the NT.</span></span> It indicates here that the author strongly desired his listeners to be diligent. Other ways to translate this meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>greatly desire</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>earnestly beg/plead</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may more natural to use a noun to translate the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>great desire (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>earnest wish (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>longing</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to show this same diligence:</strong> The phrase <em>this same diligence</em> refers to the same type of eager effort and perseverance that the listeners showed in the past when they served God’s people. It indicates that they were devoted to what they were doing. In some languages it is more natural to use a verb to translate this phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to persevere</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to faithfully continue to do this</p></blockquote><h4>6:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to the very end, in order to make your hope sure.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to the end <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of your</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">lives</span> to ensure that you will receive what you<sup>(plur)</sup> hope for.</p></li><li><p>until you<sup>(plur)</sup> die. Then you<sup>(plur)</sup> will fully experience what you expect <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from him</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to the very end:</strong> In Greek this phrase is more literally, “until the end.” There are two ways to interpret this phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “to the end of their lives.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as long as life lasts (NLT) <em>(NLT, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “until the end of time when the Lord returns.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>until the last day<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions are ambiguous. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). In the context of Hebrews, the believers suffered persecution and might be killed for following Jesus. It is important for believers to be faithful to him for as long as we live.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all your lives (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as long as you live<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Yakan back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in order to make your hope sure:</strong> This clause indicates the purpose of continuing to be diligent. The listeners should continue to be diligent so that they will be sure to receive what they hope for. Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that you will receive what you have fully/confidently expected</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so you will surely get what you hope for (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>hope:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>hope</em> refers to expecting something with confidence that it will happen. That expectation is based on a reason.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For more information, see <em>ἐλπίς</em> meaning 1b ß. page 320.</span></span> In this context <em>hope</em> refers to being confident that God will do the good things that he promised to do for his people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to express <em>hope</em> with a clause. For instance:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>what you hope for</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>what you confidently expect</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This word occurred also in 3:6. See how you translated it there. It also occurs in 6:18, 7:19 and 10:23.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:11</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In this verse the author indicated that the listeners should continue to do what he praised them for doing in 6:10. Be sure that the reference back to those actions is clear. Some other ways to make it clear are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We really request that every one of you exert effort to have <u>behavior like that</u> until the end so that you will indeed get what you are hoping for from God.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW with omission of the conjunction and vocative.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>That is what we wish, that each one of you <u>simply/just perseveres doing like that</u> as long as you live so that your expectation from God will be fulfilled.</p></blockquote></div>",

In 6:7–8 the author sternly warned his readers that they must not give up their faith in Christ. Here in 6:9–12 he assured them that he believed better things about them. He encouraged them not to become lazy but to keep trusting Christ so that they will obtain all that Christ promised.</p></div><h4>6:12a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:12a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Then you will not be sluggish,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Be<sup>(plur)</sup> careful not to become dull/lazy,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We</span><sup>(excl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">urge</span> you<sup>(plur)</sup> not to be lazy.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Then you will not be sluggish:</strong> This clause tells the result of the listeners being diligent to care for other believers. When they do that, they will not become lazy so that they stop listening to God and serving him. Instead, they will be eager to learn more about him and to serve his people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this result are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Then you will not become spiritually dull (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Because if you do that, you will not become lazy<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you:</strong> The pronoun <em>you</em> is plural and refers to all the people who listened to what the author said in Hebrews.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sluggish:</strong> The Greek word that the author used here was also used in the first verse of this section (5:11). There the BSB translated it as “dull.” In Hebrews this word refers to being lazy, dull, and sluggish, especially about faith in Christ. In this context it implies that the people may become lazy. Then they may not try hard to understand what God said and obey him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this word in the same way (or a similar way) as you did in 5:11.</p><h4>6:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but will imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but imitate people who trust in God and are patient.

In 6:12a the author told the Hebrews not to be sluggish. Here in 6:12b he tells them what they should do instead. They should imitate faithful believers by following their example.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to introduce this contrast are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Instead, you will follow the example of those… (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but to be like those… (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages the contrast connection is implied by the context and a conjunction is not needed. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Be like those who… (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>What you should copy is the people who…<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Tagbanwa back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who…inherit what has been promised:</strong> This phrase describes the people whom the Hebrews should imitate. They should imitate the people who <em>inherit what has been promised</em>. The word <em>inherit</em> is used in a figurative way here to mean “receive.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the phrase <em>who…inherit what has been promised</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who receive what was promised</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people who obtain what God promised</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>inherit what has been promised:</strong> The word <em>inherit</em> refers here to people receiving what God promised them. It implies that God made the promises for all the people who will faithfully believe what he said. The promises were not only for the first people to whom God spoke them. The phrase does <u>not</u> imply that someone died and other people inherited the promises from him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate <em>inherit what has been promised</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>receive what God has promised (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>are given what God promised</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>obtain what he has promised to them<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase is similar to the phrase “inherit salvation” in 1:14. You can probably translate the word <em>inherit</em> in a similar way here.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>what has been promised:</strong> The phrase <em>what has been promised</em> refers to the good things that God promised to do for his people and to what he promised to give them. God made the promises because of his grace and goodness, not because his people did something to deserve them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word “promise” was also used in 4:1, and you should translate a plural form of the word here. Remember that a promise tells a person’s intention to do something. The person is obligated to do what he has said or he will be disgraced. A promise is different from an oath, so you should use different ways to translate these two words.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>through faith and patience:</strong> The phrase <em>through faith and patience</em> tells how the people obtained what God promised. They patiently believed what God said, and as a result, God did fulfill his promises to them. Notice that the words <em>faith</em> and <em>patience</em> are used here to describe one action. The people patiently had faith in God. Because of their patient faith, they received what he promised.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the phrase “those who through faith and patience inherit the promises” are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people who believe God and who patiently wait until they obtain what he has promised to them<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who receive what God has promised because of their persevering faith and patience<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the ones who are patient and continue to trust in God and so they receive what he promised them</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>faith and patience:</strong> The words <em>faith and patience</em> are closely related here. Together the two words describe the people’s attitude toward God. They patiently had faith in him. They continued to faithfully believe in him until he did what he promised.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to translate the two words as one action and the manner in which the action is done. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people who <u>patiently believe</u> in God, for because of this, they will receive…<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Western Bukidnon Manobo back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>faith:</strong> The word <em>faith</em> refers to trusting God and believing that what he says is true. It implies here that the people have confidence in God and in what God says. In some languages it is more natural to translate the word <em>faith</em> as a verb here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>because they trust/believe God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See the other examples in the preceding notes on 6:12b. For more information, see <u>believe, sense C</u>, in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>patience:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>patience</em> refers to being calm and steadfast while waiting for something to happen. In this context where <em>patience</em> is used along with “faith” and “promises” the word <em>patience</em> refers to steadfastly continuing to wait and expect God to fulfill his promises.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate <em>patience</em> here are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>patiently wait<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who really persevere<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Yakan back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote>",

He urged them to keep on believing. He warned them not to give up what they believed. In this final section, he reminded them of God’s promise to Abraham, and he encouraged them that God always keeps his promises. We can come into God’s presence because Jesus, our high priest, is already there (6:20). He is a high priest like Melchizedek.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The last verse of this section is similar to 5:10, and connects this section to chapter 7. The author finished his long appeal to his readers in 6:20, and in 7:1 he continued his teaching about Jesus, our high priest.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other possible section headings are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God always does what he promises to do</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We can believe God because he always does what he said he would</p></blockquote></div><h4>6:13a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:13a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>When God made His promise to Abraham,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ When God gave Abraham his promise,</p></li><li><p>¶ God promised <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to bless</span> Abraham, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and swore to fulfill the promise</span>.</p></li><li><p>¶ God made a promise to our<sup>(incl)</sup> ancestor Abraham,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek the author connects this verse to the preceding section with a conjunction that is often translated as “for.” It indicates that the author will give support for what he said in the preceding verses. Here is another way to translate this conjunction:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For example (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The author also linked 6:13 with 6:12 by referring to the meaning “promise” in both. Use a natural way in your language to introduce such supporting comments. See the next note for more examples. In some languages a connector is not necessary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>When God made His promise to Abraham:</strong> In this clause the author wrote about God’s promises at the end of 6:12. Here he continued to say more about them. He used Abraham as an example. God promised to bless Abraham and give him many descendants, as in Genesis 12:1–4 and 15:1–5. Then after Abraham was willing to offer Isaac as a sacrifice to him (Genesis 22:1–14), God added an oath to his promise.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>After the drama of Isaac’s birth in Genesis 21, and the testing experience of Genesis 22, God emphasizes his promise to Abraham with an oath. The words “I swear by myself” only occur four times in the Old Testament—in Genesis 22:16; Isaiah 45:23; Jeremiah 22:1, 49:13.</span></span> See also Genesis 22:15–18.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Let’s consider Abraham, because there is also that which God promised him<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Remember God’s promise to Abraham.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Tagbanwa back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Abraham:</strong> In some languages it is more natural to identify Abraham more explicitly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>our<sup>(incl)</sup> ancestor Abraham</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Abraham, who is the ancestor for our<sup>(incl)</sup> tribe</p></blockquote><h4>6:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>since He had no one greater to swear by,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God knew</span> that there was no one who was greater than himself to guarantee/support the promise,</p></li><li><p>Since no one is higher/greater than God so that God could swear by him,</p></li><li><p>and there was no one greater than himself to support/confirm what he promised.</p></li></ul></div><h4>6:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He swore by Himself,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so he swore by himself.</p></li><li><p>he swore by his own name.</p></li><li><p>So God used his own name to take an oath to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">do what he promised</span>.</p></li></ul></div><h4>6:13b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>since He had no one greater to swear by, He swore by Himself:</strong> In 6:13b–c the author tells why God swore by himself. God swore by himself because there is no one greater than he is. He himself was the only one who was able to fulfill the promise. There was also no one else to whom people could appeal to cause God to fulfill what he promised. Some other ways to translate this reason are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Since there was no one greater than himself, he used his own name when he made his vow. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>There is nothing greater than God, so he swore naming himself.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Western Bukidnon Manobo back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>one greater to swear by:</strong> The phrase <em>to swear by</em> refers to anyone to whom God could appeal to enforce or strengthen his oath. The text implies that a person who could enforce the promise must be more powerful than the person who makes the promise. That is the only way that such a person could punish him if he did not fulfill what he swore to do. Since no one is as powerful as God, no one could punish him if he did not do what he promised to do. Another way to translate this meaning is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to guarantee his oath</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who could make him fulfill his oath</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>swear:</strong> To <em>swear</em> is to take an oath or to make a promise to do something. When someone adds an oath to what he is saying, it means “What I am saying is true.” It does not imply that the person is using bad or inappropriate words. For more information, see also the note on 6:16a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>He swore by Himself:</strong> The clause <em>He swore by Himself</em> means “he promised that he would enforce the promise on himself.” Men have to swear by someone or something greater than themselves to guarantee that the promise is kept. But God swore by himself that he would keep his promise, because there is no one greater than himself to guarantee it. Other ways to translate this meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he used himself when he swore (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God took an oath in his own name (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">God’s word can be trusted without the help of an oath, but God made it twice as dependable by adding an oath. See also 7:20 and the following verses. It is similar to the words “As I live…” which God often said in the Old Testament when he was speaking.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:13b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to reorder 6:13b–c.

See the General Comment on 6:18a–d at the end of 6:18d for examples.</p><h4>6:18a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:18a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Thus by two unchangeable things</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>God gave both his promise and his oath, and neither of them can be changed.</p></li><li><p>He gave his people these two assurances that cannot change</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Thus:</strong> The Greek conjunction translated <em>Thus</em> introduces the <u>purpose</u> for God confirming his promise with an oath (in 6:17). Indicate this purpose in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by two unchangeable things:</strong> The phrase <em>by two unchangeable things</em> indicates the means by which God assured people that he will do what he said. He reassured them in two ways: (1) by making a promise to them and (2) by confirming his promise with an oath.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate <em>by two unchangeable things</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>by saying two things which cannot be changed</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He did that so there would be two unchanging means by which people will know…</p></blockquote><h4>6:18b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:18b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in which it is impossible for God to lie,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It is also impossible that God would fail to fulfill either his promise or his oath.</p></li><li><p>and about which he cannot lie.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in which it is impossible for God to lie:</strong> This part of the verse refers to the two unchangeable things mentioned in 6:18b. It indicates that God cannot fail to keep either his promise or his oath. He is certain to keep both of them. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and God cannot break either of them</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to lie:</strong> The verb <em>to lie</em> refers here to not doing what was said or promised. Here it indicates that God will never fail to do what he says. He will always do what he says he will do, and no one can ever truly say that God has not kept his promise. Another way to say this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to not fulfill his promise</p></blockquote><h4>6:18c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:18c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>we who have fled</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">So he wants</span> us who have fled <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to him</span></p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He did that so that</span> when we<sup>(incl)</sup> run <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to him</span> for safety</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we who have fled:</strong> Here the author described his readers and himself as people who have fled to find refuge. He did not say what they had found refuge <u>from</u>. He said what they found refuge <u>in</u>. They took refuge in their certainty that God will do what he promised them. In many languages it is helpful to make God explicit here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we have run to God for safety (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we have fled to him for refuge (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we:</strong> The pronoun <em>we</em> is inclusive and refers to both the author and the readers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>have fled:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>have fled</em> also means “flee to a place.” It implies fleeing somewhere where they will be safe. In this context the refuge is God, and people trust him to save them.</p><h4>6:18d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:18d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to take hold of the hope set before us may be strongly encouraged.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to hold tightly to the hope that he gave us.</p></li><li><p>we will have confidence to receive what God told us to expect.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to take hold of the hope set before us may be strongly encouraged:</strong> The phrase <em>may be strongly encouraged</em> is more literally “will have strong encouragement.” It indicates God’s purpose for giving us his promise and oath. He wanted to give us great courage to persevere in trusting him to fulfill his promise. Some other ways to translate 6:18d are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>can have great confidence as we hold to the hope (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we will persevere in hoping/expecting <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what he has promised</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the hope:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>hope</em> refers here to what we expect with confidence (from God). It includes all the good things that God has promised and prepared for us, including eternal life. It occurs also in 3:6, 6:11, 7:19, 10:23.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>set before us:</strong> The phrase <em>set before us</em> is one word in Greek. It means “lying before us,” and it refers to what God will do for us in the future. The verb is passive. In some languages it is more natural to translate this with an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>which God has given to us</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that God promised us</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>us:</strong> The pronoun <em>us</em> is inclusive and refers to both the author and the readers.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:18a–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In 6:18 the author indicated that God gave us both his promise and his oath to give us great confidence that he will save us as he promised. Neither the promise nor the oath can be broken, because it is impossible for God to lie.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be helpful to change the order of phrases in this verse. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So we have both his promise and his oath which cannot be broken because it is impossible for God to lie. God confirmed his promise with an oath so that we might be very encouraged. We are people who have found refuge and firmly expect with hope what God has for us.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God did this so that we would be encouraged. God cannot lie when he takes an oath or makes a promise. These two things can never be changed. Those of us who have taken refuge in him hold on to the confidence we have been given. (GW)</p></blockquote></div>",

He urged them to keep on believing. He warned them not to give up what they believed. In this final section, he reminded them of God’s promise to Abraham, and he encouraged them that God always keeps his promises. We can come into God’s presence because Jesus, our high priest, is already there (6:20). He is a high priest like Melchizedek.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The last verse of this section is similar to 5:10, and connects this section to chapter 7. The author finished his long appeal to his readers in 6:20, and in 7:1 he continued his teaching about Jesus, our high priest.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other possible section headings are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God always does what he promises to do</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We can believe God because he always does what he said he would</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1059006016\" data-endVerseId=\"1059006020\"><h3>Paragraph 6:16–20</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In 6:16–20 the author continued to explain about God’s oath. In Greek, these verses are one long sentence, but English versions have divided it into shorter ones.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The most solemn oath which the people of Israel used was “As (surely as) the Lord lives.”</span></span></p></div><h4>6:19–20</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Some versions begin a new paragraph here. In 6:18 the author said that we can be absolutely certain or sure of the things we hope for. In 6:19–20 he used three different figures of speech to describe what this hope is like, and what its results are. The three figures are an <u>anchor</u>, the <u>curtain</u> covering the inner part of the temple, and a <u>forerunner</u>. These figures of speech follow immediately one after the other.</p><h4>6:19a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:19a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>This hope makes us<sup>(incl)</sup> secure and strong.</p></li><li><p>This expectation is like a strong anchor/support that will not let us<sup>(incl)</sup> slip away.</p></li><li><p>When we<sup>(incl)</sup> know that God will bless us like this, we<sup>(incl)</sup> are safe and strong.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure:</strong> Here the author compared our hope to an <em>anchor</em>. Literally, an <em>anchor</em> is a heavy object to which a boat is tied, so that it will not move. As a metaphor, it indicates that our souls are secure. We are supported by our confidence that Jesus has become the source of eternal salvation for us (5:9).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In many cultures anchors are unknown. Some other ways to translate the metaphor are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate <em>anchor</em> as a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This hope is like a firm and steady anchor for our souls. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The way we hope in God is like the heavy weight that keeps a boat from drifting away.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a similar figure of speech or one that is more general. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>That hoping of ours is like a foundation stone that makes our hearts stay so that our faith does not shake/rock.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This hope of ours, that is what makes firm/stable our faith, because it is certain to be fulfilled.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>We:</strong> The pronoun <em>We</em> is inclusive and refers to both the author and the readers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>this hope:</strong> The <em>hope</em> refers to looking forward to something and expecting it with confidence.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Compare <em>ἐλπίς</em> meaning 1c, BDAG, pages 319–320.</span></span> It does not imply that a person is not sure that he will receive it, as the English word sometimes does. Some other ways to translate it are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>confidence (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>our hoping</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>our expecting <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to receive the promise</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>this hope</em> refers specifically to expecting that we will receive “the promise” that the author mentioned in 6:17. Receiving what God promised is the hope that the author referred to in 6:18d.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>anchor for the soul:</strong> The phrase <em>anchor for the soul</em> implies here that our confidence in God makes us firm and steadfast in trusting him. Some other ways to translate this meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>our hope helps us trust <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> steadily</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it is like a firm foundation that keeps us from moving away <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from God</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>soul:</strong> The word <em>soul</em> refers to the inner part of a person which thinks and feels and makes decisions. It was also used in 4:12c–d.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">For more information, see <u>soul, sense A1c</u>, in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>firm and secure:</strong> Here the author used two similar words to emphasize his meaning (as he often does in Hebrews). The word <em>firm</em> means “stable, steadfast, and strong.” The word <em>secure</em> means “safe,” or “reliable.” Some other ways to translate this emphasis are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>strongly/completely trust</p></blockquote><h4>6:19b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:19b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It has gone behind the dividing curtain into the holiest place</p></li><li><p>It is as if we ourselves can see into the inner holy place behind the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">temple</span> curtain,</p></li><li><p>We<sup>(incl)</sup> may enter into the presence of God himself</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain:</strong> This statement is a figure of speech. The pronoun <em>It</em> refers here to confidence in God’s promise and oath. It indicates that because of this confidence, we can approach God himself.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In many languages it is not natural to speak of <em>It</em> as entering a place. If that is true in your language, you may need to make the meaning more explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Because of our hope, it is as if we have already entered the exact place of God like the entering of the highest priest into the Holiest Room in the Temple which a curtain hid from view.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kankanaey back translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain:</strong> The phrase <em>enters the inner sanctuary</em> means “goes inside the most holy place behind the curtain <span data-bnType=\"implied\">where God is</span>.” In the OT, the <em>inner sanctuary behind the curtain</em> was the holiest part of the tabernacle. It was the place where God met with the high priest. The high priest represented the people of Israel there. This shrine was separated from the rest of the tabernacle by a curtain. The shrine was such a holy place that only the high priest could enter it, and he entered it only once a year. In 9:1–7 the author describes this place again.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The <em>inner sanctuary</em> was a place, not an altar. It was the most holy place of all in both the tabernacle and the temple, and was the place where God himself dwells. The phrase <em>behind the curtain</em> implies “into the presence of God.”</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the curtain:</strong> In the Gospels, the word <em>curtain</em> always refers to the curtain that divided the most holy place in the temple from the other parts of the temple. This curtain was torn apart when Jesus died, as a sign that the way into God’s presence was now open (Matthew 27:51; Mark 15:38 and Luke 23:45). The author will refer to this curtain again later in 9:3 and 10:20.</p>",

Now, in the last sentence of this chapter, the author repeated what he said in 5:10 about Jesus being a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek. There are some changes here in 6:20. The differences in these two verses are underlined below:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>5:10 having <u>been designated</u> <u>by God</u> a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>6:20b–c having <u>become</u> a high priest <u>forever</u> according to the order to Melchizedek.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Try to preserve the similarities and differences in these two verses in your translation.</p><h4>6:20b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:20b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He has become a high priest forever</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He has become the high priest forever</p></li><li><p>Now he is our eternal high priest</p></li><li><p>and he has the position of high priest forever</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He has become a high priest forever:</strong> This phrase indicates that when Jesus came into the presence of God on our behalf, he had already become a high priest forever. At that time he had offered himself and his own blood as a sacrifice to atone for our sins. In some languages it is helpful to begin a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He had become a high priest forever.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In 5:10, the author described Jesus as “designated” by God to be a high priest. Here the verb is simply “became.” Try to maintain the similarities and differences in 5:10 and 6:20 in your translation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>high priest:</strong> The author calls Jesus <em>high priest</em> often in Hebrews. Translate the term as you did in 2:17b or 5:1a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>forever:</strong> The word <em>forever</em> indicates that Jesus will always be the high priest.
