It identifies the prophet’s name, the subject of his message, and the time period during which he lived and prophesied. Most English versions have a separate book title, such as “Micah,” followed directly by 1:1. There are two main ways to show the relationship of 1:1 to the rest of the book:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Place a section heading before 1:1. Here are some other examples of section headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The beginning of the book</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The LORD revealed his words to Micah</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Do not place any heading before 1:1. Instead, place the first heading before 1:2. See the examples in the note on Section 1:2–7. The Notes and many English versions follow this approach. You may follow either approach in your translation.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">Micah 1:1 is similar to the first verses of books by other prophets. For example see Hosea 1:1, Joel 1:1, Zephaniah 1:1, Haggai 1:1, Zechariah 1:1, and Isaiah 1:1. If you have already translated some of these verses, consider using a similar style here.</p></div><h4>1:1</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>This is the word of the LORD that came to Micah the Moreshite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah—what he saw regarding Samaria and Jerusalem:</strong> This book contains the words spoken by Micah. Because of that, some translators have translated this verse using the pronouns “I” or “me.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am Micah from Moresheth. And this is the message about Samaria and Jerusalem that the Lord gave to me when Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah were the kings of Judah. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This translation is not recommended, because some scholars believe that an editor added this verse after Micah’s messages had been written down. For more details, see “The author, the date, and Micah’s audience” in the introduction.</p><h4>1:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>This is the word of the LORD that came to Micah the Moreshite</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ This is a word/message from Yahweh. It came/happened to Micah from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the town/village of</span> Moresheth</p></li><li><p>¶ These are the words/messages that Yahweh spoke to Micah, who was from Moresheth,</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">In this book is written</span> the message that Yahweh revealed to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the prophet</span> Micah from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the town of</span> Moresheth.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>This is the word of the LORD that came to Micah the Moreshite:</strong> This verse part indicates that Micah’s messages were from the LORD. In Hebrew, the phrase <em>the word of the LORD</em> is emphasized by its position at the beginning of the verse.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>UBS (page 124).</span></span> Try to keep this emphasis in your translation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the Hebrew, this clause is more literally, “the word of the LORD which was to Micah the Moreshite.” In some languages, it may be more natural to translate this verse as a complete sentence, as in the BSB. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Lord spoke his word to Micah, who was from Moresheth… (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This is the prophetic message that the Lord gave to Micah of Moresheth. (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>word:</strong> In some languages, it may be more natural to use plural forms.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Although the book is presented as a single message from the LORD, it is clear from 1:1 that Micah prophesied during the reigns of three different kings of Judah. Scholars agree that he gave a series of different prophecies and that he spoke to more than one group of people.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>These are the <u>words</u> of the Eternal One (Voice)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Lord gave these <u>messages</u> to Micah of Moresheth… (NLT96)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>LORD:</strong> The word <em>LORD</em> represents the Hebrew word “Yahweh,” the personal name of God. In Hebrew, this is a proper name, not a title or general noun. See the discussion of Yahweh, the LORD, in the Introduction.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>came:</strong> In Hebrew, this word is a form of the verb “to be.” It is more literally “became” or “happened.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT (#491), NIDOTTE (#2118).</span></span> It indicates here that Micah experienced messages from the LORD as powerful events that occurred in his life.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>WBC (page 14) says that “the Hebrew language is action-oriented. Therefore the force here is that the word ‘happened,’ ‘came in power’ to Micah.” According to NAC (page 43), when the “word-event formula” occurs “in reference…to the coming of the Lord’s word,” it emphasizes the nature of that word as a historical event.</span></span> In some languages, it may be possible to translate this idea with a word or expression other than <em>came</em>, “gave,” or “spoke.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>happened to Micah</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Micah experienced</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Micah:</strong> This is the name of the prophet who spoke these messages to the people. <em>Micah</em> is a shortened form of Micaiah, which means “Who is like the LORD?” in Hebrew.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The prophet Micah is also mentioned in Jeremiah 26:18–19, but there his name is spelled “Micaiah.” Most English versions spell his name as “Micah” in both places. There were several people named Micah in the Old Testament. There was another prophet who was named Micaiah (I Kings 22:8–28; 2 Chronicles 18:4–27). Most English versions spell that other prophet’s name “Micaiah.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Moreshite:</strong> Micah’s home town is named Moresheth. Most scholars think that it was a small town about 35 kilometers southwest of Jerusalem. Translate this phrase in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Micah, who was from the town of Moresheth (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Micah the Moresheth person.</p></blockquote><h4>1:1a–c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1a–c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(combined/reordered)</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>These are the messages about <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the cities of</span> Samaria and Jerusalem that Yahweh himself showed/revealed to Micah, a prophet from Moresheth.

It is difficult to know the exact dates when these three kings ruled, because sometimes before a king died his son began to rule as king together with his father. According to UBS (page 124), Jotham ruled as king from about 740 B.C. until 736 B.C. Ahaz ruled from 734 B.C. until 716 B.C. And Hezekiah ruled from 716 B.C. until 687 B.C. In 1:6–7, Micah predicted that the city of Samaria would be destroyed. Samaria was destroyed in 722 B.C. or 721 B.C., during the time that Ahaz was king in Judah. So we know that the LORD gave this message to Micah before that time. But we do not know the exact time that Micah received and delivered most of the messages in this book. He was probably a prophet for at least 20 years (the end of Jotham’s reign until the beginning of Hezekiah’s reign). But he may have been a prophet for longer than 50 years (from the beginning of Jotham’s reign until the end of Hezekiah’s reign). Waltke 2007 (page 34), whose dates differ slightly from UBS, suggests 53 years as the maximum limit.</span></span> They ruled one after the other. They did not rule at the same time. If this is not clear in your translation, you may want to make this information explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He told/spoke these messages</span> during the time that King Jotham ruled in Judah, until the time that King Ahaz ruled, and then during the time that King Hezekiah ruled.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in the days of:</strong> In this context, the Hebrew phrase <em>in the days of</em> refers to the period of time during which these particular kings ruled. In some languages, it may be necessary to make this information clearer. Here are some possible ways to do this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a <u>noun</u> other than <em>days</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…during the <u>reigns/governing</u> of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…during the <u>time</u> of…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…during the <u>years</u> of….</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a <u>verb</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…when kings Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah <u>ruled/reigned</u> in Judah.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use an expression that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah:</strong> If it is more natural in your language, you can use the title “king” with each name, “King Jotham, King Ahaz, and King Hezekiah in Judah.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The story of these kings is written in the book of 2 Kings. For the story of King Jotham, see 2 Kings 15:32–38. For King Ahaz see 2 Kings 16:1–19. For King Hezekiah, see 2 Kings 18:1–20:20. The stories of these kings are also told in 2 Chronicles and in other parts of the Old Testament.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Judah:</strong> The name <em>Judah</em> here refers to the southern kingdom of Judah.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In some parts of the Bible, the name “Judah” refers to one of Jacob’s twelve sons. In other parts of the Bible, the name “Judah” refers to the Jewish tribe that was descended from Judah. In the books of 1 and 2 Kings, 1 and 2 Chronicles, and in some books written by prophets such as Micah, the name “Judah” refers to the southern kingdom.</span></span> In some languages, it may be helpful to identify Judah more explicitly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>land of Judah</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>country of Judah</p></blockquote><h4>1:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>what he saw regarding Samaria and Jerusalem:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Micah saw this word/message about Samaria and Jerusalem <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in a vision</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The words/messages mentioned above</span> that he saw <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in visions</span> described <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the cities of</span> Samaria and Jerusalem.</p></li><li><p>Yahweh caused Micah to see <span data-bnType=\"implied\">visions</span> about <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the cities of</span> Samaria and Jerusalem.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>what he saw:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the referent of this relative clause:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The words <em>what he saw</em> refer to “The word of the LORD that came to Micah.” (1:1a).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>WBC (page 13). According to A&amp;F (page 118), the strong consensus among translations and commentaries is that “the word of the LORD” is the antecedent of “which he saw.” A&amp;F, however, prefer the view that Micah is the antecedent, which would result in “the word of the LORD” came to Micah “who had a vision (or visions).”</span></span> This (referring back) is what Micah saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he received <u>it</u> in visions about Samaria and Jerusalem (REB) <em>(BSB, CEV, ESV, KJV, NAB, NASB, NET, NIV, NRSV, REB, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The words <em>what he saw</em> refer forward to Micah’s vision about Samaria and Jerusalem. There is no explicit connection with “The word of the LORD…” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The visions he saw concerned both Samaria and Jerusalem. (NLT) <em>(GW, NCV, NJB, NJPS)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions and commentaries.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Commentaries that support interpretation (1) include WBC, Waltke 2007, TOTC, NAC, and Hillers. Commentaries that support interpretation (2) include A&amp;F and perhaps NICOT, whose translation (page 264) has “received by revelation concerning…”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is important to understand the sense in which Micah <em>saw</em> the word that came to him from the LORD. There are different ways to interpret the meaning of the word in this context:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The word <em>saw</em> indicates that Micah <em>saw</em> the messages in the form of <u>visions</u>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Hebrew word for <em>saw</em> (<em>ḥazah</em>) is related to the Hebrew words for “vision” (<em>ḥazon</em>) and “seer” (<em>ḥoze</em>). All three come from the same root (<em>ḥzh</em>). TOTC (page 165) prefers the auditory (hearing) interpretation, but states that the experience “could be accompanied by visions as well.” EBC (page 501) do not use the term “vision” here, but describe a type of prophecy “in which the prophet describes future events as though they are unfolding before his eyes.”</span></span></p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“…the vision he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.” (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>His visions about Samaria and Jerusalem. (NJB) <em>(GW, NAB, NCV, NIV, NJB, NLT, REB)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In addition to these versions, all of which specify “vision(s),” the BSB, ESV, KJV, NASB, and NRSV all have “saw.” In the context of “seeing” the “word of the LORD,” the verb “saw” probably implies a vision or similar experience. The LXX also has “he saw.”</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The word <em>saw</em> indicates in a general way that Micah <u>received</u> the messages. In other words, the LORD <u>revealed</u> them to Micah in some way that is not stated.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to NICOT (page 265), the verb “see” is used as a technical term for prophecy. It refers “not only to visions but to the wider perception of divine revelation.” NAC (page 44) acknowledges that “the verb ‘saw’ by itself can occasionally mean ‘saw in a vision’” but prefers “the more general sense of receiving a divine revelation or a prophecy from the inspiring Spirit of the Lord.”</span></span></p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“The Lord revealed to Micah all these things about Samaria and Jerusalem.” (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>These words/messages were made known to Micah about Samaria and Jerusalem. <em>(GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The word <em>saw</em> indicates that Micah “prophesied.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This third interpretation is supported by the Targum, which translates Micah 1:1c as “…who prophesied concerning….” A&amp;F (page 118) think that the translation “who prophesied” (NJPS) is correct.</span></span></p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“…who prophesied concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.” (NJPS) <em>(NET, NJPS)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The word <em>saw</em> indicates that Micah “heard” the messages. No versions follow this interpretation, but it supported by several commentaries.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>CBC quotes NICOT (page 265), who comments that “see” is “a technical term of prophecy which developed to refer not only to visions but to the wider perception of divine revelation. In Micah’s case it was evidently of an auditory nature.” Waltke 1993 (pages 614–615). also interprets Micah’s experience as “auricular” (having to do with hearing). His reason is that “the Hebrew associates diverse sorts of vivid sensations with the eyes.”</span></span></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The Display will follow interpretation (1) along with most versions. You may follow either interpretation (1) or (2). There is little difference in meaning between them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>regarding Samaria and Jerusalem:</strong></p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Micah talked <u>about those two cities</u>. He said that <em>Samaria</em> would be destroyed (1:6–7). He said that <em>Jerusalem</em> would be destroyed (3:12).</p></li><li><p>Micah also talked <u>to the people who lived in those two cities</u>. He accused them of sinning. He warned them that the LORD would punish them. He also told them that the LORD would bless them again in the future.</p></li><li><p><em>Samaria</em> was the capital of Israel (the northern kingdom). <em>Jerusalem</em> was the capital of Judah (the southern kingdom).

Others make statements that could support either interpretation. NAC (page 48) clearly favors interpretation (1). It says: “The addressees are ‘all peoples,’ a reference to all nations, as shown by the parallel (more literally ‘those who fill the earth’).” KD (page 289–290) agrees with NAC, WBC, and Waltke 2007 that the phrase “those who fill with earth” supports the view that “all peoples” refer to all nations, not to all tribes of Israel, but he thinks that “the whole earth, and all creatures upon it, are to hear, because the judgment which the prophet has to announce to Israel affects the whole earth.” With this view, the command to pay careful attention must be understood as highly personified, since mountains and non-human creatures cannot literally “listen” to what the Sovereign LORD says in the more literal sense that peoples/nations can listen.</span></span> There are at least two reasons:</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:2a–b</strong></h5><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The parallel line (1:2a) clearly refers to the people groups or nations of the world rather than to the earth or other created things. With interpretation (1), the parallel parts in 1:2b have the same reference.</p></li><li><p>The context that follows these parallel commands deals primarily with Israel and Judah and with other nations. It assumes that Micah’s audience will be able to pay attention and respond to this first message.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The second message begins at 3:1. It is addressed to the leaders of Jacob/Israel. The third message begins at 6:1. Like the other messages, it presents a legal case, this time the LORD’s case against Israel. It corresponds somewhat to interpretation (2) in 1:2b, because it urges the mountains and foundations of the earth to listen to the LORD as he presents his case.</span></span></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to combine and/or reorder these two parallel lines. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>All you people on earth, you from all the nations, listen carefully.</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>May the Lord GOD bear witness against you, the Lord from His holy temple.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The Lord Yahweh, who is in his holy temple, will testify/witness against you<sup>(plur)</sup>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Hear what</span> Lord/King Yahweh <span data-bnType=\"implied\">says as he</span> accuses/judges you from the holy place where he lives.</p></li><li><p>Yahweh the all-powerful King will tell about the evil things you have done. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">He will speak</span> from the special place that is set apart as his own home.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>May the Lord GOD bear witness against you:</strong> In this verse part, Micah implied that the people should listen to the testimony that the Lord was about to give. Some of these words are found in 1:6–7.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are textual<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The MT, two different Hebrew manuscripts, and the LXX all differ in the way they understand the initial word (<em>wihi</em>) in this verse part. TN has focused on the main textual and interpretation issues rather than complicating the discussion. See Waltke 2007 (page 45) for more details. In addition to these textual issues, the LXX has “among you for a testimony” rather than “a witness against you.” The REB has “so that the Lord GOD…may bear witness among you.” The rendering “among you” is not supported by other English versions used in TN or by most scholars.</span></span> and interpretation issues that affect the function of this verse part and its relationship to Micah’s commands in 1:2a–b to listen carefully. The Notes will discuss these issues together. Here are the main interpretations:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>This verse part is a statement that the Lord GOD will testify against the people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lord GOD will be a witness against you (NCV) <em>(CEV, GW, NCV, NET, NIV, NJB, NLT, REB, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>This verse part is an indirect, third-person request. It expresses Micah’s prayer or desire that the Lord GOD will testify against the people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and let the Lord GOD be a witness against you (ESV) <em>(BSB, ESV, KJV, NABRE, NASB, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions. In this context, this kind of jussive constructive (“and let…”) normally functions like an imperfect (non-past) verb.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NICOT (page 266), WBC (page 15), and A&amp;F (page 132) translate this clause as a jussive but give no justification. Waltke 2007 (page 45) and NET footnote (c) give reasons that support the majority of English versions.</span></span> With both interpretations, it is implied from 2:1a–b that the people should listen carefully to the Lord’s testimony against them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There is more than one way to interpret the relationship between Micah’s commands in 1:2a–b that the people listen and the statement in 1:2c that the Lord GOD would testify against them:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The connection is not explicit. It should be left implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Yahweh intends to give evidence against you (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Sovereign Lord will testify against you. (GNT) <em>(BSB, CEV, GW, NCV, NET, NJB, NLT, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The statement in 1:2c gives the reason why Micah told the people to listen in 1:2a–b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>for</u> I AM will become a witness against you<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Waltke 2007 (page 44).</span></span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The statement in 1:2c gives the purpose why the people should heed the commands in 1:2a–b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that the Sovereign Lord may witness against you (NIV) <em>(NIV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The Display will follow interpretation (1) along with most versions. It will leave the relationship unspecified. You may follow either interpretation (1) or (2). In many languages, a reason will be implied whether or not 1:2c is introduced with a word such as “for” or “because.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">One reason not to follow interpretation (3) is that a purpose word or phrase like “that” or “so that” may wrongly imply that if the people did not listen, the LORD would not testify.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Lord GOD:</strong> In Hebrew, this double name, <em>ʿadonay yhwh</em>, is used over 280 times in the Old Testament to refer to God. The word <em>ʿadonay</em> means “lord/master.” The word <em>yhwh</em> is God’s personal name.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions follow the tradition of using “LORD” instead of “Yahweh” (<em>yhwh</em>). Since it is awkward to have an expression such as Lord LORD, most English versions use one expression to indicate God’s authority and another one to translate his own name. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Sovereign Lord (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Lord GOD (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Almighty Lord (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See the note on “Yahweh, the LORD” in the Introduction.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>bear witness against you:</strong> This phrase is usually used in a courtroom. It figuratively describes God as a lawyer who is presenting a case in a trial. Micah told all people to listen to the evidence that God will present. This evidence will prove that all people were guilty of doing evil.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, this courtroom language may be confusing, because God is the judge as well as the lawyer. If this is true in your language, you may want to use a more general expression. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Almighty LORD accuses/judges you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Lord Yahweh will declare that what you have done wrong</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Lord from His holy temple:</strong> The word <em>Lord</em> here is <em>ʿadonay</em>, the same as in the first part of 1:2c. The Lord was in <em>His holy temple</em> when he spoke as a witness against the people. He would speak <em>from</em> that location.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase contains implied information from the first part of 1:2c. In some languages, it may be more natural to make this information explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Lord will be a witness from his holy temple. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Listen! He speaks from his holy temple. (adapted from GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His holy temple:</strong> This phrase refers here to heaven, the LORD’s dwelling place, not to the temple in Jerusalem. In 1:3, Micah described God leaving “his place” (“his home” in the NJB) and coming down to the earth. So it is logical that the phrase <em>His holy temple</em> in 1:2c also refers to heaven, the place where God lives. If possible, do not specify in your translation that the temple is in heaven or in Jerusalem.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>holy:</strong> God’s temple is called <em>holy</em> because it is special, set apart to be his dwelling place. In most languages, you will be able to use the same term for <em>holy</em> that you used for “holy temple” or “holy place” elsewhere in Scripture.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>temple:</strong> The Hebrew word that is translated here as <em>temple</em> refers to a large magnificent building. In some OT passages, it refers to a palace, the home of a king. In this verse, where it refers to the home of the great king, God, there is little practical difference between “palace” and <em>temple</em>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NIDOTTE (#2121). According to TWOT (#493), the Hebrew word <em>hekal</em> is a loan from Sumerian/Akkadian that occurs 80 times. It “essentially represents a king’s dwelling quarters, i.e. a palace.” NIDOTTE clarifies that it refers to “palace” in only 15 OT passages. TWOT agrees that “God’s true temple and throne are in heaven” and lists Micah 1:2 specifically in support of that statement.</span></span> Almost all English versions translate it as <em>temple</em>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Exceptions are the NET “his majestic palace” and NJPS “his holy abode.”</span></span> Here are some other ways to translate “his holy temple”:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>his holy house/home</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the holy place where he lives</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the special place that is set apart as his own home</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:2c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to combine the first and last phrases of this verse part.

In 1:3–4, he continued to use vivid, figurative language to describe the LORD’s coming. In 1:5, he warned the whole nation of Israel, naming both Samaria and Jerusalem, that the LORD would judge them because of their idolatry and other sins.

These shrines were called <em>high places</em> because people usually built them on the upper slopes or tops of hills or mountains.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Sometimes such shrines were called “high places” even if the shrine was in a valley (see Jeremiah 7:31). The Canaanite and Philistine people who lived near the Jews in Palestine worshiped their gods at high places (for example, see Numbers 33:52; Jeremiah 48:35). Later the Jews also began to worship at such high places. Sometimes they worshiped the LORD at high places, especially before the temple was built in Jerusalem (for example, see 1 Samuel 9:12; 1 Kings 3:3–4). Many Jews also began to worship the false gods that the Canaanites worshiped (for example, see 1 Kings 11:7; 22:43). This is one of the sins that Micah accused the Jews of in this book.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the context of the phrase “of the earth” and “the mountains” in v.4, the phrase <em>high places</em> probably refers primarily to the tops of hills and mountains. However, the mention in v.5 of the centers of idol worship in Samaria and Jerusalem probably also implies the LORD’s defeat of idol worship.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>WBC (page 17) and ZIBBC (pages 123–124) think that Micah also intended “high places” to refer to pagan places of worship. See EBC (pages 503–504) for succinct and coherent arguments in favor of both implications.</span></span> It is recommended that you translate this phrase in a general way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the high places of the earth (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the tops of the mountains (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>on the hills and mountains</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Do not use a phrase such as “the worship places of the earth” (GW) or “every pagan altar” (CEV) that can refer only to idol worship. It is recommended that you add a footnote that clarifies the two implied meanings. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Hebrew word used here means “high places.” Most scholars think that it refers here to hills or mountains. Some scholars think that it also refers to the pagan altars that were located there.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"></p>",

He began by telling the entire earth, with all its inhabitants, (1:2) to listen because the LORD would soon come down from heaven to accuse them. In 1:3–4, he continued to use vivid, figurative language to describe the LORD’s coming. In 1:5, he warned the whole nation of Israel, naming both Samaria and Jerusalem, that the LORD would judge them because of their idolatry and other sins. In the second paragraph (1:6–7), the speaker is the LORD. The LORD warned Samaria that he would completely destroy the city.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes have separate section headings for 1:2–7 and 1:8–16. Here are some other examples of section headings for 1:2–7:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Judgment on Samaria (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Judgment pronounced against Samaria (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Several other English versions use a section heading for 1:2–16. You may follow either pattern. Here are some other examples of section headings for 1:2–16:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Coming Destruction (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Grief over Samaria and Jerusalem (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The capital cities of Israel and Judah destroyed (GW)</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:5a–f</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse has six poetic lines. The first two lines give the reason for the coming judgment of the LORD that is described in 1:4a–d. In 1:5a–b, 1:5b restates the meaning of 1:5a. In 1:5c–d, the question in 1:5c repeats the person named in 1:5a, and the answer in 1:5d corresponds to the capital of the nation that bears his name. The question in 1:5e unexpectedly includes Judah as the southern part of the nation of Israel as a whole, and the answer in 1:5f corresponds to the capital of that southern part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5a</sup>All this is for the <u>transgression</u> of <strong>Jacob</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5b</sup>and the <u>sins</u> of <strong>the house of Israel</strong>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5c</sup>What is the <u>transgression</u> of <strong>Jacob</strong>?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5d</sup>Is it not <em>Samaria</em>?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5e</sup>And what is the <u>high place</u> of <strong>Judah</strong>?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5f</sup>Is it not <em>Jerusalem</em>?</p></blockquote><h4>1:5a–b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:5a–b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(combined/reordered)</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>All these things will happen because of the wicked disobedience of the descendants of Jacob, the people of Israel.</p></li><li><p>All this will happen because the people of Israel have sinned and rebelled against Yahweh.

(GNT) <em>(CEV, NCV, NIV, NJB, NLT, GNT)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Versions such as the NCV, NIV, and NJB have been listed here, because they do <u>not</u> connect the parallel parts or lines with the word “and” in a way that normally indicates two separate things.</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The parallel parts in these two lines refer to <u>different things</u>. The words “transgression” and “sins” seem to refer to different crimes or offenses. The name “Jacob” refers to the people of the <u>northern kingdom</u>, and “the house of Israel” refers to the people of the <u>southern kingdom</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>All this is because of Jacob’s rebellion and the sins of the nation of Israel.

It is more likely that both names refer to <u>all of Israel</u>, that is, all the Jews, both north and south. Micah used the name “Jacob” in ten other places in his book. In several verses, he used the names “Jacob” and “Israel” as parallel terms (besides 1:5, see also 2:12; 3:1; 3:8; 3:9). In these other verses “Jacob” and “Israel” do not refer to the northern and southern kingdoms, but rather both refer to all of the Jews.</span></span> Many commentaries follow this interpretation.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Commentaries agree that the name Israel is another name for Jacob. UBS, JFB, NICOT, and A&amp;F support the view that Israel and Judah are used together to represent the entire nation of Israel.

They had <u>rebelled</u> against the LORD. In some languages, it may be better to translate this with a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>All this has happened because Jacob’s descendants have rebelled <span data-bnType=\"implied\">against the LORD</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Jacob:</strong> <em>Jacob</em> is the name of Abraham’s grandson whom God later renamed Israel (see Genesis 35:10).

The word <em>sins</em> is a general word. It restates the more specific meaning of “rebellion” in 1:5a. In some languages, it may be better to translate 1:5b as a separate sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yes,</span> the people of Israel have sinned.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the house of Israel:</strong> The word <em>house</em> here means “nation” or “people.” Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Israelites</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the people of Israel</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the nation of Israel (NCV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:5a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The GNT (quoted above) gives an example where “Jacob” and “Israel” have been combined into one term.

(CEV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:5c–f</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">These four lines are rhetorical questions that made the audience think about the nature and cause of the rebellion of the Israelites. For Micah’s original hearers and readers, these rhetorical questions were vivid and emphatic. The four questions occur in two pairs. In each pair of questions, the second question answers the first question by asking another question that expects the answer “Yes.”</p><h4>1:5c–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>What is the transgression of Jacob? Is it not Samaria?:</strong> There are at least three ways to interpret the meaning of the first question:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “What (or who) is the <u>cause</u> of Jacob’s transgression?” or “Who is to blame for his crime?” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Who is to blame for Israel’s rebellion? Samaria, the capital city itself! (GNT) <em>(CEV, NLT, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “What transgression did Jacob commit?” or “What did Jacob do to transgress God’s laws?” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What is Jacob’s crime? Isn’t it Samaria? (GW) <em>(BSB, GW, KJV, NAB, NASB, NET, NIV, NJB, NJPS, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “What (or where) is the <u>place</u> of Jacob’s transgression?” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What is the place of Jacob’s sin?

It is the best way to understand the Hebrew text,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>What</em> is usually translated as “who.” JFB (page 586) says that the Hebrew is literally “Who is the transgression of Jacob?” and means “Who is its cause?” KD (page 427) says that this question means “Who is the author of Jacob’s transgression?”</span></span> and it is supported by a majority of commentaries.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Commentaries that support the first interpretation (the cause of the crime) include KD, UBS, JFB, WBC, NAC, and Waltke 2007.

He used the name “<u>Israel</u>” in 1:5b. He used “<u>Jacob</u>” in 1:5c. So the people who heard or read his prophecy probably expected him to use the name “Israel” again in 1:5e. But instead, he used the name “<u>Judah</u>.” The people in Judah considered the people in the northern kingdom (Israel) to be rebels against God. They were not surprised that God would punish the northern kingdom.

He began by telling the entire earth, with all its inhabitants, (1:2) to listen because the LORD would soon come down from heaven to accuse them. In 1:3–4, he continued to use vivid, figurative language to describe the LORD’s coming. In 1:5, he warned the whole nation of Israel, naming both Samaria and Jerusalem, that the LORD would judge them because of their idolatry and other sins. In the second paragraph (1:6–7), the speaker is the LORD. The LORD warned Samaria that he would completely destroy the city.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes have separate section headings for 1:2–7 and 1:8–16. Here are some other examples of section headings for 1:2–7:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Judgment on Samaria (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Judgment pronounced against Samaria (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Several other English versions use a section heading for 1:2–16. You may follow either pattern.

But in this paragraph (1:6–7), the LORD is the one who speaks. You may want to make this explicit in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So the Lord says, “I will make Samaria a pile of ruins… (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So I, the Lord, will make the city of Samaria a heap of ruins… (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Many modern English versions begin a new paragraph here at 1:6. Most English versions put quotation marks around 1:6–7 to show that someone is speaking.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The CEV translates 1:6 as an indirect quote: “So the Lord will leave Samaria in ruins…He will scatter its stones….”</span></span></p></div><h4>1:6a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:6a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Therefore I will make Samaria a heap of rubble in the open field,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Therefore <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yahweh says</span>: “I will cause Samaria to become a pile of rocks/ruins in an empty/open field.</p></li><li><p>¶ So <span data-bnType=\"implied\">this is what Yahweh says,</span> “<span data-bnType=\"implied\">Because of all these sins</span>, I will destroy <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the city of</span> Samaria.

In English, another way to introduce this result is to use the word “So” (NJB). Some versions leave it implied that 1:6a is a result. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will make Samaria a stone heap in the field. (NAB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a natural way in your language to clearly show that this paragraph is the result of the previous verse.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will make Samaria a heap of rubble in the open field:</strong> This line means that the LORD will destroy the city so that nothing is left except a pile of ruins in a rural area.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to historical records, the Assyrian army attacked and destroyed Samaria in 722 B.C.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a heap of rubble in the open field:</strong> This phrase refers to rocks and other debris that remain after the buildings and walls of a city are destroyed. The city and the surrounding area will become like <em>open field</em> that can be used for farming, specifically a place where people can plant vineyards (see 1:6b).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A&amp;F (page 177) say that it will “revert to agriculture.” Waltke 2007 (pages 51–53) says that it will return to “its formerly unsettled condition” and will “again become a place for planting vineyards.”</span></span> Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a ruin in the open country (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a pile of ruins in the open country (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a heap of ruins in an open field (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in ruins—merely an empty field (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>1:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>a planting area for a vineyard.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It will be a place/area to plant vineyards.</p></li><li><p>where people can plant <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and tend</span> grape plants/vines,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a planting area for a vineyard:</strong> Vineyards are fields where people plant and tend grape vines. Grapes are a kind of fruit from which wine and raisins are made. In languages that do not use a word such as vineyards, translators may use a phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a place where people can plant grape plants/vines</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you have translated terms for grapes or vineyards in other parts of the Bible, you should use the same terms here.</p><h4>1:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I will pour her stones into the valley</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I will cause the stones <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of its walls and buildings</span> to tumble down into the valley,</p></li><li><p>and I will roll/tumble the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">crumbled</span> stones down to the bottom of the mountain/hill.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will pour her stones into the valley:</strong> The main part of the city of Samaria was built on the upper part of a hill. The walls around the city and many of the buildings in the city were made of stones. The LORD will cause those stones to fall down to the valley that was downhill from the city.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>pour:</strong> In Hebrew, this verb is the same word that Micah used in 1:4b. There he used in the phrase “like waters <u>rushing down</u> a steep place.” Here in 1:6c, it is used of stones, not water. God will cause the stones to <u>roll</u> or <u>tumble</u> downhill. Here are some other ways to translate this verse part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will tumble the rubble of her stone walls down into the valley… (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will roll the stones of her walls into the valley below… (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>her stones:</strong> In Hebrew, the word for “city” is feminine, so some versions use the word <em>her</em> to refer to the stones that fell. Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>its stones (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the rubble of the city (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>valley:</strong> In Hebrew, this is a different word than the one used in 1:4b. The word used here in 1:6c refers in this context to the open area downhill from the city.

It is also the <u>result</u> of 1:6c. The LORD will cause the city’s stones to tumble down into the valley. As a result, he will uncover the city’s foundations. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will roll the stones of her walls into the valley below, exposing her foundations. (1:6c–d, NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>expose her foundations:</strong> In Hebrew, the word <em>expose</em> means “to strip something so that it is exposed and bare.” When the LORD destroys Samaria and its rocks roll down into the valley, the foundations of the city walls and buildings will be bare. They will have nothing on top of them.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Hebrew word that is translated as <em>expose</em> here is also used to describe stripping off a person’s clothes. Some scholars say that Micah’s words here picture Samaria as an immoral woman: God will strip her naked in public to punish and shame her.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>foundations:</strong> The <em>foundations</em> are the lowest parts of the city walls and buildings. The walls and buildings are built on top of the <em>foundations</em>. If there is no term for foundations in your language, here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>until the bottom layer of stones has nothing on top of it</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Then people will be able to see even the lowest layer of building stones.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"></p>",

The Jews were the LORD’s special people. In many Old Testament passages, when the Jews worshiped idols or other gods, the LORD compared them to prostitutes. A prostitute sleeps with other men, so she is unfaithful to her husband. In the same way, if the LORD’s people worshiped other gods, they were unfaithful to God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">During the time of Micah, the people who lived in some of the nations near Israel worshiped idols. In some of these nations, there were prostitutes who worked at the idol temples. People who came to worship the idols had sex with the prostitutes as part of their worship. The worshipers gave money and gifts to these prostitutes.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In the city of Samaria, the Jews also had built temples to worship idols. Temple prostitutes were probably part of their idol worship.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Commentaries that support this view include UBS, ABC, NAC, and Waltke 2007.</span></span></p><h4>1:7a–c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:7a–c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(combined/reordered)</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Samaria&apos;s idols will be smashed, and her wealth gained by prostitution will be destroyed by fire,</p></li><li><p>I will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">cause to be</span> smashed/destroyed all the idols/images in Samaria, and I will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">cause to be</span> completely burned all valuable things that the city and its people gained from their idolatry.</p></li></ul></div><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7a</sup>All her carved images will be smashed to pieces;</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7b</sup>all her wages will be burned in the fire,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7c</sup>and I will destroy all her idols.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The three parallel lines in 1:7a–c have similar meanings. Each statement begins with the word “all” to give extra emphasis. The LORD would destroy <u>all</u> the idols that the people in Samaria worshiped.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>All her carved images…all her wages…all her idols:</strong> The pronoun <em>her</em> used in these three phrases refers to the city of Samaria. Actually, these idols and images belonged to the people who lived in Samaria, not to the city itself. Refer to the city here in a natural way in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>all its idols,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>all the idols in the city</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>all of the idols that the people in Samaria worship</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>carved images…idols:</strong> In Hebrew, the words <em>carved images</em> in 1:7a and <em>idols</em> 1:7c both refer to objects that people made to worship. These idols could be carved out of rock or wood, or they could be made of metal. Some of them were overlaid with gold or silver.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A&amp;F (page 179) mention “wood carving, gilded or otherwise adorned with precious metal.” CBC (page 306) describes “statues of gods (or goddesses) carved from wood or stone (and sometimes overlaid with silver or gold).”</span></span> English versions translate these two words in various ways. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>idols…images (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>precious idols…images (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>carved figures…idols (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>idols…statues (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural to reorder and/or combine the sentences about <em>carved images</em> (1:7a) and <em>idols</em> (1:7c) into one or two sentences. See the General Comment on 1:7a–c at the end of 1:7c.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will be smashed to pieces…will be burned…I will destroy:</strong> In Hebrew, the passive verbs in the first two lines do not specify the one who beats and burns. Historically, it was the invading Assyrian army that did this. The third line specifies <em>I</em> as the one who lays waste. <u>The LORD</u> is the one who <u>causes all three things to be done</u>. In some languages, it may be more natural to translate all three verbs with the LORD (<em>I</em>) as the subject. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will smash into pieces…I will burn…I will destroy…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">cause</span> to be smashed into pieces…I will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">cause</span> to be burned…I will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">cause</span> to be destroyed…</p></blockquote><h4>1:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>All her carved images will be smashed to pieces;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>All her/its images will be smashed.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I will cause</span> all the idols to be broken into pieces.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>smashed to pieces:</strong> The Hebrew word for <em>smashed to pieces</em> means “to <u>smash</u> something,” “to <u>hit</u> it so that it breaks into pieces.” This word probably implies using a tool like a club.</p><h4>1:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>all her wages will be burned in the fire,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>All of Samaria’s earnings <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from prostitution</span> will be completely burned up,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I will cause</span> all the valuable things <span data-bnType=\"implied\">at their idol-worship places</span> to be put in a fire and burned.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>wages:</strong> In this context, the word <em>wages</em> may have both literal and figurative meanings. It may refer literally to the wages and expensive gifts that were paid to prostitutes. These earnings enriched the city of Samaria and its inhabitants. At the same time, it may refer figuratively to the city’s idols and the wealth that came from idolatry.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Commentaries that support a literal referent of temple prostitutes include ABC, UBS, CBC, NAC, and Waltke 2007. Hillers (page 20) suggests that the images used in worship in Samaria and the wealth assembled in the sanctuaries were contemptuously referred to as “whore’s fees.” “This is in part figurative (Yahweh as the husband of the faithless wife Israel). At the same time there is a literal component, in that sacred prostitution was practiced at the shrines.” IVPB (electronic edition, Micah 1:7) also mentions both figurative and literal options, though not necessarily occurring simultaneously.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">If possible, translate 1:7b, d, and e in a way that allows the word <em>wages</em> to be understood either literally or figuratively.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Samaria earned her money by being unfaithful to me</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all the gifts to her idols (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>burned in the fire:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase means “completely burned up.” In some languages, it may be redundant to specify <em>in the fire</em>.

The Lord will destroy the idols and valuable things in Samaria <u>because</u> the people had gathered them as a result of their worship of idols involving temple prostitutes. Some versions make a conjunction such as “for” explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for she collected them from a harlot’s earnings… (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Other versions, such as the BSB, do not translate the conjunction. They leave the connection implicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They were amassed out of prostitutes’ earnings (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Samaria acquired these things for its fertility rites (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Translate this in a natural way in your language to make the connection clear.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Since:</strong> In the Hebrew, the conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>Since</em> is at the beginning of 7e. This conjunction gives the <u>result</u> of 1:7d. The people gathered valuable things in their worship of idols, <u>and so</u> the LORD will cause those things to be taken away. Other people will use them to worship idols.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The BSB and some other English versions show the relationship between 1:7d and 1:7e by using a conjunction at the beginning of 1:7d. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>7d</sup> <u>Since</u> she gathered her gifts from the wages of prostitutes, <sup>7e</sup>as the wages of prostitutes they will again be used. (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The <u>emphasized word</u> in the above translation is the conjunction that makes 1:7d the reason and 1:7e the result.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be better to use a conjunction at the beginning of 1:7e. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>7d</sup>Samaria acquired these things for its fertility rites, <sup>7e</sup><u>and now</u> her enemies will carry them off for temple prostitutes elsewhere. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>she collected:</strong> The pronoun <em>she</em> refers to the city of <u>Samaria</u>. And Samaria represents the <u>people</u> who live in it. People brought money and other gifts to the idol temples in Samaria. The people in Samaria <em>collected</em> all these valuable things.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the wages of a prostitute:</strong> See the earlier note on 1:7d–e (first line) regarding the literal and figurative meanings of <em>wages</em>.</p><h4>1:7e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:7e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>they will be used again on a prostitute.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Similarly, in the future <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other people</span> will use those things to worship <span data-bnType=\"implied\">their own</span> idols.”</p></li><li><p>And so <span data-bnType=\"implied\">their enemies will take away</span> those things and also use them to worship idols.”</p></li><li><p>So that is why <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I will cause</span> those things to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">be carried away by their enemies, who</span> will use them to worship <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other</span> idols.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they will be used again on a prostitute:</strong> By these words, Micah implied that an enemy army would carry away the expensive things in the city that were used for idol worship and use them again for the same purpose.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Verses 1:7a–c have just described the smashing and burning of all idols and other expensive things, so it may be hard to understand how these things can be used again. One explanation is that the enemy soldiers stripped off the gold and silver coating before they smashed or burned the stone or wooden items.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NICOT (page 274), JFB (page 688), Waltke 2007 (page 54). Another explanation is that 1:7a–c and 1:7d–e are both poetic ways to refer to “the ending of the false worship, together with the destruction of the city where it was carried out. There is no real contradiction” (UBS, pages 135–137).</span></span> In some languages, it may be helpful to supply a footnote that gives this explanation.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"></p>",

In 1:6–7, he predicted that the LORD would destroy <u>Samaria</u>. Here in 1:8–16, he predicted that the LORD would also punish the people in Judah, including <u>Jerusalem</u>. He would punish them by causing an enemy army to invade Judah.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section has two paragraphs: 1:8–9 and 1:10–16. In the first paragraph, Micah said that he would “lament and wail” (BSB). He described the way that he would mourn and then gave the reason. In the second paragraph, he mentioned several cities in Judah that an enemy army would soon attack on its way to Jerusalem. Some versions have separate section headings for each paragraph. The Notes will include both paragraphs as part of the same section. Here are some other examples of section headings for the entire section (1:8–16):</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Lament for Jerusalem and the lowland towns (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Judah Is Doomed (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Doom of the Cities of Judah (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Micah mourned the disaster that will happen to various cities in Judah</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">If you choose to use separate section headings for 1:8–9 and 1:10–16, here are some examples for 1:8–9:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Weeping and Mourning (NIV, BSB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Micah’s Great Sadness (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Either the CEV or NRSV headings above will be appropriate for 1:10–16.

Then he described the disaster that would also happen to <u>Judah and Jerusalem</u> (1:9b–c).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In 1:6–7, the LORD was the speaker. But here in 1:8–9, <u>Micah</u> is the speaker. In some languages, it may be helpful to make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then Micah said, “Because of this I will mourn and lament.

For this reason, Micah will lament and wail. Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For this… (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And so,…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>That is the reason why…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will lament and wail:</strong> Most versions translate these verbs as future tense (<em>will</em>). Here are some other ways to express the meaning of the Hebrew verb tense here:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I lament and wail (NAB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I must lament and wail (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have decided to lament and wail</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>lament and wail:</strong> These verbs have almost the same meaning. They both refer to the Jewish custom of weeping in a loud voice and wailing loudly to show their sorrow. Micah used both verbs here to emphasize his sorrow. Here are some other examples of versions that use two similar verbs to express loud mourning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will weep and wail (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I shall howl and wail (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural to express this emphasis in a different way.

Micah said he will walk around <em>barefoot and naked</em> to show that he was very sad. In some languages, it may be helpful to make the meaning of Micah’s actions explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>To show my sorrow</u>, I will walk around barefoot and naked. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In other languages, it may be appropriate to supply a footnote that clarifies the meaning of the symbolic action. Here is an example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Micah did this to show how sad he was that the LORD planned to punish his people.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>barefoot:</strong> In Hebrew, there are two ways to interpret the word <em>barefoot</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means that Micah would not wear any <u>shoes or sandals</u> on his feet. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will walk around barefoot (GNT) <em>(BSB, CEV, GW, NAB, NET, NASB, NCV, NLT, NIV, NJB, NRSV, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means that Micah would not wear any <u>jewelry or good clothing</u>.

KD (page 292) explains that Micah was “not wearing an upper garment,” and JFB (page 688) adds that a “prophet’s upper garment was usually rough and coarse-haired.” Other commentaries that agree with interpretation (1) include NAC, NICOT, and WBC. A&amp;F prefer interpretation (2). On pages 193–194, they explain that “Nakedness suits a captive better than a mourner. So the balance is even. In v 16 a mother mourns her captured children; in v 8 the prophet mimes both captives and their mourners in one acted prophecy.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate interpretation (1):</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will walk around barefoot and wearing only a loincloth.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will walk around with no shoes and no shirt or sarong.</p></blockquote><h4>1:8c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:8c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I will howl like a jackal and mourn like an ostrich.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I will howl like a jackal and will raise my voice to moan like an ostrich.</p></li><li><p>I will wail.

I will make loud, harsh noises like ostriches.</p></li><li><p>I will wail and make loud, sad noises like some animals and birds.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In 1:8a, Micah said that he would “lament and wail.” Here in 1:8c, he used two similes to compare his lamenting and wailing to the noises made by two kinds of animals: jackals and ostriches. The following note on “howl” applies to both similes.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will howl:</strong> In Hebrew, the word the BSB translates as <em>howl</em> is a noun that is related to the verb “lament” in 1:8a. In some languages, it may be more natural to use a verb here in 1:8c too, as the BSB does. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will cry loudly… (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>like a jackal:</strong> In Hebrew, the word <em>jackal</em> is plural. Some versions translate it as plural, others as singular. Translate it in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">A jackal is a wild animal that resembles a wild dog. Jackals often howl at night. If there is no word for <em>jackal</em> in your language, you may be able to use the word for a similar kind of animal that makes a sad/lonely howling noise.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The KJV has “dragons.” No modern scholars follow this interpretation. A&amp;F (page 194) give the following explanation: “The reading in LXX of ‘dragons’ (cf. Vulgate) has confused the plural of <em>tan</em>, ‘jackal,’ with <em>tannîm</em> a variant of <em>tannin</em>.” Hillers (page 22) says: “The LXX <em>drakontōn</em> and the V <em>draconum</em> arise from confusion with <em>tannin</em>.”</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>like a wolf (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>like the wild dogs (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>like a pack of coyotes/hyenas</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and mourn like an ostrich:</strong> There are two main ways to interpret the meaning of the Hebrew word for <em>ostrich</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to an <u>ostrich</u>. This very large bird used to be found in Israel but is now found mainly in Africa. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will…wail like an ostrich. (GNT) <em>(BSB, CEV, ESV, GW, NAB, NASB, NJPS, NRSV, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to a kind of <u>owl</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I shall shriek like the owls (NJB) <em>(KJV, NCV, NET, NIV, NJB, NLT, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">TN will follow interpretation (1). You may follow either interpretation. Choose an interpretation that fits the terminology of your language and also has cultural associations with a loud, shrill, or harsh noise. Both interpretations are almost equally supported by translations and commentaries.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Commentaries that support interpretation (1) include Hillers, KD, WBC, ZIBBC, and JFB. Hillers (page 23) says that the ostrich gives a “loud, strident call.” KD (page 292) describes it as a “strong, mourning cry.” JFB (page 688) says that ostriches give a shrill and long-drawn, sigh-like cry, especially at night.” Commentaries that support interpretation (2) include NAC, Waltke 2007, EBC, CBC, ABC, and IVPB. NAC (pages 54–45) comments that the word is an “Arabic etymological cognate with the root idea of “desert.” So the entire Hebrew phrase (<em>ḇnôṯ yaʿănâ</em>) would mean literally “daughters of the desert,” hence “desert owls” or “eagle owls” or simply “owls” (REB “desert-owl”).” Waltke 2007 (pages 66–67) explains: The literal meaning of <em>ḇaṯ yaʿănâ</em>…is either ‘daughter of greed’ (Gesenius) or ‘the daughter of the wilderness’ (Wetzstein), and it has consequently been always explained as the ostrich (LXX, Vulg., Targ., Pesh.); for this bird is noted for its voracious appetite and is found only in the wilderness. Not all, however, that is said of this bird in the O.T. is applicable to the ostrich. This indeed inhabits the open wilderness…, but it does not haunt deserted or ruined cities; it certainly does not wail (Mic. 1:8) but booms; nor is it raptorial. These are all habits of owls, so that the <em>ḇaṯ yaʿănâ</em> may well be the eagle owl (Aharoni), a large owl which is found in semi-desert areas covered with scrub, where it rests on bushes during the day and hunts…by night.…The Syr. <em>ba(r)t yarora</em> (Pesh.) “daughter of the vomiter” (Mic. 1:8) agrees with the explanation of the word; for all owls bring up the indigestible parts of their food in the form of pellets…”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some questions to ask in deciding on an interpretation to follow:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>How do the major translations in your area or country translate the name of this bird?</p></li><li><p>What birds in your area are known for making loud, shrill, or harsh cries?</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Be sure to test your translation carefully for unexpected meanings. For example, in some parts of the world, people believe that owls are a sign (omen) of bad luck or disaster. In such areas, it may be better to refer to a different bird.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other options for translating <em>jackal</em> or <em>ostrich</em> (or “owls”):</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Borrow words from a language of wider communication. Then supply a footnote that explains the meaning. Here is an example footnote that explains jackals and owls:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In the thinking of the Jews, jackals and owls made loud, sad noises.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without using similes. Then supply the similes in a footnote. Here is an example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will wail and make sad noises. (Footnote: In Hebrew, it says: I will howl like the jackals and moan loudly like the ostriches.)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">If possible, use similes to keep the vividness that these figures of speech conveyed to the original audience.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"></p>",

He would also punish the land of Judah, including the city of Jerusalem.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The two parallel lines in 1:9b–c are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>9b</sup>it has reached even Judah;</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>9c</sup>it has approached the gate of my people, as far as Jerusalem itself.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Both lines refer to the southern kingdom of Judah. The second line refers specifically to the capital city, Jerusalem, the center of worship and government.</p><h4>1:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>it has reached even Judah;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For this disaster will also reach the land of Judah.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The same terrible thing</span> will certainly happen in the land of Judah as well.</p></li><li><p>And <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yahweh</span> will certainly <span data-bnType=\"implied\">cause</span> the people in Judah to be punished too.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In Hebrew, this portion of the verse begins with the same word (“For”) that was used in 1:9a. Since it is an additional part of the same reason, many English versions, including the BSB, do not translate this word. The connection is clear without an explicit conjunction. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it has come to Judah (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, the connection will be clearer with a specific word such as “for” or “and.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for it has come to Judah (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and Judah is about to suffer in the same way (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it has reached even Judah:</strong> This means that Samaria’s incurable wound will also come to the land of Judah. The LORD will certainly punish the people who live there. In some languages, it is not natural to say that punishment or disaster <u>reaches</u> a place. It may be more natural to say that it <u>happens</u> in a place or <u>arrives</u> at a place.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Micah spoke as if this disaster had already happened to Judah. He spoke like this to emphasize that the terrible things that will happen to Samaria will also certainly happen in the land of Judah.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Hebrew verb is a qal perfect. In Hebrew, perfect verbs usually refer to past events. But prophets often used perfect verbs to talk about something that was certain to happen in the future.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In many languages, it may be clearer to use a future expression here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Judah is about to suffer in the same way (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It will spread to Judah (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>1:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>it has approached the gate of my people, as far as Jerusalem itself.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It will happen to the main city of my own people, Jerusalem itself.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He</span> will even punish Jerusalem, the capital city of my countrymen!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it has approached the gate of my people, as far as Jerusalem itself:</strong> This line means that even the capital city of Judah, Jerusalem, will experience disaster along with other towns in Judah that will be mentioned in 1:10–16.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The verb tense used here is the same as in 1:9b. See the note and footnote there. Micah used it to emphasize that something would happen in the future. Here are some ways to indicate this future meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It will reach the gates of my people in Jerusalem. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Jerusalem will fall. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the gate of my people, as far as Jerusalem itself:</strong> There are two main ways to interpret the connection between the phrase <em>the gate of my people</em> and the phrase <em>as far as Jerusalem</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Micah used the word <em>gate</em> as a <u>metaphor</u>. It represents <u>the city of Jerusalem</u> itself. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It falls on the gateway of my people, on Jerusalem itself. (NJB) <em>(BSB, ESV, KJV, NAB, NASB, NIV, NJB, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Micah used the word <em>gate</em> <u>literally</u>. The disaster will reach <u>the gate of Jerusalem</u> itself.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to interpretation (2), Micah’s words refer to what happened in 701 B.C. In 721 B.C. the Assyrian army destroyed Samaria. Then in 201 B.C., the Assyrian army invaded Judah. They captured many towns in Judah. They surrounded Jerusalem and came right up to the city gate. But they did not conquer or destroy Jerusalem.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>destruction has reached the gates of Jerusalem itself, where my people live (GNT) <em>(GW, NCV, NLT, GNT)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>It is possible that NET refers here to the literal gate, although it gives “gate” a figurative meaning. It has “to the leadership of my people,” and adds a footnote that the word “gate” is used “by metonymy to refer to the leadership who would be present at the gate.”</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions and commentaries.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Commentaries that support interpretation (1) include UBS, NICOT, KD, A&amp;F, and Hillers. UBS (page 139) says that the phrase “the gate of my people” “is a picture of the capital city as the center and focus of national life.” A&amp;F (page 198) comments in greater detail: “Targum has the more familiar “gates,” but the other ancient versions support the singular of MT. If the intention was to report the investiture of Jerusalem in siege one might have expected “city gate” (2 Kgs 23:8); compare Isa 14:31, where the construct phrase “the gate of…the city” is broken and distributed over two colons of poetry. It is more likely, in the larger context of the chapter (especially if we read vv 2–9 as a unit) that the goal of the theophany announced in v 3 is “Yahweh’s triumphal entry into the temple precincts of the holy city Jerusalem” (Hanson 1975: 375).” Commentaries that support interpretation (2) include ABC and JFB. JFB (page 688) says: “The foe came to the gate of Jerusalem but did not enter.” ZIBBC (page 126) supports aspects of both interpretations. It says: “In one sense, the gate can stand for the whole city. Assyrian kings often set up memorial stones or impaled kings in front of the gate in order to reach the whole population in the most public terms possible, and they summarized times of siege by noting control over the ability to enter or exit the gate.” The TN editor could not determine which interpretation was followed by Waltke 2007 or NAC.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>gate:</strong> This word refers to the large gate or doorway in the fortified wall of a city. The city gate was an important place in a city. The city leaders met there to listen to disputes and to make decisions, and people did their buying and selling there also.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be clearer to translate this metaphor without using a figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This terrible thing will happen in the most important place among my people, in Jerusalem itself.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>my people:</strong> This phrase refers to the people who were part of the same country as Micah. Micah was from Moresheth, a small town in Judah, about 35 kilometers from Jerusalem. (see 1:1a). Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>my fellow citizens</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>my fellow people from Judah</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>people of my tribe/country</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a word or phrase in your language that refers to someone who is from the same country, ethnic group or language group as you, but not necessarily the same village or town.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Jerusalem itself:</strong> The name <em>Jerusalem</em> is emphatic in this verse. The BSB marks this with <em>itself</em>. Express this emphasis in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"></p>",

In 1:6–7, he predicted that the LORD would destroy <u>Samaria</u>. Here in 1:8–16, he predicted that the LORD would also punish the people in Judah, including <u>Jerusalem</u>. He would punish them by causing an enemy army to invade Judah.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section has two paragraphs: 1:8–9 and 1:10–16. In the first paragraph, Micah said that he would “lament and wail” (BSB). He described the way that he would mourn and then gave the reason. In the second paragraph, he mentioned several cities in Judah that an enemy army would soon attack on its way to Jerusalem. Some versions have separate section headings for each paragraph. The Notes will include both paragraphs as part of the same section. Here are some other examples of section headings for the entire section (1:8–16):</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Lament for Jerusalem and the lowland towns (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Judah Is Doomed (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Doom of the Cities of Judah (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Micah mourned the disaster that will happen to various cities in Judah</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">If you choose to use separate section headings for 1:8–9 and 1:10–16, here are some examples for 1:8–9:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Weeping and Mourning (NIV, BSB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Micah’s Great Sadness (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Either the CEV or NRSV headings above will be appropriate for 1:10–16.

These towns were located in the foothills between the low coastal area and the mountains of Judah.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>EBC (page 508). According to A&amp;F (page 212), some of the cities mentioned have not been identified, and it is not possible to guess the route of the attack or the identity of the invaders. It could have been any of several different kings.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">In many English versions as well as TN, 1:10–16 forms one paragraph. Some versions divide it into two or three paragraphs. For example, the GNT has two paragraphs (10–14 and 15–16). The NLT has three paragraphs (10–12, 13–15, and 16). Use whatever paragraph structure is appropriate for your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some of the poetic variations of Micah’s lament in 1:10–16:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>In some verses, he spoke <u>to</u> the people in a particular town. In other verses, he spoke <u>about</u> them.</p></li><li><p>Sometimes he used <u>plural</u> nouns or pronouns to refer to the people in a particular town. At other times, he used <u>singular</u> nouns or pronouns.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">English versions consistently use either plural or singular forms throughout these verses. For example, in 1:11b, the NJB uses singular pronouns:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>She</u> has not left her city, <u>she</u> who lives in Zanaan. (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The NIV uses a plural pronoun:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Those who live in Zaanan will not come out. (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">You may use either singular or plural forms or a combination of the two, depending on what is natural and appropriate in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In 1:10–16, Micah used past tense verbs to describe what was still in the future. See the notes on 1:9b and 1:9c for more details.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Micah also made puns with the names of several of the towns or cities. A pun is a figure of speech in which a person uses a word that has two meanings or a word that sounds like another word.</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>In some verses, he used a word that <u>sounded like the name</u> of that town.</p></li><li><p>In other verses, he said something about a town that was <u>related to the meaning of its name</u>.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">Here is a brief summary of the puns in each verse<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This summary is condensed and adapted from EBC (pages 407–8.)</span></span> and some general advice on how to translate puns. Complete notes on each verse will start with 1:10a.</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p><em>Beth-leaphrah</em> (1:10b): The name of this city sounds like the Hebrew words that mean “house of dust.” Micah commanded those who live in that town to roll in the <u>dust</u>.</p></li><li><p><em>Shaphir</em> (1:11a): This name means “beautiful” or “pleasant” in Hebrew. Micah said that the lives of the people in that town will not be <u>pleasant</u>.</p></li><li><p><em>Zaanan</em> (1:11b): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “come out.” Micah said that the people there will not <u>come out</u> of their city.</p></li><li><p><em>Beth-ezel</em> (1:11c): This name probably means “nearby house” in Hebrew. Micah said that Beth-ezel would no longer be nearby to serve as a “standing place” (protection, refuge) for Jerusalem.</p></li><li><p><em>Maroth</em> (1:12a): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “bitter.” Micah said that the people in that town will suffer <u>bitterly</u>.</p></li><li><p><em>Lachish</em> (1:13): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “team of <u>horses</u>.” Micah told the people in that town to flee like running <u>horses</u>.</p></li><li><p><em>Moresheth (-gath)</em> (1:14a): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “betrothed” (engaged to be married). Just like a young woman <u>departs</u> from her family when she gets married, so the people in that town would soon <u>depart</u> from Judah.</p></li><li><p><em>Achzib</em> (1:14b): This name means “deception” in Hebrew. That town will be a <u>deception</u> to the kings of Israel. These kings had hoped in vain that the people of Achzib would help them fight the enemy.</p></li><li><p><em>Mareshah</em> (1:15a): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “conqueror.” The LORD will bring an enemy to that town who will <u>conquer</u> them.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">In addition to the above puns, Micah also included the names of two places (Gath 1:10a) and Adullam (1:15b) that are famous in Jewish history. Their significance will be discussed in the notes on those verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The people to whom Micah spoke over 2,700 years ago understood the puns. They also understood the historical significance of Gath and Adullam. But most people today do not understand these things. That is the reason it is difficult to translate these verses clearly. Here are some general options to consider in translating the puns:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><u>Ignore the puns</u>. Most English versions do this in the actual translation. Just translate the name in the Hebrew text. Those who read your translation will understand the basic meaning of each verse, but they will not know that there was a pun in Hebrew.</p></li><li><p><u>Use footnotes to explain the puns</u>. Many English versions with footnotes do this. For example, the NIV uses footnotes at 1:10a, 11b, 12a, 13a, and 15a to explain that a name sounds like another Hebrew word. It uses other footnotes at 1:10b, 11a, and 14b to explain the meaning of the name of a town.</p></li><li><p><u>Explain in your translation</u> the meaning or the sound of the names for the cities. If you use this option, you will need to clearly indicate in some way that this information is not part of your translation.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Choose an option that is appropriate for the readers in your language area.</p></div><h4>1:10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Do not tell it in Gath; do not weep at all.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Don’t talk<sup>(plur)</sup> about this bad news in the city of Gath. Don’t weep at all, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">even though you are sad</span>.</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">People of Judah!</span> Don’t let <span data-bnType=\"implied\">our<sup>(incl)</sup> enemies</span> in Gath hear you talking about <span data-bnType=\"implied\">this disaster</span>. Do not weep <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about it</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Do not tell it in Gath:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Micah quoted the words “Tell it not in Gath” from 2 Samuel 1:20a, but he changed the order of the words. The Hebrew word order in 2 Samuel 1:20a is literally “Do not tell it in Gath.” In Micah 1:10a, the Hebrew word order is “In Gath do not tell it.” The result in Hebrew is that those words sound similar to the words of the next line “Weep not at all.” The NIV footnote says: “ <strong>Gath</strong> sounds like the Hebrew for <strong>tell</strong>.” (The Hebrew word is <em>nagad</em>). Here is the Hebrew for 1:10a: <em>bǝgat ʾal-taggidu</em>—In Gath do not tell [it]. <em>bakoh ʾal-tibku</em>—Do not weep at all.Notice that the three words of each line begin with <em>b</em>, <em>ʾ</em> and <em>t</em>, and that the vowels of each line are similar also.</span></span> Micah spoke the words in 1:10a to the people in Judah. In some languages, it may be helpful to make this information explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>You people of Judah!</u> Don’t tell our enemies in Gath how we have been defeated.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>it:</strong> This word refers to the news that God would punish his people. Some versions make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Don’t tell our enemies in Gath about our defeat (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Gath:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Instead of Gath, the NCV has Acco. It has a footnote that says: “[Acco] This name sounds like the Hebrew word for ‘cry.’” The NIV has the following footnote: “Septuagint may suggest ‘not in Acco.’” All other versions have Gath. JFB (pages 688–689) thinks that “Acco” is a good possibility because of the resemblance to the Hebrew word <em>bakoh</em> “weeping.” Waltke 2007 and NAC (page 57) give persuasive evidence, textual and otherwise, that the correct rendering is Gath.</span></span> <em>Gath</em> was one of the five main cities of the Philistines. The Philistines were enemies of the Jews. Some versions make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Don’t tell <u>our enemies in</u> Gath about our defeat (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In 2 Samuel 1:20–27, David sang a song to mourn the death of King Saul and Jonathan. David’s song began: “Tell it not in Gath.” David did not want anybody to tell the Philistine people in Gath about Saul’s death, because he did not want the Philistines to be happy about it. Micah deliberately quoted the first verse of David’s song here with a similar meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you use cross references in your translation, you may want to cross-reference that verse here. You may also want to include a footnote to explain some of the background information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Gath was a Philistine city (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The people in Gath were Philistines, enemies of the Jews. Micah did not want them to hear about the terrible things that would happen to the cities in Judah. He did not want them to be glad about it. This part of the verse is a quote from David’s words in 2 Samuel 1:20.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>do not weep at all:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase is literally “weeping do not weep.” This repetition gives additional emphasis. Here are some other ways to emphasize this command:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Don’t even cry. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Don’t shed even a single tear! (NET)</p></blockquote><h4>1:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Roll in the dust in Beth-leaphrah.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You<sup>(plur)</sup></span> in Beth-leaphrah, roll in the dust <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to show your despair</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">As for you</span> inhabitants of Beth-leaphrah, mourn <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because of what will happen</span>.</p></li><li><p>You people in Beth-leaphrah, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the name of your town means “house of dust,” so you will</span> roll in the dust <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because you are so sad</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Roll in the dust in Beth-leaphrah:</strong> Micah spoke these words to the people who lived in the city of <em>Beth-leaphrah</em>. The last part of the name <em>Beth-leaphrah</em> sounds like the Hebrew word for dust (<em>ʿapar</em>). Some scholars think that this name means “House of Dust.” Many English versions supply a footnote to explain this pun. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><strong>Beth Ophrah</strong> means <strong>house of dust</strong>. (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Beth-Leaphrah is unknown, but in Hebrew it sounds like “House of Dust.” (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you do not use footnotes, you may want to include this information in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You people in Beth-leaphrah! <span data-bnType=\"implied\">The name of your town means “house of dust,”</span> so you will roll in the dust.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Roll in the dust:</strong> This is a <u>symbolic action</u> that shows extreme sadness. When the Jews mourned, they sometimes scattered dust or ashes on their heads and bodies. Sometimes they lay down in the dust or ashes and rolled around to cover themselves with the substance.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If people who read your translation do not understand this symbolic action as a sign of mourning, you may want to make the purpose of the action explicit in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>People of Beth Leaphrah, <u>show your despair</u> by rolling in the dust! (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Another option is to use a footnote instead. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>To <em>sit in the dust</em> was an outward sign of mourning. The name <em>Beth Leaphra</em> means “house of dust.” (NET footnote)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Beth-leaphrah:</strong> The name of this town is spelled in several ways in English versions. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Bethleaphrah (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Beth Leaphrah (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Beth Leaphra (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Beth-Leaphrah (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Beth-le-aphrah (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Beth Ophrah (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Beth-aphrah (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You may want to use a spelling that fits the phonetic rules of your language or a spelling that is used in a language of wider communication in your country.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"></p>",

These towns were located in the foothills between the low coastal area and the mountains of Judah.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>EBC (page 508).

Some versions divide it into two or three paragraphs. For example, the GNT has two paragraphs (10–14 and 15–16). The NLT has three paragraphs (10–12, 13–15, and 16). Use whatever paragraph structure is appropriate for your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some of the poetic variations of Micah’s lament in 1:10–16:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>In some verses, he spoke <u>to</u> the people in a particular town. In other verses, he spoke <u>about</u> them.</p></li><li><p>Sometimes he used <u>plural</u> nouns or pronouns to refer to the people in a particular town. At other times, he used <u>singular</u> nouns or pronouns.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">English versions consistently use either plural or singular forms throughout these verses. For example, in 1:11b, the NJB uses singular pronouns:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>She</u> has not left her city, <u>she</u> who lives in Zanaan. (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The NIV uses a plural pronoun:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Those who live in Zaanan will not come out. (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">You may use either singular or plural forms or a combination of the two, depending on what is natural and appropriate in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In 1:10–16, Micah used past tense verbs to describe what was still in the future. See the notes on 1:9b and 1:9c for more details.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Micah also made puns with the names of several of the towns or cities. A pun is a figure of speech in which a person uses a word that has two meanings or a word that sounds like another word.</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>In some verses, he used a word that <u>sounded like the name</u> of that town.</p></li><li><p>In other verses, he said something about a town that was <u>related to the meaning of its name</u>.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">Here is a brief summary of the puns in each verse<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This summary is condensed and adapted from EBC (pages 407–8.)</span></span> and some general advice on how to translate puns. Complete notes on each verse will start with 1:10a.</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p><em>Beth-leaphrah</em> (1:10b): The name of this city sounds like the Hebrew words that mean “house of dust.” Micah commanded those who live in that town to roll in the <u>dust</u>.</p></li><li><p><em>Shaphir</em> (1:11a): This name means “beautiful” or “pleasant” in Hebrew. Micah said that the lives of the people in that town will not be <u>pleasant</u>.</p></li><li><p><em>Zaanan</em> (1:11b): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “come out.” Micah said that the people there will not <u>come out</u> of their city.</p></li><li><p><em>Beth-ezel</em> (1:11c): This name probably means “nearby house” in Hebrew. Micah said that Beth-ezel would no longer be nearby to serve as a “standing place” (protection, refuge) for Jerusalem.</p></li><li><p><em>Maroth</em> (1:12a): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “bitter.” Micah said that the people in that town will suffer <u>bitterly</u>.</p></li><li><p><em>Lachish</em> (1:13): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “team of <u>horses</u>.” Micah told the people in that town to flee like running <u>horses</u>.</p></li><li><p><em>Moresheth (-gath)</em> (1:14a): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “betrothed” (engaged to be married). Just like a young woman <u>departs</u> from her family when she gets married, so the people in that town would soon <u>depart</u> from Judah.</p></li><li><p><em>Achzib</em> (1:14b): This name means “deception” in Hebrew. That town will be a <u>deception</u> to the kings of Israel. These kings had hoped in vain that the people of Achzib would help them fight the enemy.</p></li><li><p><em>Mareshah</em> (1:15a): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “conqueror.” The LORD will bring an enemy to that town who will <u>conquer</u> them.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">In addition to the above puns, Micah also included the names of two places (Gath 1:10a) and Adullam (1:15b) that are famous in Jewish history. Their significance will be discussed in the notes on those verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The people to whom Micah spoke over 2,700 years ago understood the puns. They also understood the historical significance of Gath and Adullam. But most people today do not understand these things. That is the reason it is difficult to translate these verses clearly. Here are some general options to consider in translating the puns:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><u>Ignore the puns</u>. Most English versions do this in the actual translation. Just translate the name in the Hebrew text. Those who read your translation will understand the basic meaning of each verse, but they will not know that there was a pun in Hebrew.</p></li><li><p><u>Use footnotes to explain the puns</u>. Many English versions with footnotes do this. For example, the NIV uses footnotes at 1:10a, 11b, 12a, 13a, and 15a to explain that a name sounds like another Hebrew word. It uses other footnotes at 1:10b, 11a, and 14b to explain the meaning of the name of a town.</p></li><li><p><u>Explain in your translation</u> the meaning or the sound of the names for the cities. If you use this option, you will need to clearly indicate in some way that this information is not part of your translation.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Choose an option that is appropriate for the readers in your language area.</p></div><h4>1:11a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:11a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Depart in shameful nakedness, O dwellers of Shaphir.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You<sup>(plur)</sup> who live in Shaphir, you will leave your town <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as prisoners</span>, naked and ashamed.</p></li><li><p>O people of Shaphir, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">your enemies will capture you and force you to</span> leave your town. You will be naked and ashamed at the time you leave.</p></li><li><p>To the Shaphir people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I say</span>: <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the name of your town means “pleasant place,” but</span> you will leave that town <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as captives</span>. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Your enemies</span> will take off your clothes and shame you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Depart in shameful nakedness, O dwellers of Shaphir:</strong> Grammatically, Micah’s words <em>Depart in shameful nakedness…</em> are a command. However, his intention is not to command them to do something, but to predict what will happen to them. The people of Shaphir will be forced to leave their city in shame. In some languages, it may be clearer to express this as a future event. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You inhabitants of Shaphir! You will depart naked and ashamed.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">There is implied information in this verse. An enemy army will capture the people in Shaphir and take them away as slaves or as prisoners of war.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to make this implied information explicit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You people of Shaphir, go <u>into exile</u>, naked and ashamed. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You people of Shaphir, go <u>as captives into exile</u>—naked and ashamed. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Depart:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NJB understands that there is a pun between Shaphir and the Hebrew word <em>shop̄har</em> (“horn”). It has “Sound the horn, inhabitant of Shapir!” But this rendering would require changing the Hebrew text. It is not followed by other versions or supported by commentaries used in these notes.</span></span> In Hebrew, the verb phrase used here means that the people in Shaphir will leave their city. Here are some other ways to translate it:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Pass on your way (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Take to the road (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in shameful nakedness:</strong> In Hebrew, both these words are nouns (“nakedness and shame” (NRSV)). In many languages, it may be clearer to translate these nouns as <u>adjectives</u> or <u>verbs</u>. The BSB took a mixed approach. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>naked and ashamed (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Your captors will strip off your clothes and humiliate you.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">When the enemy army captures the people in Shaphir, they will strip off the people’s clothes and lead the people away as captives. That is why the people will be naked and ashamed.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Shaphir:</strong> This name means “beautiful” or “pleasant” in Hebrew. But what will happen there will <u>not</u> be pleasant. It will be horrible. You may want to use a footnote to explain the implied information in 1:11a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>1:11a <strong>Shaphir</strong> means “<strong>pleasant</strong>.” (NLT footnote)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The place name <em>Shaphir</em> means “pleasant” in Hebrew. (NET footnote)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See the third meaning line in the Display for a way to explain the meaning of the pun in the translation itself.</p><h4>1:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The dwellers of Zaanan will not come out.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Those who reside in Zaanan will not leave <span data-bnType=\"implied\">their town</span>.</p></li><li><p>As for the people in Zaanan, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the name of their town sounds like “come out,” but</span> they will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">be afraid to</span> come out, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because their enemies are outside</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The dwellers of Zaanan will not come out:</strong> In 1:11a, Micah talked <u>to</u> the people in Shaphir. But here in 1:11b, he talked <u>about</u> the people in Zaanan.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Zaanan:</strong> The name <em>Zaanan</em> sounds like the Hebrew word that means “come out” or “come forth.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The name <em>Zaanan</em> in Hebrew is <em>ṣaʾanan</em>, and “come out” is <em>yaṣʾah</em>. Both words have the consonants <em>ṣ</em> and <em>ʾ</em>.</span></span> But even though the name of their town sounds like “come out,” the people there will <u>not</u> come out. They will remain inside their town.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>All English versions except the REB follow the interpretation that the residents of Zaanan will not or cannot come out. The REB has: “Have not the people of Zaanan gone out in shame from their city?”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">You may want to use a footnote to make explicit the pun in 1:11b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>[Zanaan] This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “come out.” (NCV footnote)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be better to make this meaning explicit in the translation itself. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>As for the people in Zaanan, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the name of their town sounds like “come out,” but</span> they will not go out of their town.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>will not come out:</strong> Zaanan probably had a wall around the town. The phrase <em>will not come out</em> means that the people will not go outside the wall. Hebrew and most English versions do not supply a reason for their staying inside. The implied reason is that an enemy army will be outside, so the people will be unable or unwilling to face them. In some languages, it may be helpful to make a reason explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Those who live in Zaanan <u>do not dare</u> to come out of their city. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The residents of Zaanan <u>can’t</u> leave their city. (NET)</p></blockquote><h4>1:11c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:11c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Beth-ezel is in mourning; its support is taken from you.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The people of Beth-ezel will wail.

They will no longer be able to help you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">fight the enemy</span>.</p></li><li><p>The people in Beth-ezel will wail. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">The name of their city means “nearby house,” but</span> they will no longer be nearby to protect/help you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Beth-ezel is in mourning; its support is taken from you:</strong> There are at least three ways to interpret this sentence:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><u>Beth-ezel will no longer help protect</u> the people of Judah. It will withdraw its support, because it is in mourning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Beth Ezel is in mourning; it no longer protects you. (NIV11)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When you hear the people of Bethezel mourn, you will know that there is no refuge there. (GNT) <em>(BSB, GW, NCV, NIV11, NJPS, NRSV, REB, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p><u>Beth-ezel’s foundations will be destroyed</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Beth-Ezel is torn from its foundations, from its strong supports. (NJB) <em>(NJB, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Verse 1:11c is a direct quote. It is <u>what the people in Beth-ezel will say</u>:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The lamentation of Beth-ezel: “He will take from you its support.” (NASB) <em>(NASB, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions and commentaries.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Beth-ezel:</strong> The name of this town is spelled in several ways in different versions. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Beth-ezel (NJPS)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Beth Ezel (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Beth-Ezel (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Bethezel (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You may want to use a spelling that fits the phonetic rules of your language or a spelling that is used in a language of wider communication in your country.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The literal meaning of <em>Beth-ezel</em> in Hebrew is probably “house of nearness,” meaning “nearby house” or “house next door.” We do not know for sure whether Micah used a pun here. If he did, the probable meaning is that people in nearby towns hoped that the inhabitants of Beth-ezel would help them if an enemy attacked.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It may be helpful to use a footnote to help your readers understand the meaning of the possible pun. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>[Beth Ezel] This name means “house by the side of another,” suggesting help or support. (NCV footnote)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The place name <em>Beth Ezel</em> means “house of nearness” or “house of proximity” in Hebrew. (NET footnote)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you do not use footnotes, you may decide to include the meaning of the place and possible pun in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The people in Beth-ezel will wail. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">The name of their city means “nearby house,” but</span> they will no longer be nearby to protect/help you.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>its support is taken from you:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In Hebrew, the word that most versions translations as “support,” “protection,” or “refuge” is literally “standing place” (RSV, ESV). It is difficult to know what “standing place” would mean in this context.</span></span> Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>its protection is taken from you (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they will not give you any support (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you will know that there is no refuge there (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that the BSB and the NIV use a present tense verb. Remember that Micah spoke about a disaster that would happen to these cities in the future. When Micah spoke these words, this disaster had <u>not yet happened</u>. You should translate all the verses in 1:10–16 in a way that makes this meaning clear.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>from you:</strong> The pronoun <em>you</em> is plural in Hebrew. It probably refers to the people of Judah in general.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"></p>",

One way to express this certainty is to begin the verse with a word such as “Indeed.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>Indeed</u>, the residents of Maroth hope for something good to happen. (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Many English versions begin this verse with no connecting word. For some examples, see the NIV, GNT, and CEV quoted below.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Maroth:</strong> The name <em>Maroth</em> means “bitterness.” In Hebrew, bitterness was a symbol of sadness or unpleasant experiences. We do not know for sure whether Micah used a pun here. If he did, the probable meaning is that the people in Maroth “pined for good,” but what would happen to them would be <u>bitter</u>, that is, unpleasant.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to Mays 1976 (pp. 57–58), Micah made a word play on “Maroth” (bitter) and “good,”…and also on “evil” and “Jerusalem” (the city of shalom—“peace”): “How can the community of bitterness hope for the good of help when the evil of calamity has come from YHWH to the very gates of the city of salvation!”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The situation with the possible pun and its probable meaning is similar to the one with Beth-ezel in 1:11c. Consider using a similar approach here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It may be helpful to use a footnote to help your readers understand the meaning of the possible pun. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><em>Maroth</em> sounds like the Hebrew term for “bitter.” (NLT footnote)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The name <em>Maroth</em> means “bitter.” Eating bitter things is unpleasant. Similarly, unpleasant things will happen to the people in Maroth.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you do not use footnotes, you may decide to include the meaning of the place and possible pun in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The inhabitants of Maroth <span data-bnType=\"implied\">The name of their town means “bitter.”</span> will wait anxiously for someone to help them. Nothing good will happen to them.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>pined:</strong> In Hebrew, this verb phrase can be interpreted in at least three ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “wait anxiously.” The people of Maroth were worried. They were afraid that no one would help them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The people of Maroth anxiously wait for relief (GNT) <em>(BSB, ESV, GW, KJV, NCV, NET, NLT, NRSV, REB,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The REB indicates extreme anxiety. It has “in the depths of despair.” Conceivably, it could be listed with the NIV “writhe,” but being in deep despair does not necessary imply bodily contortions.</span></span> GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “writhe while waiting.” They twisted or contorted their bodies as they waited in extreme fear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Those who live in Maroth writhe in pain, waiting for relief… (NIV) <em>(NIV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “hope.” The people hoped that someone would help them and that good would result. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the residents of Maroth hope for something good to happen (NET) <em>(CEV, NET, NJPS)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions and commentaries. Interpretation (2) also implies that the people are extremely anxious, but the translation “writhe” requires an unusual form of the original word.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See A&amp;F (page 226) for a discussion of the confusing details.</span></span> The meaning “writhe” is not supported by any commentaries or other versions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">To “pine” means to wait for something to happen and to be anxious (worried and afraid) that it will not happen. In some languages, the expression <em>pined</em> may need to be translated as two clauses or as a direct quote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The inhabitants of Maroth wait for something good to happen, but they are worried/afraid that nothing good will happen.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The inhabitants of Maroth wait and wait. They say, “Will anything good ever happen?”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for good:</strong> The implied information here is that an enemy army will attack Judah. The people in “Maroth” wait anxiously for <u>good news</u> to come or for <u>something good</u> to happen. Here are some other ways to translate “wait anxiously for good”:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will be anxious for good news to come (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wait for something good to happen (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also the GNT (quoted above).</p><h4>1:12a–b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12a–b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(combined/reordered)</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Yahweh will cause disaster to come to the gate of Jerusalem.

In 1:12a, this word indicated certainty. Here in 1:12b, there are at least two ways to interpret its function:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It indicates either the <u>reason</u> that the people of Maroth wait anxiously or else the reason that nothing good will happen. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because trouble will come from the Lord, all the way to the gate of Jerusalem (NCV) <em>(ESV, GW, NAB, NASB, NCV, NIV, RSV, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It indicates <u>contrast or concession</u>. The people of Maroth wait anxiously, but/yet although that is the case, nothing good will happen. The reason is that even Jerusalem, the capital city, faced disaster and would need help. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>though</u> the Lord has sent disaster against the city of Jerusalem (NET) <em>(BSB, CEV, KJV, NET, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions. More commentaries follow interpretation (2), but this use of <em>ki</em> is extremely rare. The meaning “because” is much more common.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Commentaries that support interpretation (1) include ABC and UBS. ABC (page 1077) speaks of “a rescuing army from Jerusalem that will never come because the Assyrian army will march right up to the gate of Jerusalem .” UBS (page 146) comments: “it is even worse to have the enemies at Jerusalem than to have them in their own town, since it means there is no one left to send help and no place to which they can escape.” Commentaries that support interpretation (2) include WBC, JFB, NAC, and Waltke 2007. NAC (pages 58–59) explains: The suffering inhabitants of Maroth wait for ‘good’; instead, the Lord will send ‘disaster.’ Waltke 2007 (page 78) says that good represents “military aid, probably from Jerusalem; instead the Assyrian army marched right up to the gates of Jerusalem.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, the meaning of <em>ki</em> (“because”) may be clear without giving an explicit conjunction. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>From the Lord disaster will come on the gates of Jerusalem. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a natural way in your language to make the correct relationship clear.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>came down from the LORD:</strong> The verb <em>came down</em> is the same verb in Hebrew that Micah used in 1:3b (“the LORD…<u>will come down</u> and tread upon the high places of the earth”). Here in 1:12b, it means that the LORD will cause the disaster and that this disaster will soon happen.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may not be natural to say that a disaster <em>came down</em>. Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Lord has sent disaster against the gate of Jerusalem (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The LORD will cause a disaster to happen in front of the gate of Jerusalem.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>trouble will come from the Lord, all the way to the gate of Jerusalem (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to the gate of Jerusalem:</strong> In 1:9c, Micah said that the disaster would come “to the gate of my people, to Jerusalem.” Here in 1:12b, he used a shorter phrase, <em>to the gate of Jerusalem</em>. This phrase refers to the main gate in the wall around the city. An enemy army would normally come to the gate in order to break it down and enter the city.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This event probably happened when Hezekiah was king of Judah in 701 B.C. The Assyrian army came to the city gate of Jerusalem and surrounded the city, but they did not conquer it.</span></span> Several years after Micah said this, an enemy army did come to Jerusalem and attacked the city. For more details, see 2 Chronicles 32:1–22 and Isaiah 36:1–37:38.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:12a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to reverse the order of 1:12a and 1:12b.

In 1:6–7, he predicted that the LORD would destroy <u>Samaria</u>. Here in 1:8–16, he predicted that the LORD would also punish the people in Judah, including <u>Jerusalem</u>. He would punish them by causing an enemy army to invade Judah.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section has two paragraphs: 1:8–9 and 1:10–16. In the first paragraph, Micah said that he would “lament and wail” (BSB). He described the way that he would mourn and then gave the reason. In the second paragraph, he mentioned several cities in Judah that an enemy army would soon attack on its way to Jerusalem. Some versions have separate section headings for each paragraph. The Notes will include both paragraphs as part of the same section. Here are some other examples of section headings for the entire section (1:8–16):</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Lament for Jerusalem and the lowland towns (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Judah Is Doomed (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Doom of the Cities of Judah (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Micah mourned the disaster that will happen to various cities in Judah</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">If you choose to use separate section headings for 1:8–9 and 1:10–16, here are some examples for 1:8–9:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Weeping and Mourning (NIV, BSB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Micah’s Great Sadness (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Either the CEV or NRSV headings above will be appropriate for 1:10–16. Here is another example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Disaster will happen to various cities in Judah</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1033001010\" data-endVerseId=\"1033001016\"><h3>Paragraph 1:10–16</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, Micah mentioned the names of eleven towns in Judah in addition to the city of Jerusalem (v.12). These towns were located in the foothills between the low coastal area and the mountains of Judah.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>EBC (page 508). According to A&amp;F (page 212), some of the cities mentioned have not been identified, and it is not possible to guess the route of the attack or the identity of the invaders. It could have been any of several different kings.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">In many English versions as well as TN, 1:10–16 forms one paragraph. Some versions divide it into two or three paragraphs. For example, the GNT has two paragraphs (10–14 and 15–16). The NLT has three paragraphs (10–12, 13–15, and 16). Use whatever paragraph structure is appropriate for your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some of the poetic variations of Micah’s lament in 1:10–16:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>In some verses, he spoke <u>to</u> the people in a particular town. In other verses, he spoke <u>about</u> them.</p></li><li><p>Sometimes he used <u>plural</u> nouns or pronouns to refer to the people in a particular town. At other times, he used <u>singular</u> nouns or pronouns.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">English versions consistently use either plural or singular forms throughout these verses. For example, in 1:11b, the NJB uses singular pronouns:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>She</u> has not left her city, <u>she</u> who lives in Zanaan. (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The NIV uses a plural pronoun:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Those who live in Zaanan will not come out. (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">You may use either singular or plural forms or a combination of the two, depending on what is natural and appropriate in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In 1:10–16, Micah used past tense verbs to describe what was still in the future. See the notes on 1:9b and 1:9c for more details.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Micah also made puns with the names of several of the towns or cities. A pun is a figure of speech in which a person uses a word that has two meanings or a word that sounds like another word.</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>In some verses, he used a word that <u>sounded like the name</u> of that town.</p></li><li><p>In other verses, he said something about a town that was <u>related to the meaning of its name</u>.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">Here is a brief summary of the puns in each verse<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This summary is condensed and adapted from EBC (pages 407–8.)</span></span> and some general advice on how to translate puns. Complete notes on each verse will start with 1:10a.</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p><em>Beth-leaphrah</em> (1:10b): The name of this city sounds like the Hebrew words that mean “house of dust.” Micah commanded those who live in that town to roll in the <u>dust</u>.</p></li><li><p><em>Shaphir</em> (1:11a): This name means “beautiful” or “pleasant” in Hebrew. Micah said that the lives of the people in that town will not be <u>pleasant</u>.</p></li><li><p><em>Zaanan</em> (1:11b): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “come out.” Micah said that the people there will not <u>come out</u> of their city.</p></li><li><p><em>Beth-ezel</em> (1:11c): This name probably means “nearby house” in Hebrew. Micah said that Beth-ezel would no longer be nearby to serve as a “standing place” (protection, refuge) for Jerusalem.</p></li><li><p><em>Maroth</em> (1:12a): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “bitter.” Micah said that the people in that town will suffer <u>bitterly</u>.</p></li><li><p><em>Lachish</em> (1:13): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “team of <u>horses</u>.” Micah told the people in that town to flee like running <u>horses</u>.</p></li><li><p><em>Moresheth (-gath)</em> (1:14a): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “betrothed” (engaged to be married). Just like a young woman <u>departs</u> from her family when she gets married, so the people in that town would soon <u>depart</u> from Judah.</p></li><li><p><em>Achzib</em> (1:14b): This name means “deception” in Hebrew. That town will be a <u>deception</u> to the kings of Israel. These kings had hoped in vain that the people of Achzib would help them fight the enemy.</p></li><li><p><em>Mareshah</em> (1:15a): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “conqueror.” The LORD will bring an enemy to that town who will <u>conquer</u> them.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">In addition to the above puns, Micah also included the names of two places (Gath 1:10a) and Adullam (1:15b) that are famous in Jewish history. Their significance will be discussed in the notes on those verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The people to whom Micah spoke over 2,700 years ago understood the puns. They also understood the historical significance of Gath and Adullam. But most people today do not understand these things. That is the reason it is difficult to translate these verses clearly. Here are some general options to consider in translating the puns:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><u>Ignore the puns</u>. Most English versions do this in the actual translation. Just translate the name in the Hebrew text. Those who read your translation will understand the basic meaning of each verse, but they will not know that there was a pun in Hebrew.</p></li><li><p><u>Use footnotes to explain the puns</u>. Many English versions with footnotes do this. For example, the NIV uses footnotes at 1:10a, 11b, 12a, 13a, and 15a to explain that a name sounds like another Hebrew word. It uses other footnotes at 1:10b, 11a, and 14b to explain the meaning of the name of a town.</p></li><li><p><u>Explain in your translation</u> the meaning or the sound of the names for the cities. If you use this option, you will need to clearly indicate in some way that this information is not part of your translation.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Choose an option that is appropriate for the readers in your language area.</p></div><h4>1:13a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Harness your chariot horses, O dweller of Lachish.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Tie<sup>(plur)</sup> horses to the chariots, you people of Lachish!</p></li><li><p>You people of Lachish!

That means that there were soldiers, horses, chariots, and other fighting equipment in the town.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are two ways to interpret Micah’s words in this verse part:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The inhabitants should <u>prepare to flee from the enemy</u>. They should ride in chariots to get away. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Harness your chariot horses and flee</u>, you people of Lachish. (NLT) <em>(NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The inhabitants should <u>prepare to fight the enemy</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Get the war chariots ready</u>, you people of Lachish. (CEV) <em>(CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Almost all commentaries clearly support interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>It is possible that WBC supports interpretation (2). His translation is ambiguous, but in the comment section (pages 20–21), he says “the horses in Lachish were to be harnessed to the chariots because the day of battle has come.”</span></span> Most English versions are ambiguous. They say only that the people should harness the horses to the chariots. It is recommended that you leave the purpose for harnessing the horses implicit if possible. If that is not possible in your language, you should follow interpretation (1). The first two meaning lines in the Display will leave the purpose implied. The third meaning line will make it explicit.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Harness your chariot horses:</strong> In Hebrew, this clause is literally “Harness the chariot to the steed.” Most English versions reverse this order (“Harness the steeds to the chariots” (NRSV)). Use whatever order is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Micah used the definite article “the” two times in this sentence: “Harness <u>the</u> steeds to <u>the</u> chariots.” He was referring to the horses and chariots that were in Lachish. In some languages, it may be better to use the pronoun <em>your</em> or to not use a definite article. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>People in Lachish! Tie horses to your<sup>(plur)</sup> chariots.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Another example is the NLT (quoted above).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In Hebrew, “steed” and “chariot” are singular. Perhaps Micah used these singular words to refer to each horse or team of horses that pulled a chariot. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>harness the team to the chariot (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Harness the chariot to the team of horses (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Most versions uses plural forms. Use whatever is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Harness:</strong> This word means “to <u>tie</u> or <u>fasten</u> horses to the chariots.” People tied special ropes or straps on the horses and tied these ropes to the chariot. The horses pulled the chariot. Here is another way to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p><u>hitch</u> the horses to the chariots (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>chariot horses:</strong> This phrase refers to a team of two or more horses that worked together to pull a chariot. See the NIV, NASB, and GNT (quoted above) for some ways to translate this phrase.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>chariot:</strong> The word <em>chariot</em> refers to two-wheeled carts pulled by one or more horses. One or more people rode in a chariot. In languages that do not use a specific word such as <em>chariot</em>, it may be possible to use a general term such as “carts” or “war carts.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some areas, people do not know about horses and chariots. If that is true in your area, you may want to translate the implied purpose in interpretation (1) without mentioning either of these words. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You people in Lachish! <u>Prepare to flee from your enemies</u>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>horses…Lachish:</strong> Micah made a pun in this sentence. In Hebrew, the word translated as <em>horses</em> sounds like the name of the city <em>Lachish</em>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In Hebrew, the name Lachish is <em>lakiš</em>, and the word “steed(s)” is <em>larekeš</em>.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">You may want to use a footnote to help your readers understand this pun. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><em>Lachish</em> sounds like the Hebrew term for “team of horses.” (NLT footnote)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you do not use footnotes, you may decide to include the meanings of the place and the pun in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And you who live in Lachish, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the name of your town sounds like “horses,” so</span> fasten your horses to your chariots.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>O dweller of Lachish:</strong> In Hebrew, these words are <u>at the end of the sentence</u>. In some languages, this may be the natural place to put these words. In other languages, it may be more natural to put this phrase <u>at the beginning of the sentence</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You who live in Lachish, harness the team to the chariot. (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Put this phrase in a place that is natural in your language.</p><h4>1:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>You were the beginning of sin to the Daughter of Zion,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You<sup>(plur)</sup> were the first people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Judah</span> to encourage the people in Zion to sin.</p></li><li><p>You were the ones who first influenced the people in Jerusalem to sin.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You were the beginning of sin to the Daughter of Zion:</strong> In this sentence, Micah said that the people of Lachish were the beginning of sin to the people of Jerusalem.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>You:</strong> In Hebrew, this pronoun is either “she” or “it.” The pronoun refers to Lachish in 1:13a.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The pronoun “she” or “it” refers to the city of Lachish. Most scholars think it means the people in Lachish. Most English versions change the pronoun to “you” to make it agree with the rest of the verse.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the beginning of sin:</strong> Lachish was <em>the beginning of sin</em> to Jerusalem in the sense that the people of Lachish were the <u>first ones</u> to lead (encourage, influence) the people of Jerusalem to do a certain sin. Here are some other ways to translate 1:13b:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You were the <u>first to lead</u> the people of Zion into sin. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Jerusalem’s sins <u>started</u> in you (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You <u>influenced</u> Daughter Zion to sin (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>sin:</strong> Micah did not specify a particular sin. Almost all English versions leave the kind of sin implied.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NLT96 is an exception. It has “You were the first city in Judah to follow Israel <u>in the sin of idol worship</u>, and so you led Jerusalem into sin.”</span></span> Commentaries interpret the nature of the sin in two main ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The sin was <u>idolatry</u>, including the worship of Baal.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The northern kingdom’s first king, Jeroboam, began idol worship in Israel (cf. 1 Kings 16:26, 22:52–53), and idol worship in that nation became common. Although Israel had its own centers of worship, many people still traveled to the temple in Jerusalem and influenced them to worship idols in the temple there.</span></span></p></li><li><p>The sin was <u>relying on military power instead of God</u>.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is likely that some of the people were guilty of one or both of these sins. Commentaries slightly favor interpretation (1), but it is recommended that you use a general word for sin and leave the specific sin implied.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Commentaries that favor interpretation (2) include Waltke 2007, NAC, and ZIBBC. NAC (page 59) says: “The NIrV seems to capture the intended sense: ‘You trust in military power. / That was the beginning of sin / for the people of Zion…’ It is instructive that ‘military power’ (horses and war chariots) would be demolished by the Lord (5:10).” Commentaries that favor interpretation (1) include A&amp;F, WBC, JFB, and TOTC. JFB (page 689) says: “As lying near the border of the north kingdom, Lachish was first to be infected by its [Israel’s] idolatry, which thence spread to Jerusalem.” According to A&amp;F (page 230), “ ‘She’ is the goddess whose image and cult were exported from Samaria to various other places and that the capital sin of the north (idolatry) reached Jerusalem via Lachish. The sin was setting up idols (and precisely idols of that goddess) in the high places of Judah (v 5)…The best sense we can make out of Micah 1:13 is that it documents the spread of a serious sin from Samaria to Jerusalem.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">If your translation uses footnotes, you may want supply a footnote that summarizes the specific sins that were probably implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The sin that Micah was talking about was probably the sin of worshiping idols, specifically Baal (see 1 Kings 16:26–32). But the sin may also have been that Lachish led the nation to trust the power of war chariots instead of the LORD.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Daughter of Zion:</strong> This phrase is a poetic way to refer to the people who live in Jerusalem.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>One of the hills on which Jerusalem was built was called <em>Zion</em>, and the temple was on that hill, so the Jews used the name <em>Zion</em> as another name for Jerusalem. In Hebrew, the word for “city” is feminine, so Hebrew prophets and poets sometimes personified the city as a woman and the people who lived there as her daughter. The phrase <em>Daughter of Zion</em> occurs four times in the book of Micah: 1:13; 4:8; 4:10; and 4:13.</span></span> Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Jerusalem (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the people of Jerusalem</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the people of Zion (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you use a translation like one of these, you may want to use a footnote to give the literal translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Hebrew: <em>the daughter of Zion</em> (NLT footnote)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>1:13b “the people of Jerusalem.” What it says in Hebrew is: <em>the daughter of Zion</em>.</p></blockquote><h4>1:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for the transgressions of Israel were found in you.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For you<sup>(plur)</sup> are guilty of the same crime as the Israel people.</p></li><li><p>You broke <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> law in the same way that the people in Israel did.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I say this is</span> because you rebelled <span data-bnType=\"implied\">against God</span>, just like the people of Israel rebelled.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for:</strong> This word (<em>ki</em> in Hebrew) is a conjunction that marks a <u>reason</u>. Micah used it here to give <u>evidence</u> for what he said in 1:13b.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NCV translates this conjunction as “yes”: “Jerusalem’s sins started in you; yes, Israel’s sins were found in you.” According to this interpretation, 1:13b and c are <u>parallel lines of poetry that have similar meaning</u>. This is a possible interpretation, and the NJB, for example, ends this line with an exclamation mark. But most English versions clearly interpret 1:13c as the <u>evidence</u> for 1:13b.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Because</u> (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions leave the reason implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the crimes of Israel can be traced to you (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural to change the order of the clauses so that the reason precedes the result. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You imitated the sins of Israel <u>and so</u> caused Jerusalem to sin.

In 1:6–7, he predicted that the LORD would destroy <u>Samaria</u>. Here in 1:8–16, he predicted that the LORD would also punish the people in Judah, including <u>Jerusalem</u>. He would punish them by causing an enemy army to invade Judah.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section has two paragraphs: 1:8–9 and 1:10–16. In the first paragraph, Micah said that he would “lament and wail” (BSB). He described the way that he would mourn and then gave the reason. In the second paragraph, he mentioned several cities in Judah that an enemy army would soon attack on its way to Jerusalem. Some versions have separate section headings for each paragraph. The Notes will include both paragraphs as part of the same section. Here are some other examples of section headings for the entire section (1:8–16):</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Lament for Jerusalem and the lowland towns (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Judah Is Doomed (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Doom of the Cities of Judah (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Micah mourned the disaster that will happen to various cities in Judah</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">If you choose to use separate section headings for 1:8–9 and 1:10–16, here are some examples for 1:8–9:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Weeping and Mourning (NIV, BSB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Micah’s Great Sadness (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Either the CEV or NRSV headings above will be appropriate for 1:10–16. Here is another example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Disaster will happen to various cities in Judah</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1033001010\" data-endVerseId=\"1033001016\"><h3>Paragraph 1:10–16</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, Micah mentioned the names of eleven towns in Judah in addition to the city of Jerusalem (v.12). These towns were located in the foothills between the low coastal area and the mountains of Judah.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>EBC (page 508). According to A&amp;F (page 212), some of the cities mentioned have not been identified, and it is not possible to guess the route of the attack or the identity of the invaders. It could have been any of several different kings.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">In many English versions as well as TN, 1:10–16 forms one paragraph. Some versions divide it into two or three paragraphs. For example, the GNT has two paragraphs (10–14 and 15–16). The NLT has three paragraphs (10–12, 13–15, and 16). Use whatever paragraph structure is appropriate for your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some of the poetic variations of Micah’s lament in 1:10–16:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>In some verses, he spoke <u>to</u> the people in a particular town. In other verses, he spoke <u>about</u> them.</p></li><li><p>Sometimes he used <u>plural</u> nouns or pronouns to refer to the people in a particular town. At other times, he used <u>singular</u> nouns or pronouns.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">English versions consistently use either plural or singular forms throughout these verses. For example, in 1:11b, the NJB uses singular pronouns:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>She</u> has not left her city, <u>she</u> who lives in Zanaan. (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The NIV uses a plural pronoun:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Those who live in Zaanan will not come out. (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">You may use either singular or plural forms or a combination of the two, depending on what is natural and appropriate in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In 1:10–16, Micah used past tense verbs to describe what was still in the future. See the notes on 1:9b and 1:9c for more details.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Micah also made puns with the names of several of the towns or cities. A pun is a figure of speech in which a person uses a word that has two meanings or a word that sounds like another word.</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>In some verses, he used a word that <u>sounded like the name</u> of that town.</p></li><li><p>In other verses, he said something about a town that was <u>related to the meaning of its name</u>.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">Here is a brief summary of the puns in each verse<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This summary is condensed and adapted from EBC (pages 407–8.)</span></span> and some general advice on how to translate puns. Complete notes on each verse will start with 1:10a.</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p><em>Beth-leaphrah</em> (1:10b): The name of this city sounds like the Hebrew words that mean “house of dust.” Micah commanded those who live in that town to roll in the <u>dust</u>.</p></li><li><p><em>Shaphir</em> (1:11a): This name means “beautiful” or “pleasant” in Hebrew. Micah said that the lives of the people in that town will not be <u>pleasant</u>.</p></li><li><p><em>Zaanan</em> (1:11b): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “come out.” Micah said that the people there will not <u>come out</u> of their city.</p></li><li><p><em>Beth-ezel</em> (1:11c): This name probably means “nearby house” in Hebrew. Micah said that Beth-ezel would no longer be nearby to serve as a “standing place” (protection, refuge) for Jerusalem.</p></li><li><p><em>Maroth</em> (1:12a): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “bitter.” Micah said that the people in that town will suffer <u>bitterly</u>.</p></li><li><p><em>Lachish</em> (1:13): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “team of <u>horses</u>.” Micah told the people in that town to flee like running <u>horses</u>.</p></li><li><p><em>Moresheth (-gath)</em> (1:14a): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “betrothed” (engaged to be married). Just like a young woman <u>departs</u> from her family when she gets married, so the people in that town would soon <u>depart</u> from Judah.</p></li><li><p><em>Achzib</em> (1:14b): This name means “deception” in Hebrew. That town will be a <u>deception</u> to the kings of Israel. These kings had hoped in vain that the people of Achzib would help them fight the enemy.</p></li><li><p><em>Mareshah</em> (1:15a): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “conqueror.” The LORD will bring an enemy to that town who will <u>conquer</u> them.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">In addition to the above puns, Micah also included the names of two places (Gath 1:10a) and Adullam (1:15b) that are famous in Jewish history. Their significance will be discussed in the notes on those verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The people to whom Micah spoke over 2,700 years ago understood the puns. They also understood the historical significance of Gath and Adullam. But most people today do not understand these things. That is the reason it is difficult to translate these verses clearly. Here are some general options to consider in translating the puns:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><u>Ignore the puns</u>. Most English versions do this in the actual translation. Just translate the name in the Hebrew text. Those who read your translation will understand the basic meaning of each verse, but they will not know that there was a pun in Hebrew.</p></li><li><p><u>Use footnotes to explain the puns</u>. Many English versions with footnotes do this. For example, the NIV uses footnotes at 1:10a, 11b, 12a, 13a, and 15a to explain that a name sounds like another Hebrew word. It uses other footnotes at 1:10b, 11a, and 14b to explain the meaning of the name of a town.</p></li><li><p><u>Explain in your translation</u> the meaning or the sound of the names for the cities. If you use this option, you will need to clearly indicate in some way that this information is not part of your translation.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Choose an option that is appropriate for the readers in your language area.</p></div><h4>1:14a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:14a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Therefore, send farewell gifts to Moresheth-gath;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Therefore you<sup>(plur)</sup> will give a farewell gift to Moresheth-gath.</p></li><li><p>So you must give good-bye gifts to the people of Moresheth-gath.</p></li><li><p>And so, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you people of Judah,</span> you will say good-bye to those who live in Moresheth-gath, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for they will be taken away</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by their enemies</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Therefore, send farewell gifts to Moresheth-gath:</strong> In this verse part, Micah talked about Moresheth-gath, another small town in Judah.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Therefore:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the connection of the word <em>Therefore</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>What Micah said about Moresheth-gath is the <u>result</u> of what he said in the previous verse. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And so (NJB) <em>(BSB, ESV, GW, KJV, NAB, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, NJB, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>What Micah said about Moresheth-gath is the <u>next thing</u> he said in his list of comments to cities in Judah.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And now (GNT) <em>(CEV, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most English versions. The people in Jerusalem and Judah had begun to sin just like the northern kingdom. <u>Therefore</u> they must say good-bye to the people in Moresheth-gath. Here is another way to translate this connection:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>That is why (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this connection in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>send farewell gifts to Moresheth-gath:</strong> Micah made a pun here. The name “Moresheth” sounds like the Hebrew word for <u>fiancée</u>. In the Jewish culture, parents gave their engaged daughter a special gift at the time she left their home to go live with her husband.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Micah’s pun means that an enemy army will capture the city of Moresheth-gath and take the people away as captives. The people are like a daughter that will soon leave home. The other people in Judah will soon no longer see them. It is not recommended that you make this pun explicit in the translation itself.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you use footnotes in your translation, here are some sample footnotes:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><strong>1.14a</strong> <em>Moresheth</em> sounds like the Hebrew term for “gift” or “dowry.” (NLT footnote)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><strong>1.14 farewell gift</strong>: The gift (dowry) that a bride’s father gave her when she left the home of her parents to live with the family of her husband. In Hebrew the word for “bride” or “fiancée” sounds like “Moresheth.” (CEV footnote)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate 1:14a without a figure of speech:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And so, people of Judah, you will say good-bye to the town of Moresheth Gath. (based on GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So wave good-bye to the people of Moresheth-gath, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for they must soon go away.</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you prefer not to refer to the pun in a footnote, you may translate without a figure of speech (as in the two preceding examples), but supply a footnote that explains the reason the people will have to leave. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Micah told the people of Judah to say good-bye to the people of Moresheth-gath, because an enemy army would capture that city and take the people away as captives.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>send:</strong> It is not clear to whom this command is given. Here are the main interpretations:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is given to <u>the people in Judah</u>.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>people of Judah, say good-bye to the town of Moresheth Gath (GNT) <em>(GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is given to <u>the people in Lachish</u> (see 1:13a–c).</p></li><li><p>It is given to <u>the people in Jerusalem</u> (“daughter of Zion,” see 1:13b).</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most commentaries.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Commentaries that support interpretation (1) include NAC, JFB, and TOTC. According to JFB (page 689), “‘Israel’ in this verse is used for the kingdom of <em>Judah</em>, which was the chief representative of the whole nation of Israel.” Interpretation (2) is supported by a footnote in the NET: “The subject of the feminine singular verb is probably Lachish.” Interpretation (3) is supported by A&amp;F (page 232), who say only: “In the absence of a clear candidate to be subject of the verb, Jerusalem is the probable giver.” A fourth interpretation is suggested by Waltke 2007. On pages 81–82, he says: “the parallel in v 14b shows that the rulers of Israel are the subjects.”</span></span> The GNT explicitly follows this interpretation. Other versions leave the reference implicit (ambiguous). For many readers, an ambiguous command will incorrectly refer back to Israel or Lachish. So it is recommended that you translate in a way that refers clearly to Judah.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In Hebrew, this command is singular. Micah used Hebrew poetry here, so he spoke to the nation as if it were one person. You may use either singular or plural, depending on whether you refer here to the nation or the people of the nation.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Moresheth-gath:</strong> In 1:1a, Micah called the name of his home town Moresheth, but here he called it Moresheth-gath.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There was probably more than one town named Moresheth, so by adding the extra name “Gath” Micah made it clear which town he meant. Some scholars think that this town was called Moresheth-gath because it was near the Philistine city of Gath.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions spell the name of this town differently. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Moresheth Gath (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Moreshethgath (KJV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Moresheth in Gath (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You may want to use a spelling that fits the phonetic rules of your language or a spelling that is used in a language of wider communication in your country.</p><h4>1:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the houses of Achzib will prove deceptive to the kings of Israel.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The kings of Israel will get no help from the people in Achzib.</p></li><li><p>The kings of Israel will be disappointed. The town of Achzib will not help them.</p></li><li><p>The kings of Israel hope that the people of Achzib will be their ally, but they will be disappointed.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the houses of Achzib will prove deceptive to the kings of Israel:</strong> Micah used a pun in this sentence. The name <em>Achzib</em> sounds like the Hebrew word for <em>deceptive</em> (<em>achzab</em>).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In Hebrew, the name Achzib is (<em>ʾakzib</em>). The word for “deceptive” is (<em>ʾakzab</em>). Instead of “deceptive,” two versions follow another possible meaning. The NET has: “as disappointing as a dried up well.” The NJPS has “like a spring that fails.” NAC (pages 59–60) has the following comment: “In Jer 15:18 ‘deceptive’ is used of a brook that has dried up. Achzib will be as undependable and disappointing as a dried-up brook because its people won’t be able to give any help to the kings of Israel.” A footnote in the NET has: The term אַכְזָב (<em>ʾakzab</em>) is often translated “deception,” as derived from the verb I כָּזָב (“to deceive, lie”; HALOT 467–68 s.v. I כזב). However, it probably means “what is dried up,” since (1) the noun elsewhere refers to an empty well or dried river in summer (Jer 15:18; cf. Job 6:15–20) (<em>HALOT</em> 45 s.v. אַכְזָב); (2) the place-name “Achzib” (אַכְזִיב) literally means “place on the אַכְזָב [dried up river]” (<em>HALOT</em> 45 s.v. אַכְזָב); and (3) it is derived from the verb II כָּזָב (“to dry up [brook]”; Isa 58:11), which also appears in Mishnaic Hebrew and Arabic. The point of the metaphor is that Achzib will be as disappointing to the kings of Israel as a dried up spring in the summer is to a thirsty traveler in the Jordanian desert.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The kings of Israel hoped that the town of <em>Achzib</em> would be their ally. They hoped that the people in <em>Achzib</em> would send soldiers to help them fight the enemy. But the kings of Israel would soon feel <u>deceived</u> or <u>disappointed</u>, because <em>Achzib</em> would not send any help. Here are some other ways to translate this idea:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The kings of Israel will get no help from the town of Achzib. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Israel’s kings will discover that they cannot trust the town of Achzib. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The town of Achzib has deceived the kings of Israel, for it promised help it could not give. (NLT96)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The kings in Israel trusted the Achzib people to help them. But they will send no help.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the houses of Achzib:</strong> This phrase is a poetic way to refer to the town of Achzib or to the people who live there.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Hebrew text has plural “houses of” (Hebrew: <em>botteh</em>). The plural form is reflected in the BSB, ESV, KJV, NASB, NCV, NJPS, and NRSV. Singular “house of” would be <em>bet</em> in Hebrew. Versions that reflect the singular form include the CEV, GW, NAB, NIV, NJB, NLT, REB and GNT. The singular form may also assume that “house of” is part of the name of the town, such as the Bethlehem (meaning “house of bread”). The Notes have not treated this as a textual or interpretation issue, because the singular-plural distinction does not affect the number of towns and has only a slight effect on the meaning of the pun. Waltke 2007 (page 83) advances the idea that “houses” should be translated as “workshops” and that these workshops (factories) would no longer produce goods that could be sold. No versions translate this word as “workshops.” NAC (pages 59–60) gives persuasive reasons for rejecting Waltke’s idea. It says: “Elsewhere when <em>ḇayiṯ</em>, ‘house,’ is used in the sense of “workshop,” the nature of the work is specified. In 1 Chr 4:21 it is linen work; in Jer 18:2 it is the work of a potter. Here in Mic 1:14 no such work is specified. Furthermore, as Hillers points out, this passage speaks not of ‘loss’ but of ‘something that deceives or disappoints.’ So while ‘workshops’ is semantically possible, ‘town’ seems more likely.”</span></span> Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the town of Achzib (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the residents of Achzib (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Beth-Achzib (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>kings of Israel:</strong> This phrase may refer to kings of the northern kingdom in contrast to kings of the southern kingdom of Judah.

In 1:6–7, he predicted that the LORD would destroy <u>Samaria</u>. Here in 1:8–16, he predicted that the LORD would also punish the people in Judah, including <u>Jerusalem</u>. He would punish them by causing an enemy army to invade Judah.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section has two paragraphs: 1:8–9 and 1:10–16. In the first paragraph, Micah said that he would “lament and wail” (BSB). He described the way that he would mourn and then gave the reason. In the second paragraph, he mentioned several cities in Judah that an enemy army would soon attack on its way to Jerusalem. Some versions have separate section headings for each paragraph. The Notes will include both paragraphs as part of the same section. Here are some other examples of section headings for the entire section (1:8–16):</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Lament for Jerusalem and the lowland towns (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Judah Is Doomed (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Doom of the Cities of Judah (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Micah mourned the disaster that will happen to various cities in Judah</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">If you choose to use separate section headings for 1:8–9 and 1:10–16, here are some examples for 1:8–9:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Weeping and Mourning (NIV, BSB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Micah’s Great Sadness (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Either the CEV or NRSV headings above will be appropriate for 1:10–16.

These towns were located in the foothills between the low coastal area and the mountains of Judah.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>EBC (page 508). According to A&amp;F (page 212), some of the cities mentioned have not been identified, and it is not possible to guess the route of the attack or the identity of the invaders. It could have been any of several different kings.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">In many English versions as well as TN, 1:10–16 forms one paragraph. Some versions divide it into two or three paragraphs. For example, the GNT has two paragraphs (10–14 and 15–16). The NLT has three paragraphs (10–12, 13–15, and 16). Use whatever paragraph structure is appropriate for your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some of the poetic variations of Micah’s lament in 1:10–16:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>In some verses, he spoke <u>to</u> the people in a particular town. In other verses, he spoke <u>about</u> them.</p></li><li><p>Sometimes he used <u>plural</u> nouns or pronouns to refer to the people in a particular town. At other times, he used <u>singular</u> nouns or pronouns.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">English versions consistently use either plural or singular forms throughout these verses. For example, in 1:11b, the NJB uses singular pronouns:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>She</u> has not left her city, <u>she</u> who lives in Zanaan. (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The NIV uses a plural pronoun:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Those who live in Zaanan will not come out. (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">You may use either singular or plural forms or a combination of the two, depending on what is natural and appropriate in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In 1:10–16, Micah used past tense verbs to describe what was still in the future. See the notes on 1:9b and 1:9c for more details.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Micah also made puns with the names of several of the towns or cities. A pun is a figure of speech in which a person uses a word that has two meanings or a word that sounds like another word.</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>In some verses, he used a word that <u>sounded like the name</u> of that town.</p></li><li><p>In other verses, he said something about a town that was <u>related to the meaning of its name</u>.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">Here is a brief summary of the puns in each verse<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This summary is condensed and adapted from EBC (pages 407–8.)</span></span> and some general advice on how to translate puns. Complete notes on each verse will start with 1:10a.</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p><em>Beth-leaphrah</em> (1:10b): The name of this city sounds like the Hebrew words that mean “house of dust.” Micah commanded those who live in that town to roll in the <u>dust</u>.</p></li><li><p><em>Shaphir</em> (1:11a): This name means “beautiful” or “pleasant” in Hebrew. Micah said that the lives of the people in that town will not be <u>pleasant</u>.</p></li><li><p><em>Zaanan</em> (1:11b): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “come out.” Micah said that the people there will not <u>come out</u> of their city.</p></li><li><p><em>Beth-ezel</em> (1:11c): This name probably means “nearby house” in Hebrew. Micah said that Beth-ezel would no longer be nearby to serve as a “standing place” (protection, refuge) for Jerusalem.</p></li><li><p><em>Maroth</em> (1:12a): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “bitter.” Micah said that the people in that town will suffer <u>bitterly</u>.</p></li><li><p><em>Lachish</em> (1:13): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “team of <u>horses</u>.” Micah told the people in that town to flee like running <u>horses</u>.</p></li><li><p><em>Moresheth (-gath)</em> (1:14a): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “betrothed” (engaged to be married). Just like a young woman <u>departs</u> from her family when she gets married, so the people in that town would soon <u>depart</u> from Judah.</p></li><li><p><em>Achzib</em> (1:14b): This name means “deception” in Hebrew. That town will be a <u>deception</u> to the kings of Israel. These kings had hoped in vain that the people of Achzib would help them fight the enemy.</p></li><li><p><em>Mareshah</em> (1:15a): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “conqueror.” The LORD will bring an enemy to that town who will <u>conquer</u> them.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">In addition to the above puns, Micah also included the names of two places (Gath 1:10a) and Adullam (1:15b) that are famous in Jewish history. Their significance will be discussed in the notes on those verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The people to whom Micah spoke over 2,700 years ago understood the puns. They also understood the historical significance of Gath and Adullam. But most people today do not understand these things. That is the reason it is difficult to translate these verses clearly. Here are some general options to consider in translating the puns:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><u>Ignore the puns</u>. Most English versions do this in the actual translation. Just translate the name in the Hebrew text. Those who read your translation will understand the basic meaning of each verse, but they will not know that there was a pun in Hebrew.</p></li><li><p><u>Use footnotes to explain the puns</u>. Many English versions with footnotes do this. For example, the NIV uses footnotes at 1:10a, 11b, 12a, 13a, and 15a to explain that a name sounds like another Hebrew word. It uses other footnotes at 1:10b, 11a, and 14b to explain the meaning of the name of a town.</p></li><li><p><u>Explain in your translation</u> the meaning or the sound of the names for the cities. If you use this option, you will need to clearly indicate in some way that this information is not part of your translation.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Choose an option that is appropriate for the readers in your language area.</p></div><h4>1:15a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:15a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I will again bring a conqueror against you, O dweller of Mareshah.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I will send someone to conquer you<sup>(plur)</sup> also, people who live in Mareshah.</p></li><li><p>And <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yahweh says,</span> “As for you people who live in Mareshah, I will send someone who will conquer you as well.”</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yahweh said that</span> he will cause/send enemies to fight against your town to defeat you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In this verse part, Micah talked about Mareshah, another town in Judah. The LORD will send an enemy to conquer that city also.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will again bring a conqueror against you:</strong> In Hebrew, there are three ways to interpret the word <em>again</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “furthermore” or “also.” In 1:10–14, Micah said that an enemy army would attack several Jewish cities. Here in 1:15a, the LORD said that <u>in addition to</u> those other cities, he would <u>also</u> send an enemy army to conquer Mareshah. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>People of Mareshah: I will send someone to conquer you <u>also</u>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>And</u> you <u>too</u>, people of Mareshah, I shall send others to take your place… (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And <u>besides that</u>, I will send an army to conquer you <u>too</u>, people of Mareshah! <em>(NASB, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Some scholars think this word means “again,” or “one more time.” God will send a conqueror to Mareshah <u>again</u>. This implies that this is not the first time that God had sent a conqueror to Mareshah.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will <u>again</u> bring a conqueror to you, inhabitants of Mareshah. (ESV) <em>(BSB, ESV, GW, NJB, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Some scholars think that this word mean “yet” or “still.” God had not yet sent an army to conquer them, but he would <u>still</u> do it. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Yet must I bring to you the conqueror (NAB) <em>(KJV, NAB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most commentaries.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Most scholars do not mention this issue. No commentary supports the translation “again.” UBS (pages 149–150) says that if “again,” is correct, it would have to refer to a previous incident in which an enemy conquered Mareshah. “If ‘again’ does not mean ‘a second time’ in this verse, it may well be omitted in other languages, since the other alternatives are simply connecting words which do not add anything new to the sense.” Waltke 2007 (83–84) comments: “<em>ʿōḏ</em> (<em>Also</em>) can mean “beside,” or “again” (NRSV). The latter, however, diffuses the threat by raising the question, “When previously did God bring a conqueror against Mareshah?” “Besides” fits the context well.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Many English versions (the NIV and GNT are two examples) leave this word untranslated. If the recommended interpretation is clear in your language, you may do the same thing.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I:</strong> This pronoun refers to the LORD. Micah spoke the LORD’s words here, like he did in 1:6.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In all of the rest of 1:10–16 <u>Micah</u> is the speaker. Only here at 1:15a is the LORD the speaker. A literal translation of 1:15a may confuse your readers. They may think that <em>I</em> refers to Micah. There are several ways you can translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate the pronoun <em>I</em> <u>literally</u>. Your readers may need to study and think about the verse to understand that the LORD is the speaker, not Micah. Many English versions do this.</p></li><li><p>Translate the pronoun as <em>I</em> and also add a <u>footnote</u> to indicate who the speaker is. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>1:15a:</u> The Lord is the one who is speaking here.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the pronoun as <em>I</em> and also <u>include a phrase</u> such as “The LORD says,” or “This is what the LORD says” at the beginning or end of the sentence, wherever it is natural in your language. For example,</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The LORD says, “You people of Mareshah, I will send enemies to conquer your town also…”</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate 1:15a as an <u>indirect quote</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The LORD says that he will send a conqueror against you people in Mareshah.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate 1:15a as <u>Micah’s words</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>People of Mareshah, the Lord will hand you over to an enemy, who is going to capture your town. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>People of Mareshah, the Lord will send someone to capture your town. (CEV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Choose an option that is clear, natural, and appropriate in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>bring a conqueror against you:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the word <em>conqueror</em> here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to an enemy army that will fight against Mareshah and conquer it. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>an enemy, who is going to capture your town (GNT) <em>(BSB, CEV, ESV, GW, NAB, NCV, NET, NIV, NJB, NLT, NRSV, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to an enemy army that will take possession of Mareshah like an heir takes possession of an inheritance.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In addition to the NASB, the NJPS has “a dispossessor” and the REB has “others to take your place.” The KJV has “an heir.”</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the one who takes possession (NASB) <em>(KJV, NASB, NJPS, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most commentaries prefer interpretation (2).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>UBS prefers interpretation (1), but comments (pages 149–150) that a translation such as “others to take your place” (NEB) “can be related to the idea of a conqueror if it means that the conquering people will take the people of Mareshah away into exile and brings others to live in their town.” Commentaries that support interpretation (2) include NICOT, WBC, A&amp;F, EBC, JFB, TOTC, and NAC. WBC (page 19–20) says that the word can mean “possessor,” “heir,” or “conqueror.” Waltke 2007 and TOTC both translate “conqueror,” but TOTC (pages 170–171) comments: “Possibly by popular etymologizing, <em>Mareshah</em> was associated with the verb ‘dispossess’. A new heir will dispossess the old heritage of Judah.” NICOT (page 282) relates the name to <em>yōrēš</em>, “possessor, heir.” He comments: “Mareshah is to be taken over by a new heir. It is not insignificant that the word is often used of gains in war: the right of inheritance is to be won by conquest.”</span></span> But it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions. It is not known whether enemy soldiers or people from other countries dispossessed the people of the town. A more general translation such as <em>conqueror</em> allows for both interpretations.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>conqueror:</strong> This word is singular. It probably refers to an enemy army.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>It is possible that the singular conqueror refers to the king of the Assyrian enemies. The king sent his soldiers to attack the cities in Judah.</span></span> If it is clearer in your language, you can translate this word as plural. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>I will bring against you <u>people who will take your land</u>, you who live in Mareshah. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>you:</strong> In Hebrew, this pronoun is singular. It refers by personification to the town of Mareshah. In some languages, it may be clearer to use a plural pronoun here. Translate this pronoun in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>O dweller of Mareshah:</strong> If it is more natural in your language, you can translate it as plural, as in the NRSV (“inhabitants of Mareshah”).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In Hebrew, the phrase <em>dweller of Mareshah</em> is at the <u>end</u> of 1:15b. In some languages, it may be better to have this phrase at the <u>beginning</u> of the sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>O people of Mareshah, I will bring a conqueror to capture your town. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Do whatever is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Mareshah:</strong> <em>Mareshah</em> was a town in Judah. It was about seven kilometers southwest of Achzib and five kilometers south of Moresheth.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Micah used a pun here. The Hebrew word for “conqueror” (<em>yoresh</em>) has a similar sound to the name <em>Mareshah</em>. If you use footnotes in your translation, here are some suggested footnotes:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The place name <em>Mareshah</em> sounds like the Hebrew word for “conqueror.” (NET footnote)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>[Mareshah] This name sounds like the Hebrew word for a person who captures other cities and lands. (NCV footnote)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you do not use footnotes and you feel it is important for your readers to understand that this is a pun, here is a way to translate this verse part so that the pun is explicit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You people in Mareshah! <span data-bnType=\"implied\">The name of your town sounds like the word “conqueror.” So</span> to you the LORD says, “I will send enemies to conquer your town also!”</p></blockquote><h4>1:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The glory of Israel will come to Adullam.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The leaders of Israel will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">flee</span> to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the town of</span> Adullam.</p></li><li><p>The important people of Israel will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">run away and hide</span> at Adullam.</p></li><li><p>The leaders of Israel will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">hide from their enemies</span>, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like David did long ago in the cave</span> at Adullam.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The glory of Israel will come to Adullam:</strong> During the time of Micah, Adullam was an important fortified town. It was part of Rehoboam’s defense system along with Lachish (2 Chr. 11:6–10) and was located not far from Achzib between Lachish and Moresheth-gath.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>UBS, NAC, NICOT.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Micah is probably the speaker here. Even if the speaker is the LORD instead of Micah, it does not affect the meaning. There are two ways to interpret the meaning of the phrase <em>The glory of Israel</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to the <u>leaders</u> of the nation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The leaders of Israel (GNT) <em>(NET, NLT, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to a single <u>king</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Israel’s glorious king (CEV) <em>(CEV, NIV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with a majority of versions and commentaries.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Commentaries that support interpretation (1) include UBS, JFB, NAC, ABC, and Waltke 2007. NAC (pages 60–61) uses the phrase “Israel’s glorious leaders,” and Waltke 2007 (page 85) refers to “Israel’s military leaders and officials.” WBC (page 22) refers to a combination of things and people. He has” “wealth and nobles.” EBC (page 509) has simply “the people.” The NIV translation “He who is the glory of Israel” could refer to the king of Judah, or it could even refer to the Messiah.</span></span> The Hebrew word for <em>glory</em> is also used to mean leaders in Isaiah 5:13; 17:3–4.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>glory:</strong> Micah called these leaders Israel’s <em>glory</em> because they were important people. The other people in the nation were proud of them. Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Israel’s respected/famous leaders</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>will come to Adullam:</strong> The historical context of this phase is that over 200 years earlier, when King Saul and his army were searching for David to kill him, David and his men hid in a cave near the town of Adullam (1 Samuel 22:1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here in Micah 1:15b, <em>Adullam</em> is a symbol for running away and hiding from danger. Micah’s words mean that Israel’s leaders will be in danger. They will run away and hide, just like David had done long ago.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways that you can translate the phrase <em>will come to Adullam</em>:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate the verb <em>will come</em> <u>literally</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the leaders of Israel shall flee to Adullam (NET)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">If you do this, you may want to add a <u>footnote</u> to explain the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Adullam is the place where David hid in a cave when he was in danger. See 1 Samuel 22:1. Micah’s words in 1:15b indicate that Israel’s leaders will hide from danger just like David did.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>…This probably means that the nation’s leadership will run for their lives and, like David of old, hide from their enemy in the caves of Adullam… (NET footnote)</p></blockquote><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate the verb <em>will come</em> in a way that will help your readers understand the symbolic meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The leaders of Israel will <u>go and hide</u> in the cave at Adullam. (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate the name <em>Adullam</em>:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the town of Adullam</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the cave at Adullam (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Adullam Cave (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"></p>",

These towns were located in the foothills between the low coastal area and the mountains of Judah.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>EBC (page 508). According to A&amp;F (page 212), some of the cities mentioned have not been identified, and it is not possible to guess the route of the attack or the identity of the invaders. It could have been any of several different kings.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">In many English versions as well as TN, 1:10–16 forms one paragraph. Some versions divide it into two or three paragraphs. For example, the GNT has two paragraphs (10–14 and 15–16). The NLT has three paragraphs (10–12, 13–15, and 16). Use whatever paragraph structure is appropriate for your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some of the poetic variations of Micah’s lament in 1:10–16:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>In some verses, he spoke <u>to</u> the people in a particular town. In other verses, he spoke <u>about</u> them.</p></li><li><p>Sometimes he used <u>plural</u> nouns or pronouns to refer to the people in a particular town. At other times, he used <u>singular</u> nouns or pronouns.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">English versions consistently use either plural or singular forms throughout these verses. For example, in 1:11b, the NJB uses singular pronouns:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>She</u> has not left her city, <u>she</u> who lives in Zanaan. (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The NIV uses a plural pronoun:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Those who live in Zaanan will not come out. (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">You may use either singular or plural forms or a combination of the two, depending on what is natural and appropriate in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In 1:10–16, Micah used past tense verbs to describe what was still in the future. See the notes on 1:9b and 1:9c for more details.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Micah also made puns with the names of several of the towns or cities. A pun is a figure of speech in which a person uses a word that has two meanings or a word that sounds like another word.</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>In some verses, he used a word that <u>sounded like the name</u> of that town.</p></li><li><p>In other verses, he said something about a town that was <u>related to the meaning of its name</u>.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">Here is a brief summary of the puns in each verse<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This summary is condensed and adapted from EBC (pages 407–8.)</span></span> and some general advice on how to translate puns. Complete notes on each verse will start with 1:10a.</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p><em>Beth-leaphrah</em> (1:10b): The name of this city sounds like the Hebrew words that mean “house of dust.” Micah commanded those who live in that town to roll in the <u>dust</u>.</p></li><li><p><em>Shaphir</em> (1:11a): This name means “beautiful” or “pleasant” in Hebrew. Micah said that the lives of the people in that town will not be <u>pleasant</u>.</p></li><li><p><em>Zaanan</em> (1:11b): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “come out.” Micah said that the people there will not <u>come out</u> of their city.</p></li><li><p><em>Beth-ezel</em> (1:11c): This name probably means “nearby house” in Hebrew. Micah said that Beth-ezel would no longer be nearby to serve as a “standing place” (protection, refuge) for Jerusalem.</p></li><li><p><em>Maroth</em> (1:12a): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “bitter.” Micah said that the people in that town will suffer <u>bitterly</u>.</p></li><li><p><em>Lachish</em> (1:13): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “team of <u>horses</u>.” Micah told the people in that town to flee like running <u>horses</u>.</p></li><li><p><em>Moresheth (-gath)</em> (1:14a): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “betrothed” (engaged to be married). Just like a young woman <u>departs</u> from her family when she gets married, so the people in that town would soon <u>depart</u> from Judah.</p></li><li><p><em>Achzib</em> (1:14b): This name means “deception” in Hebrew. That town will be a <u>deception</u> to the kings of Israel. These kings had hoped in vain that the people of Achzib would help them fight the enemy.</p></li><li><p><em>Mareshah</em> (1:15a): This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “conqueror.” The LORD will bring an enemy to that town who will <u>conquer</u> them.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">In addition to the above puns, Micah also included the names of two places (Gath 1:10a) and Adullam (1:15b) that are famous in Jewish history. Their significance will be discussed in the notes on those verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The people to whom Micah spoke over 2,700 years ago understood the puns. They also understood the historical significance of Gath and Adullam. But most people today do not understand these things. That is the reason it is difficult to translate these verses clearly. Here are some general options to consider in translating the puns:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><u>Ignore the puns</u>. Most English versions do this in the actual translation. Just translate the name in the Hebrew text. Those who read your translation will understand the basic meaning of each verse, but they will not know that there was a pun in Hebrew.</p></li><li><p><u>Use footnotes to explain the puns</u>. Many English versions with footnotes do this. For example, the NIV uses footnotes at 1:10a, 11b, 12a, 13a, and 15a to explain that a name sounds like another Hebrew word. It uses other footnotes at 1:10b, 11a, and 14b to explain the meaning of the name of a town.</p></li><li><p><u>Explain in your translation</u> the meaning or the sound of the names for the cities. If you use this option, you will need to clearly indicate in some way that this information is not part of your translation.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Choose an option that is appropriate for the readers in your language area.</p></div><h4>1:16</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In this verse, Micah addressed the <u>people of Judah</u>. The GNT makes this explicit by starting the verse with the words “People of Judah…”</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse has two pairs of parallel lines that are similar in meaning. The <u>first</u> line is parallel to the <u>third</u> line. The <strong>second</strong> line is parallel to the <strong>fourth</strong> line:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>16a</sup> <u>Shave yourselves bald</u> and <u>cut off your hair</u></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>16b</sup> <strong>in mourning for your precious children</strong>,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>16c</sup> <u>make yourselves as bald as an eagle</u>,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>16d</sup> <strong>for they will go from you into exile</strong>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, this kind of parallelism may cause confusion. If that is true in your language, it may be possible to combine the similar verse parts. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>16a,c</sup>People of Judah, shave your head as bald as a buzzard and start mourning. <sup>16b,d</sup>Your children whom you love will be dragged off to a foreign country. (similar to CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>1:16a-c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Shave yourselves bald and cut off your hair in mourning…make yourselves as bald as an eagle:</strong> Here Micah talked about a <u>symbolic action</u>. One way that the Jews mourned when they were very sad was to cut off some of the hair on their heads.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Other verses that talk about this symbolic action are Job 1:20; Isaiah 15:2; 22:12; Jeremiah 7:29; 16:6; and Amos 8:10.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The BSB and many other English versions make explicit the meaning of the action by using the words “in mourning” or “ in sorrow” or something similar, usually in 1:16a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>“Shave your heads <u>in mourning</u>” (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>shave your heads <u>in sorrow</u> (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>cut off your hair to show you are sad (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>1:16a–b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:16a–b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(combined/reordered)</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You people of Judah!</span> Mourn for all the people in your cities whom you love. Cut off your hair to show how sad you are.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Shave yourselves bald and cut off your hair in mourning for your precious children:</strong> Micah ordered the people to mourn for their beloved children by cutting off the hair on their own heads and making themselves bald. These two actions are not in chronological order. <u>The first phrase</u>, <em>Shave yourselves bald</em>, is the <u>result</u> of cutting off the hair.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If it is clearer in your language, you may <u>reverse the order</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Cut off your hair to make yourselves bald!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You may also translate <em>Shave yourselves bald</em> and <em>cut off your hair</em> as <u>one action</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>People of Judah, <u>cut off your hair in mourning</u> for the children you love. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>Shave your heads bald as you mourn</u> for the children you love (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a natural option for your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for:</strong> In Hebrew, the word <em>for</em> in 1:16b indicates <u>purpose</u>. The <u>purpose</u> for mourning is to show their sorrow because of what will happen to their children. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>in order to mourn</u> for the children whom you love</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>to show your sorrow</u> about the children whom you love</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your precious children:</strong> This phrase is a <u>figure of speech</u>. It refers to the people in the cities that Micah mentioned in 1:10–15. In 1:16, Micah talked to the people Judah as if the entire nation were a <u>mother</u><span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In Hebrew the commands in 1:16a–b are feminine singular, as if Micah was talking to a woman. Most scholars agree that Micah was talking to the nation of Judah, or perhaps to the rulers of Judah in Jerusalem.</span></span> and its cities were like the mother’s <u>children</u>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate this figure of speech (personification) in your language:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate this figure of speech <u>literally</u>. The GNT and NET (quoted above under 1:16a) are two examples.</p></li><li><p>Translate this figure of speech <u>literally</u>. Add a <u>footnote</u> to explain the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your precious children (CEV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">The CEV also has the following footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><strong>1:16 precious children</strong>: The towns mentioned in verses 10–15.</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:16a–b</strong></h5><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Translate this figure of speech as a <u>simile</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You people of Judah! Cut off your hair until you are bald! Do this to mourn for <u>your fellow-citizens, whom you love like a mother loves her own children</u>.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning directly without using a <u>figure of speech</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">People of Judah,</span> cut off your hair to mourn for all the people in those cities of yours.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to combine and/or reorder the information in 1:16a–b. See 1:16a–b (combined/reordered) in the Display for an example.</p></div><h4>1:16a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:16a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Shave yourselves bald and cut off your hair</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Cut off<sup>(plur)</sup> your hair and thus make yourselves bald!

Cut off your hair until you are totally bald <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to show how sad you are</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>make yourselves as bald as an eagle:</strong> In 1:16a, Micah told the people to make themselves bald. Here in 1:16c, he added emphasis by using a simile that compares their baldness to a bird that has few or no feathers on its head. In Hebrew, there are two main ways to interpret the word that the BSB translates as <em>eagle</em>:<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to a footnote in the NET, “The Hebrew term נֶשֶׁר (<em>nešer</em>) refers to the griffon vulture or eagle.” A&amp;F also say that the Hebrew word is a general term for eagles or vultures.</span></span></p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to a vulture or buzzard. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>make yourselves as bald as the vulture (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…as bald as a buzzard (CEV) <em>(CEV, GW, NABRE, NIV, NJB, NLT, REB, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to an eagle. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Let your baldness be as the eagle’s (NAB) <em>(BSB, ESV, KJV, NAB, NASB, NCV, NET, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1),<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Commentaries that favor interpretation (1) include: UBS, KD, ZIBBC, NICOT, NAC, and Waltke. JFB, however, comments that all eagles are comparatively bald in molting season. Pusey (page 27) comments that in terms of actual baldness, the vulture is a better choice, but in favor of the eagle, he quotes Bochart as saying, “The moulting of the eagle involves some degree of weakness, with which he compares Judah’s mournful and weak condition amid the loss of their children, gone into captivity.”</span></span> unless “eagle” better conveys Micah’s emphasis in your language area. Vultures are known in most parts of the world as bald-headed birds that eat dead animals.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>as bald as an eagle:</strong> This simile means “very bald” or “completely bald.” Here are some ways to translate this figure of speech (following interpretation (1)):</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a simile that is similar to one used in the NIV or CEV (quoted above).</p></li><li><p><u>Substitute the name of a bird</u> in your country that is well-known for its bare head. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as bald as a <em>wanaa</em>-bird’s head</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the <u>meaning without a figure of speech</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Make yourselves completely bald.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a natural option for your language that is acceptable and clear.</p><h4>1:16d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:16d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for they will go from you into exile.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because all those people will go away from you<sup>(plur)</sup> and live as slaves in a foreign land.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You will be sad</span> because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">your enemies</span> will take away all those people from your <span data-bnType=\"implied\">land</span> and make them live as slaves in another land.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for:</strong> In Hebrew, the word <em>for</em> in 1:16d introduces the reason for 1:16c.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>UBS (pages 150–152).</span></span> The reason is that the people will go into exile.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they:</strong> The pronoun <em>they</em> refers to “your precious children” in 1:16a. That phrase is a figure of speech for the people in the cities Micah had talked about in 1:10–15. (See the Note on 1:16b above.)</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will go from you into exile:</strong> Some English versions translate this verb phrase as if the action has already occurred. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>they have gone away</u> from you into exile (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Most scholars think that Micah used the past tense here to emphasize that this event <u>will certainly happen</u>. See the note and endnote at 1:9b.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>UBS (pages 150–152) and NAC (pages 61–62) both document in detail the historical events that indicate that Micah was using the prophetic perfect tense to refer to future events. WBC (pages 22–23) agrees, but he makes the following comment: “Those who read it as complete in the past regard this verse as a post-exilic addition to the work of Micah.” A&amp;F give other reasons to support a historical exile in the past: “All references to “exile” do not have to be attached to the Babylonian Exile of the sixth century, just because it has been given so much space in the Hebrew Bible. If 2 Chronicles 28 provides the background for Micah 1 we are at a moment where captives have been taken, but not yet returned.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this verb phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because <u>your children will be taken</u> away to a foreign land (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for <u>they are taken</u> from you into exile (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>from you:</strong> Many of the people in Judah will be taken away <em>from</em> their cities, neighbors, and relatives, but most of them will remain. The pronoun <em>you</em> here refers to those who remain.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>into exile:</strong> This means that the enemy army will capture their cities, take some of the people as prisoners, and force them to move to a different country.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:16a–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Micah’s main point in this verse is that an enemy army will force many people in Judah to go live in another country (1:16b, d). In some languages, it may be clearer to reorder the verse parts so that the main point occurs first. See 1:16a–b (combined/reordered in the Display for an example.</p></div>",

Here it is an exclamation to show sadness. The Jews used this word when they mourned someone who had just died (for example, 1 Kings 13:30; Jeremiah 22:18). Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>How terrible it will be… (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>How horrible it will be… (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What sorrow awaits you… (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Those people are as good as dead… (see NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You may also use a word or expression in your language that people say when they are very sad because someone has died or has been in a terrible accident.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Micah said <em>Woe</em> to these people because he knew that God would punish them. Here is a translation that emphasizes this aspect of meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God will certainly punish those people who…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to those who devise iniquity and plot evil:</strong> The meaning of this phrase is that the people plan to do evil things. The BSB uses two nouns <em>iniquity</em> and <em>evil</em> as objects of the verbs <em>devise</em> and <em>plot</em>. Some versions use two nouns as objects of one verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for those who <u>devise</u> <u>wickedness and evil deeds</u> (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural to translate these two phrases as one phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>…those who…<u>plan evil</u> (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who lie in bed, <u>making evil plans</u> (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>on their beds:</strong> The phrase <em>on their beds</em> describes the location of those people when they “devise iniquity and plot evil.” It implies that this occurs at night.

He said that he would punish them.</p></div><h4>2:2a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2a</sup>They covet <u>fields</u> and <strong>seize them</strong>;</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2b</sup> <strong>they take away</strong> <u>houses</u>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Some English versions translate 2:2b so that it contains an ellipsis (a deliberately omitted phrase). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>houses, and take them away (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">If you follow this interpretation, it may be necessary to supply the missing verb from 2:2a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2b</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they covet</span> houses and take them away</p></blockquote><h4>2:2a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>They covet fields and seize them;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They desire to own fields <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that belong to other people</span>. So they take those fields away <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from them</span>.</p></li><li><p>Those people want to have land for farming. So they <span data-bnType=\"implied\">dishonestly/wrongfully</span> take possession of that land.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:1, Micah spoke about people who planned to do evil and then did it. Here in 2:2, he gave <u>specific examples</u> of the wicked things they did.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The people Micah talked about here coveted fields or houses that belonged to other people. They deceived, cheated, or even harmed those people in order to get their fields or houses.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A good example of this is found in 1 Kings 21:1–16. King Ahab strongly desired a field that belonged to another man. The king’s wife gave orders to have that man killed.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, emotions like coveting are naturally expressed with direct quotes. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They see fields or houses and they say in their hearts, “I want that!” Those things belong to other people. But they do evil to those people to get those things for themselves.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>They covet fields and seize them:</strong> This is the first example that Micah gave of the evil deeds of these people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>covet:</strong> The word <em>covet</em> means “to strongly desire to own something.” It is the same word that is used in the last of the Ten Commandments: “You shall not <u>covet</u> your neighbor’s house…” (Exodus 20:17). Here are some other ways to translate this verb:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>desire (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>want (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>fields:</strong> The word <em>fields</em> refers to farmland, areas of land on which farmers plant crops. (The same Hebrew word is translated as “the open field” in 1:6a.)</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is implied that these fields <u>belong to other people</u>. In some languages, it may be good to make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They desire <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other people’s</span> fields… (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and:</strong> This conjunction is used here to mean “and then” or “and so.” Some versions translate this as a <u>time</u> relationship. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They covet fields, <u>and then</u> seize them… (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>When</u> they want fields, they seize them… (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions translate this as a <u>result</u> relationship. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They desire <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other people’s</span> fields, <u>so</u> they seize them. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In this context, a time and result relationship are very close in meaning. First these people desire to get a field, <u>and then, as a result</u>, they take the field. Translate this relationship in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>seize:</strong> The verb <em>seize</em> often means “to grab something with one’s hands.” But here it means “to <u>forcibly become the owner</u> of something.” These people did evil to other people in order to become the owners of their fields. Here are some other ways to translate <em>seize</em>:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They covet fields and <u>take them by force</u>… (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They <u>confiscate</u> the fields they desire… (NET)</p></blockquote><h4>2:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>they take away houses.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They desire</span> houses <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that belong to others</span>. So they take those houses <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from them</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Or, they want to own</span> houses, so they do wicked things <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to the house owners</span> so that the houses become theirs.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they take away houses:</strong> Another thing these people desired and took was houses.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions make the verb “covet” from 2:2a explicit in this verse part as well. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>2a</sup>When they want fields, they seize them; <sup>2b</sup><u>when they want</u> houses, they take them. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>2a</sup>They desire <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other people’s</span> fields, so they seize them. <sup>2b</sup><u>They desire</u> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people’s</span> houses, so they take them. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this verb in a way that fits the grammatical patterns of your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>take away:</strong> This phrase means the same thing as “seize” in 2:2a. It means “become the owner of the houses.” It does not mean to remove the houses. Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they <u>take over</u> houses as well (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>houses…<u>take</u> them (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions make explicit the means by which these people take possession of someone’s house. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When you want someone’s house, you take it <u>by fraud and violence</u>. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they <u>oppress</u> a man and his house (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they <u>cheat</u> people to get their houses (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You may want to make this explicit in your language if it will be helpful.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:2a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to combine and/or reorder the parallel parts in these two lines. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You grab any field or house that you want… (CEV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:2c–d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2c–d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(combined/reordered)</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They cause other people extreme hardship in order to take away their inherited houses and land.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2c</sup>They deprive <u>a man</u> <strong>of his home</strong>,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2d</sup> <u>a fellow man</u> <strong>of his inheritance</strong>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">These verse parts are very similar in meaning to 2:2a–b. There is also an ellipsis (a deliberately omitted word) in 2:2d of the verb “deprive” in 2:2c. This is similar to the ellipsis of the verb “covet” in 2:2b. See the note for 2:2a–b.</p><h4>2:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>They deprive a man of his home,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They treat people cruelly in order to take away their houses</p></li><li><p>Those people do bad things to others. They take away their houses</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>They deprive a man of his home:</strong> There is a textual issue with this verse part:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Masoretic Text has “and they oppress a man and his house.” This verse part leaves implicit whether the reference is to people who take the householder’s property only, or to people who take his life along with his property.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Forced enslavement or murder of a homeowner would be two possible ways a life might be “taken” along with property. However, we don’t know that these atrocities would always have accompanied such land seizures.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They oppress a man and his house (ESV) <em>(BSB, CEV, ESV, GW, KJV, NAB, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, NJPS, NLT, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The LXX has “and take as plunder a man and his house.” This verse part makes explicit that the reference is to people who take the householder as plunder along with his property. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>owner and house they seize alike (NJB) <em>(NJB, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1) along with most versions and commentaries. By leaving some aspects implicit, it best reflects the lack of scholarly consensus on the exact nature and details of these land seizures.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>ZIBBC (page 132) points out that “Several attempts have been made to determine the exact nature of the offending land seizure, from an economic reorganization that disenfranchised smaller landholders to some sort of military conquest. The text, however, is not specific on this point…”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>deprive:</strong> To <em>deprive</em> a person involves causing that person extreme hardship, often by illegal means such as cheating.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions make the means of oppression more explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They <u>cheat</u> people to get their houses (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They <u>defraud</u> people of their homes (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They <u>rob</u> a man and his house (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a man:</strong> In Jewish culture, it was usually men who owned houses, not women. Here are some other ways to translate <em>a man</em>:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They defraud <u>men</u> of their homes (NJPS)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They cheat an <u>owner</u> of his house (NAB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that the NJPS uses a gender-specific form: “men.” The NAB uses a generic word: “owner.” Use whatever is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>his home:</strong> In Hebrew, the phrase <em>his home</em> can mean either a building or a household/family. For that reason there are two main ways to interpret this word in this context:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to a literal house as in 2:2b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They defraud men of their homes (NJPS) <em>(NCV, NET, NIV, NJPS, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to “family.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Waltke 2007 (page 96) says: “the singular, <em>ḇayiṯ</em> <em>(house)</em>, in v 2B, in accord with its linkage with <em>geḇer</em>, refers to family.” This interpretation accords with standard Hebrew grammar, in which the object of the verb “oppress” is always a person. See also A&amp;F (pages 269–270) and UBS (pages 154–155).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They cheat a man and his family (GW) <em>(GW, GNT)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The GNT has “No one’s family or property is safe.” UBS states that the word “family” is a translation of “house.”</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Versions that translate the word in 2:2c as <em>home</em> or “house” are ambiguous. Some examples are the BSB, the ESV, the KJV, the NASB, and the NRSV.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with the majority of versions. The parallel of <em>home</em> to “inheritance” in 2:2d makes it likely that both words refer to property.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A difficulty is the grammatical mismatch noted in an earlier footnote, that the verb “oppress” requires a person as the object. A&amp;F (pages 269–270) offers the explanation that in Hebrew the language is elliptical here.</span></span></p><h4>2:2d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>a fellow man of his inheritance.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and other property that they inherited.</p></li><li><p>and/or other property.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a fellow man of his inheritance:</strong> There is an ellipsis (a deliberately omitted phrase) in 2:2d that is similar to the one in 2:2b. Here in 2:2d, the subject and verb are both implied from the previous verse part. In some languages, it may be necessary to supply the missing subject and verb from 2:2c. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They oppress</span> a man in order to get his inheritance.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a fellow man:</strong> In Hebrew, this word (lit. “man”) is a synonym of the word “householder” (lit. man) used in 2:2c. It can refer to any person, including a “man” (in contrast to a woman) or a “husband.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In Jewish culture, men (not women) were usually the ones who owned houses and property. But the main point here in 2:2c–d is that these people owned houses or other property. The main point is not that they were males. Here are some other ways to translate <em>man</em> in 2c and 2d:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>men</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>others</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use whatever is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>inheritance:</strong> An <em>inheritance</em> is anything that a person has received from his parents when they die, including land, houses, or money. Here is another way to translate 2:2c–d:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They defraud people of their homes, and deprive people of the land they have inherited. (NET)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:1–2</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:1–2, Micah spoke <u>about</u> evil people. Many translations use third-person pronouns in these verses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Woe to <u>those</u> who devise wickedness and work evil…<u>they</u> perform it…the power of <u>their</u> hand…<u>they</u> covet fields…<u>they</u> oppress a man… (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">But in 2:3–5, the LORD spoke <u>to</u> these people. All English versions in 2:3–5 use the second-person pronouns “you” and “your.” In some languages, it may be confusing to use third-person pronouns in 2:1–2, and second-person pronouns in 2:3–5 to refer to the same people. If this is true in your language, you may want to translate 2:1–2 using second-person pronouns. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1a</sup>What sorrow awaits <u>you</u> who lie awake at night,…. <sup>1b</sup><u>You</u> rise at dawn…. <sup>2a</sup>When <u>you</u> want a piece of land, <u>you</u> find a way to seize it. <sup>2b</sup>When <u>you</u> want someone’s house, <u>you</u> take it by fraud and violence…<u>You</u> cheat a man of his property… (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Use pronouns that are natural in your language to make the meaning clear.</p><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:2c–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to combine and/or reorder the parallel parts in these two lines. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you cheat families out of homes and land (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"></p></div>",

Here are some other ways to translate this word here:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>lo (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Look (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to translate this word with an expression that means “Listen!” or “Indeed.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Many English versions leave this word untranslated. If you leave it implied in your translation, be sure that the importance of the LORD’s words is clearly emphasized in some other way.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I am planning:</strong> The BSB translates this verb using <u>present tense</u>. The LORD was already planning what he would do. Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I <u>am devising</u> (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>against this nation a disaster:</strong> In Hebrew, the word <em>nation</em> is more literally “clan” or “extended kinship group.” Here it has the broader meaning “people” or <em>nation</em>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT (#2442b).</span></span> There are two ways to interpret the phrase <em>this nation</em> in this context:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to <u>the evil people</u> that Micah talked about in 2:1–2.

Such a phrase is appropriate for an evil nation.</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to <u>the nation of Israel</u>, that is, to all of the Jewish people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“Look, I am devising disaster for this nation!” (NET) <em>(BSB, NAB, NET, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions and commentaries.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Commentaries that support interpretation (1) include UBS, ABC, JFB, CBC, and WBC. Commentaries that support interpretation (2) include EBC and TOTC. Waltke 2007 has apparently contradictory comments. On page 97, he says: “In biblical theology the whole “family,” bound together by blood and history, suffers for the sins of individuals within it, especially its leaders.” But on page 98, he says: “his oracle of doom was addressed directly to the venal land barons, whose identity will be unmasked in the next oracle.”</span></span> Although the versions listed under (1) do not explicitly use the word “evil,” it is strongly implied by the entire context, preceding (2:1–2) as well as following (2:6–11), that the nation as a whole was evil. In addition, the versions listed under (2) do not explicitly mention the wickedness of the nation, but that wickedness is implied by the entire context.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions are ambiguous. They do not clearly follow either interpretation (1) or (2). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>this family (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>this people (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>this clan (NJPS)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you translate this phrase in a way that clearly indicates in the context that the people or nation as a whole are evil. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>“Listen, I have decided to bring a disaster on this <span data-bnType=\"implied\">wicked</span> nation. And none of you will be able to avoid it.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>“Indeed, I am planning to punish people like you.

There, it refers to <u>iniquity</u>.” Here in 2:3b, it refers to a <u>disaster</u> that the LORD will cause to happen. Here are other ways to translate <em>a disaster</em> in 2:3b:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>disaster (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>trouble (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>calamity (NASB)</p></blockquote><h4>2:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>from which you cannot free your necks.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It will be <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like a yoke that is fastened</span> to your<sup>(plur)</sup> necks, and none of you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">wicked people</span> will be able to remove it.</p></li><li><p>You will not be able to escape.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>from which you cannot free your necks:</strong> This is a metaphor in which most of the body parts have been left implied. It compares the “disaster” that the nation of Israel will experience to a yoke that cannot be removed from the necks of cows or oxen. It means that they will not be able to escape or avoid the disaster.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">When the Jews plowed their fields, they used cows or oxen to pull the plow. They fastened the yoke that was connected to the plow onto the necks of the cows. The cows were unable to get their necks out of the yokes. In the same way, these wicked people will not avoid the disaster that God will send.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate this metaphor:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am planning disaster for this nation, <u>a yoke</u> which you cannot remove from your necks (REB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Change the metaphor to a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“Look, I am devising disaster for this nation. <u>It will be like a yoke</u> from which you can’t free your neck. (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without using a figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“I am planning disaster against this people, from which <u>you cannot save yourselves</u>. (NIV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this metaphor in a clear and natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The metaphor means that the people will <u>not</u> be able avoid this disaster. You can also translate the metaphor using a positive expression. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>…you will certainly be included</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>…you will certainly suffer in this disaster</p></blockquote><h4>2:3d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:3d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Then you will not walk so proudly,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And then you<sup>(plur)</sup> will no longer walk around proudly,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">When it happens</span>, you will no longer walk with your head held high,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Then you will not walk so proudly:</strong> To <em>walk so proudly</em> means “to walk around in a manner that shows that one is proud and arrogant.” In Jewish culture, people who were haughty walked with their necks stretched out and heads held up straight.

Consider using an expression in your language that describes people who walk around looking proud.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>not walk:</strong> Previously, these people walked around haughtily, but later, when God punishes them, they will <u>no longer</u> walk that way. Some versions make a phrase like this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You will <u>no longer</u> walk proudly (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and then you will <u>not</u> walk so proudly <u>any more</u> (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>2:3d–e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:3d–e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(combined/reordered)</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Yes, I will cause a terrible disaster to happen to you, and as a result you will stop acting so proud.</p></li></ul></div><h4>2:3e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:3e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for it will be a time of calamity.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because the disaster I will send will be very bad.</p></li><li><p>because at that time you will suffer greatly.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for it will be a time of calamity:</strong> The word <em>for</em> introduces the reason why those people will no longer ”walk so proudly.” They will no longer be haughty, <u>because</u> the disaster that the LORD sends will be so terrible.

As in 2:4d, it refers to the people of Israel, so many versions translate it as “us.”</p><h4>2:4f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:4f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He has allotted our fields to traitors.’”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He gave/assigned our<sup>(incl)</sup> fields to those who took us captive.”</p></li><li><p>Yahweh has given our farm lands to our enemies who defeated us.”</p></li><li><p>He/Yahweh divided our land and homes among our enemies/conquerors.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He has allotted our fields to traitors:</strong> There is more than one way to interpret the group of people among whom the LORD <em>has allotted</em> the <em>fields</em> and other property:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to a group of Israel’s enemies that has conquered them and made them captives. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lord has taken our land away And given it to <u>those who took us captive</u>.” (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Yes, he has taken it away from me and divided our fields among <u>our enemies</u>!’ ” (NCV) <em>(GW, NAB, NCV, NET, NJB, NRSV, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to a group of traitors or renegades that have betrayed Israel. It is possible that they are traitors in a spiritual sense (ESV &amp; NASB have “apostate”) because they have turned away from the true God in order to worship idols. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He has given our fields to <u>those who betrayed us</u>. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>To the <u>apostate</u> He apportions our fields. (NASB) <em>(BSB, CEV, ESV, NASB, NIV, NJPS, NLT; REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most commentaries.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Commentaries that support interpretation (1) include Waltke 2007, TOTC, UBS, JFB, ABC, A&amp;F, and NAC. Commentaries that support interpretation (2) include NET note, WBC, NICOT, and EBC. Waltke 2007 (page 103) notes: <em>lǝšôḇeḇ</em> <em>(to the obstinate)</em>, an adjectival form of <em>šûb</em> used substantively, means “treacherous, backslider.” Although it often refers to “treacherous and willful apostates” within Israel, it also refers to willful and refractory peoples outside the covenant, as in Jer 49:4 (of the Ammonites) and here (of the Assyrians). NAC (pages 64–65) says: “Their enemies will divide up their land. The Lord will take it away from the scheming land-grabbers in Israel. He will give their fields to the treacherous Assyrians (see Isa 33:1).” KD’s and Hillers’ description of these people does not fit neatly with either of the other two categories. KD (page 299) calls them “the heathen.” Hillers (page 31) calls them “groups of people whom the wealthy and powerful of Micah’s time would regard as religiously inferior.” The KJV does not identify or hint at any particular group. It has “he hath divided our fields.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>has allotted:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase literally means “to divide or apportion.” It means that God gave or assigned their various fields to other people. Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>our fields are <u>portioned out</u> (NAB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>my people’s land has been <u>divided up</u> (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>…has taken our land away And <u>given</u> it… (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>our fields:</strong> The word <em>fields</em> refers especially to farmland. It refers to the same kind of inherited property that was referred to by the word “portion” in 2:4d. It included homes and other property as well as land.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>traitors:</strong> Here is another way in addition to the GNT and NCV (quoted above) to translate this word:</p><p><em>the conqueror (NET)</em></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The quote ends at the end of this verse part. If in your language a direct quote ends with an expression such as “that is what he said,” you may want to use a similar expression at the end of verse 4. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">That is what those people will sing to make fun of you.</span> ” That is what the LORD said.</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:4c–f (pronouns)</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Different first-person pronouns are used in the four lines of this song</u>: “we” in 2:4c, “my” in 2:4d, “me” in 2:4e, “our” in 2:4f.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The <u>first and last are plural</u> and the <u>middle two are singular</u>. In Hebrew poetry, it is common to change from one kind of pronoun to another, but in some languages, it may be unnatural or confusing. It is also unnatural in English, so some versions change the pronouns “my” and “me” in 2:4d–e to “our” and “us.” All the first-person pronouns are then plural. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>4c</sup>“<u>We</u> are completely ruined. <sup>4d</sup>The Lord gives <u>our</u> people’s possessions <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to others</span>. <sup>4e</sup>He takes them from <u>us</u>. <sup>4f</sup>He divides <u>our</u> fields among <u>our</u> captors.” (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Consider doing something similar if it will be preferable in your language.</p><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:4c–f (combine/reorder)</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">These three lines are about the LORD taking away the people’s land and giving it to others. In some languages, it may be more natural to combine and/or reorder these lines. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>4c</sup>We are completely ruined! <sup>4d–e</sup>The Lord has taken our land away <sup>4f</sup>And given it to those who took us captive.” (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"></p></div>",

The Notes will keep the same paragraph along with the NRSV and some other versions. You may do whatever is more natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Therefore:</strong> This word introduces another <u>conclusion</u> or <u>result</u> of 2:1–2, which described the deeds of wicked people. Micah here described another thing that would happen to those wicked people.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you will have no one in the assembly of the LORD to divide the land by lot:</strong> This clause probably refers to the time after the Jews returned from exile.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Apart from NAC, all the scholars who commented on the time issue indicated a preference for a time following the Jews’ return from exile or in the more distant eschatological future. These commentaries include Mays, UBS, WBC, KD, ZIBBC, TOTC, and Waltke 2007.</span></span> At that time, the descendants of the wicked people described in 2:1–2 will not receive any of the land that is distributed.

Both the TN Notes and Display will follow the textual and interpretation recommendations in the use of quotation marks in quoted versions, regardless of the actual quotation marks found in those versions.</p><h4>2:6</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:6, Micah quoted the words of people who did not like his message.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6a</sup>“Do not preach,” they preach.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6b</sup>“Do not preach these things;</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6c</sup>disgrace will not overtake us.”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">There are two main ways to interpret the identity of these people:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>They were <u>people</u> who did not like the message of Micah or other true prophets. These were probably wicked people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6a</sup>The people preach at me and say, “Don’t preach at us. (GNT) <em>(NLT, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>They were <u>prophets</u> who did not like the message of Micah or other true prophets. They were probably false prophets. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6a</sup>“Do not prophesy,” their prophets say.

Commentaries that support interpretation (2) include KD, ABC, NICOT, EBC, A&amp;F, NAC, TOTC and Waltke 2007.</span></span> A reference to people in general would also include false prophets. Versions that are not listed under the above two interpretations use general words such as “you,” “one,” or “they.” In your translation, it is recommended that you use a general word like one of these. If that is not suitable for your language, then use a phrase such as “people” or “some people.”</p><h4>2:6a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:6a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Do not preach,” they preach.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ “Stop preaching!” That is what they/people preach to me.</p></li><li><p>¶ Here is the message that some people preach/announce to me: “Do not preach/announce that message to us<sup>(excl)</sup>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>“Do not preach,” they preach:</strong> Micah here quoted words that were spoken by people who did not like his message. When these people said this, they themselves were preaching.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In Hebrew, the command “<em>Do not preach</em>” is <u>plural</u>. When the people said this to Micah, they included other prophets and their disciples as well. For example, Isaiah and Hosea lived at the same time as Micah. They also said that God would punish the Jewish people (TOTC).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>preach:</strong> In Hebrew, this word for <em>preach</em> occurs three times in this verse. It literally means “drip.” Here it means “to prophesy, preach, proclaim a message.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NJB translates this command as “Do not drivel.” No other versions have similar renderings. A footnote in the NET says: <em>Heb</em> “‘Do not foam at the mouth,’…” The verb (nataf) means “to drip.” When used of speech it probably has the nuance “to drivel, to foam at the mouth” (HALOT 694). The sinful people tell the LORD’s prophets not to “foam at the mouth.” This “probably refers in a derogatory way to their impassioned style of delivery.” Waltke 2007 and Hillers both say that the word may have the connotation of contempt, but other commentaries disagree. According to EBC (page 512), the primary meaning of the verb is “to drip.” It is a “figure used for words issuing from the lips. It predominantly describes prophetic speech. A&amp;F (pages 302–303) give the most complete defense of the often neutral and even positive connotation of words that “drip from the lips.” According to them, “the connotation in Micah is undetermined, and the nuance of ‘rant’ or ‘dribble’ in frenzy is not called for.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are at least two ways you can translate this command:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a <u>specific</u> term in your language for “prophesy,” “preach,” or “proclaim a message.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“Stop preaching!” they preach. “That’s no way to <u>preach</u>… (NJPS)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“Don’t prophesy to us! Don’t <u>prophesy</u> about these things!… (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“Do not <u>proclaim/announce</u> a message like that…</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a <u>general</u> term, such as “speak about.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“Don’t <u>say such things</u>,” the people respond. “Don’t prophesy like that… (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“Don’t <u>talk about those things</u> to us<sup>(excl)</sup>…</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that the NLT uses a general term for the first command and a specific term for the second. If your language uses a phrase like “speak God’s words” or “proclaim God’s message” to translate “preach” or “prophesy,” consider using a different phrase here. Micah’s opponents did not believe that Micah’s message was truly from the LORD.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>they preach:</strong> If it is more natural in your language, you may want to put this phrase first in the sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The people preach at me and say, “Don’t preach at us… (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>2:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Do not preach these things;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“No one should preach about those things.</p></li><li><p>It is not good to preach/announce <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that Yahweh will do</span> those bad things to our<sup>(incl)</sup> people.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Do not preach these things:</strong> In Hebrew, this statement is third-person plural, “They…” It is probably a general statement, meaning “People should not preach about such things.” There are two ways you can translate this statement:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a <u>general statement</u>. Here are some other examples:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“people should not preach of such things…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“it is not fitting to talk about these things…</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a <u>command</u>.

He had prophesied that the LORD would destroy the city of Samaria (1:6–7) and that an enemy army would attack cities in Judah and send many people into exile (1:10–16). He had rebuked the people for their wicked ways and prophesied that the LORD would punish them by taking away their land (2:1–5). But many people did not like to hear Micah speak about <em>these things</em>.</p><h4>2:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>disgrace will not overtake us.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Those terrible/shameful things will never happen to us<sup>(incl)</sup>!”</p></li><li><p>Yahweh will never shame us like that.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>disgrace will not overtake us:</strong> In Hebrew, the word <em>disgrace</em> is plural.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The situation is actually more complicated. The NAB has “The shame will not withdraw.” Other versions, such as the NIV, NJB, and NRSV, also use a singular noun (“disgrace”), but have “…will not overtake us.” In Hebrew, the noun is feminine plural (“disgraces”). The NLT follows this approach with “Such disasters…” The NASB, KJV and REB follow other minor interpretations. To avoid unnecessary complexity, the Notes will not discuss them.</span></span> It probably refers to the bad things that happen that cause people to feel shame. Here are some other ways to translate 2:6c:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nothing to make us feel bad will happen!” (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Such disasters will never come our way!” (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God is not going to disgrace us.” (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>us:</strong> The pronoun <em>us</em> probably refers to the people as a whole.

Because of this, phrases like “house of Israel” and “house of Jacob,” or “children of Israel” and “children of Jacob,” have the same meaning in many verses.</span></span> Here are some other ways to translate it:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>descendants of Jacob (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people of Israel (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>2:7b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>“Is the Spirit of the LORD impatient?

But some people thought that the LORD would never become impatient with them. So they responded with this question. In Hebrew, it is literally “Has the LORD’s spirit become short?” There are two ways to interpret this question:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The word “spirit” refers to the LORD’s inner feelings. In other words, it refers to the LORD himself. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Is the Lord’s patience truly at an end? (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Has the Lord lost his patience? (GNT) <em>(ESV, NAB, NJB, NJPS, KJV, NCV, NET, NIV11, NLT96, NRSV, REB, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The word “spirit” refers to “the LORD’s Spirit.” Some versions spell the word “spirit” with a capital letter. This usually refers to the <u>Holy Spirit</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Is the Spirit of the Lord impatient? (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Is the Spirit of the Lord angry? (NIV) <em>(BSB, GW, NASB, NIV, NLT, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions and all commentaries.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A few commentaries quote a version that uses “Spirit of the LORD” with a capital “S,” but none define this phrase as referring to the Holy Spirit.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a <u>rhetorical question</u>. It expects the answer “No.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Two versions (NCV and NLT) have a different interpretation. They understand that the rhetorical question means that the LORD will not be patient. TN has not treated this as a separate interpretation issue.</span></span> Here are some ways to translate this rhetorical question:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a <u>rhetorical question</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Has Yahweh grown short-tempered? (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The LORD is not impatient, is he?</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a <u>statement</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Certainly the LORD has not become impatient.</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>2:7c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:7c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Are these the things He does?”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He would never do such things, would he?’”</p></li><li><p>Surely he will not cause those <span data-bnType=\"implied\">terrible</span> things <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span><sup>(sing)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">speak of</span> to happen <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to us</span><sup>(incl)</sup>.’”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Are these the things He does?:</strong> This is the second question that the people asked in response to Micah’s prophecy that the LORD would punish them. It is also a <u>rhetorical question</u> that expects the answer “No.” Like the previous rhetorical question, you should translate it in a natural way.</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>You can translate it as a <u>rhetorical question</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Are these his deeds? (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Would he really do such things? (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>You can translate it as a <u>statement</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He would never do such things!</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>2:7d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:7d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Do not My words bring good to him who walks uprightly?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“The words that I speak bless/prosper the people who behave in a way that is upright.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">But Yahweh says,</span> “My words cause good things to happen to those people whose actions are upright.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">To those people Yahweh says,</span> “Indeed, I promise to prosper those who do what is right.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will first discuss the rhetorical question in the entire verse part. They will then discuss the textual issue in the phrase “My words.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Do not My words bring good to him who walks uprightly?:</strong> This is a <u>rhetorical question</u>. It expects the answer “Yes.” Here are some ways to translate this rhetorical question:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a <u>rhetorical question</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not my words do good to him whose ways are upright? (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My words do good to people who live righteously, don’t they?</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a <u>statement</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My words are welcome to the person who does what is right. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My commands bring a reward for those who obey them (NET)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>My words:</strong> There is a textual issue here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Masoretic Text uses the Hebrew pronoun “my” in the phrase “my words.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not My words do good to the one walking uprightly? (NASB) <em>(BSB, ESV, KJV, NAB, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, NJPS, NLT, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The LXX (Septuagint) uses the Greek pronoun “his” in the phrase “his words.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Doesn’t he speak kindly to those who do right?” (GNT) <em>(CEV, GW, NJB, REB, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1) along with most versions and commentaries. With either option, the phrase refers to the words of the LORD that were prophesied through his prophet Micah. And with either option, the rhetorical question in 2:7d expects the answer “yes.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>My words</em> refers to the words of the LORD spoken through his prophet Micah. The LORD is the speaker starting in 2:7d and continuing until the end of chapter 2.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>bring good:</strong> The LORD said that his words <em>bring good</em>. This means that when the LORD speaks, his words will prosper or bless those people. Here are some other ways to translate “Do not my words do good…”:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Does good not come of his words? (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>To be sure, my commands bring a reward… (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Doesn’t he always bless… (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to him who walks uprightly:</strong> This phrase is an idiom that means “to behave or conduct oneself in a way that is upright and obeys the LORD’s commands.” Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who do right (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to the person who does what is right (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to people whose behavior is upright</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"></p>",

There is a textual issue in the Hebrew text that affects the presence or absence of a time phrase in this verse part:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some scholars think the original text said “And/But you<sup>(plur)</sup> rise against my people as an enemy.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The interpretation presented here is the most common of the many ways that scholars have suggested to change the Hebrew text. According to this interpretation, they change the words “and/but recently my-people” to “and/but-you<sup>(plur)</sup> against my-people.” They also change the verb from 3rd singular “he rose” to another form, such as the participle “rising.” See NET note, EBC (page 514), A&amp;F (pages 315–316), Hillers (page 35) and Waltke 2007 (page 117) for more details.

They did cruel things to the LORD’s people, treating them like an enemy would treat them. This is a general statement. In 2:1–2, Micah had already described some of the cruel things that they did. They took land and houses away from other people.</p><h4>2:8b–9b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:8b–9b, the LORD, speaking through Micah, specifically described three of the cruel things that these people did: they took robes away from men (2:8b–c), they took houses away from women (2:9a), and they took God’s blessing away from children (2:9b).</p><h4>2:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>You strip off the splendid robe</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You<sup>(plur)</sup> take away the outer garments</p></li><li><p>You forcibly take people’s coats away from them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You strip off the splendid robe:</strong> There is a textual issue here with the phrase <em>off the splendid robe</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Masoretic Text has “from in front of a garment.” It means that the outer robe would be stripped <u>from the garment underneath</u>.

However, it is also possible that the people addressed here were money-lenders and that the words should be understood figuratively. If a person borrowed money from a money-lender and could not pay it back in time, the money-lender would take the person’s coat away. In the case of a poor, homeless person, he would be left without anything to keep him warm at night. God forbade this in Exodus 22:26–27.</span></span> In Hebrew, the verb tense indicates that these people did this regularly, whenever they had the opportunity.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In Hebrew, the verb tense is imperfect.

Commentaries that support interpretation (2) include TOTC and NAC. Commentaries that support interpretation (3) include KD, WBC, EBC, and JFB. According to A&amp;F (page 313), “The abuses described in v 9 resemble those described in vv 1–5; the abuses described in v 9 have a background in war, perhaps the same war as was the occasion for the lament in 1:10–16.” Waltke 2007 (pages 118–119) says: they are returned from battle (cf. Isa 59:20, where <em>šûb</em> with the genitive also means “return from”). The qal passive participle <em>šûbê</em> is a <em>hapax legomenon</em>. BDB thinks it means “averse,” but this is an overly extended meaning of “return.” The passive, “returned,” indicates that the subject has been acted upon, though, as often, the agent is unnamed and impersonal. Our poet uses military imagery throughout the verse. Many scholars want to add “like,” but he began the metaphor when he called the powerful “enemies.” In support of interpretation (2), NAC (pages 67–68) says: “he charges them with attacking innocent passers-by as if they were enemies…The latter thought they were as safe as soldiers returning from a battle they had won.”</span></span> Few versions follow interpretation (3).</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:8c–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to combine and/or reorder these two lines.

These women were the LORD’s people. In the Jewish culture, men were the ones who usually owned houses, so these women were probably widows.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>It is possible that some of these women had husbands who had been sold into slavery (UBS, page 163), but almost all commentaries agree that these women were probably widows.

The LORD had promised the Jews that he would give them that land. But because of their evil deeds, they would need to leave. An enemy army would capture them and take them away as prisoners.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Arise and depart:</strong> In Hebrew, the two verbs in this command emphasize the command to leave.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In a similar way, Micah used the command “arise” along with another verb in 4:13 and 6:1.</span></span> If it is more natural in your language to use just one verb, you may do so. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Get out of here,…!

Here this verb means basically the same thing as “Go!” In idiomatic English, we can say, “Go on! Leave!”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for:</strong> The conjunction <em>for</em> introduces the reason why the people must leave their land. Some versions leave this conjunction implicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Get up and go; there is no safety here any more. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Get out of here, you crooks! You’ll find no rest here. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>this:</strong> The word <em>this</em> refers to the land or country in which the Jews lived.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>is not your place of rest:</strong> Hundreds of years earlier, the LORD had promised the Jews that this land would be a place for them to rest. (See Deuteronomy 12:9–10; 25:19.) But now he told them that this land would no longer be a place like this. A <em>place of rest</em> means “a place where people can live in safety and peace.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate 2:10a (in addition to the versions quoted above):</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Get up and leave. This is not your place of rest anymore. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Up! Begone! This is no longer your land and home.

The CEV has “you will be destroyed,” referring to the people, but does not give a reason. The KJV has “it shall destroy [you],” referring to the land destroying the people. TOTC and A&amp;F support the interpretation that it is primarily the people who are unclean, not the land.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because its defilement brings destruction—a grievous destruction!:</strong> In Hebrew, this verse part is literally “uncleanness will destroy, and destruction will be severe.” This verse part gives the reason why the land is no longer a place of rest (2:10a). The reason is that the people had sinned through their worship of idols (ch. 1), and through the way they had oppressed their fellow Jews (2:1–9). Their sins had caused the land to become “unclean,” “defiled,” or “impure.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>EBC (page 514) mentions the dual sins of the people. CBC (page 313) also mentions the sin of idolatry and refers to the similar situation in Hosea in which the Israelites were “expelled from their land and exiled to Assyria (Hos 5:3; 6:10; 9:3–4).” CBC and NAC both reference Leviticus 18:24–28, which describes the land’s defilement because of the sins of the people.</span></span> As a result, the LORD said that the land was doomed to “severe” or extreme destruction.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>because its defilement:</strong> Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You have made this place unclean (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for you have filled it with sin (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a grievous destruction:</strong> The NCV correctly expresses the reason for the destruction. The GNT is similar. It has “your sins have doomed this place to destruction.” But these renderings fail to emphasize the extreme nature of the destruction that is indicated by the word “severe” in Hebrew. Here are some other ways to express this emphasis:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because it is defiled, it is <u>ruined</u>, <u>beyond all remedy</u> (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because of the uncleanness that brings on <u>destruction</u>, <u>a painful destruction</u> (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Sin will <u>thoroughly destroy</u> it!

Some of the words have more than one meaning. They are also connected to each other in different ways. The Notes will give the most likely meaning rather than try to lay out multiple interpretation issues.</span></span> These words describe any man who said/claimed he was a prophet, but his message was not from the LORD.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a man of wind:</strong> In some languages, it may be clearer to translate this phrase as a plural. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>Liars and frauds</u> may go around and say (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>If <u>people</u> come telling many lies</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>of wind…say falsely:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase (“wind and falsehood lies”) has two aspects of meaning:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The false prophet said things that were worthless.

This probably means that he predicted that the people would have lots of wine and strong drink. The implication is that they would have good crops and a prosperous life.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>preach:</strong> The word <em>preach</em> is the same word that is found three times in Micah 2:6. It means “to preach, to proclaim a message.” See the note at 2:6a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to you:</strong> In Hebrew, the pronoun <em>you</em> is singular. But it clearly refers to the Jewish people. So in most languages, it will probably be more natural to use a plural pronoun.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>wine and strong drink:</strong> In Hebrew, the phrase <em>wine and strong drink</em> refers to wine and beer.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Waltke 2007 (pages 123–124) points out that although <em>šēḵār</em> almost always occurs together with <em>yayin</em> and “denotes not just barley beer but any alcoholic beverage, the article with ‘wine and beer’ marks them out as belonging to a class unique and determined in themselves. Both are light intoxicants, about 7–10 percent alcoholic content, by comparison with modern liquors and strong drinks.”</span></span> Both wine and beer are alcoholic drinks that contain a small percentage of alcohol. If your language does not have specific words for wine and beer, you may use a general phrase such as “intoxicating drinks” or “drinks that can make a person drunk.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this verse part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will prophesy for you plenty of wine and beer (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I’ll promise you blessings of wine and beer (NET)</p></blockquote><h4>2:11c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:11c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>he would be just the preacher for this people!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>that is the kind of preacher/prophet that these people want to listen to.”</p></li><li><p>These <span data-bnType=\"implied\">evil</span> people like to listen to people who preach/prophesy that kind of message.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he would be just the preacher for this people!:</strong> This verse part shows <u>sarcasm</u>. The LORD said this to show that he was angry with these evil people. If a true prophet preached to them a message from the LORD, they said “Do not preach” (2:6). But if a false prophet preached a worthless message about wine and beer, that is the kind of preacher these people liked to hear. Here are some other ways to translate this verse part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>That would be the kind of preacher these people would like.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You people would enjoy a preacher who said things like that.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>this people:</strong> This phrase refers to the people that the LORD has been speaking to in 2:8–10. Notice that in 2:8–10, the LORD spoke <u>to</u> these people, but here in 2:11, he spoke <u>about</u> them. If this will confuse your readers, you can translate this people as “you” or “people like you.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But <u>you people</u> want a false prophet who will tell you nothing but lies.

But in some languages, it may be necessary to make clear who the speaker is. The LORD was clearly the speaker in verse 12. There are three ways to interpret the identity of the speaker here in verse 13:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p><u>Micah</u> is the speaker. The GNT has a closing quotation mark (”) at the end of 2:12 to show that the LORD stopped speaking there. <em>(GNT)</em></p></li><li><p><u>The LORD</u> is still the speaker in 2:13. The CEV indicates this by using the pronoun “I.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will break down the gate and lead them out—then I will be their king. (CEV) <em>The NIV and some other versions have an open quotation mark (“) at the beginning of verse 12 and a closing quotation mark (”) at the end of verse 13 to show that the LORD is the speaker in both verses.</em> <em>(CEV, NASB, NCV, NIV, NLT)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Although the CEV does not use quotation marks, v.13 is clearly a continuation of v.12 which identifies “I the Lord” as the speaker.</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The speaker is not identified. No quotation marks are used in 2:12–13 to help the reader know who the speaker is. <em>(BSB, GW, KJV, NAB, NET, NJB, NJPS, NRSV, REB)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will follow interpretation (1) along with most of the commentaries that discuss the issue.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Most commentaries do not comment on who the speaker is in v.13. Commentaries that support interpretation (1) include UBS, NAC, Waltke 2007, and probably A&amp;F. No commentaries used in the Notes clearly supported interpretation (2).</span></span> In verse 13, the name “the LORD” appears. Also, the phrases “the one who breaks out” and “their king” probably refer to the LORD. Because of this, it is simplest to understand verse 13 as the words of <u>Micah</u> speaking about the LORD.

He will lead them out <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the city</span>.</p></li><li><p>Their leader will knock down the wall so they can leave and will go ahead of them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>One who breaks open the way will go up before them:</strong> This phrase refers to the leader of the people. He will make a gap in the wall around the city where his people have been in captivity or exile and will lead them as they escape. There are two main ways to identify this leader:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Leave the <u>identity of the leader unspecified</u> in 2:13a, though his actions are specified. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Someone</u> will open the way and lead the people out. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Their leader</u> breaks out before them (REB) <em>(BSB, KJV, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, NJB, NJPS, NLT, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p><u>Specify</u> that <u>the leader</u> is the LORD (God). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>God</u> will open the way for them and lead them out of exile. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The Lord</span> will open the way and lead them. (GW) <em>(CEV, GW, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow choice (1). Do not specify the identity of the leader in 2:13a. Wait until 2:13c before you further identify this leader. The one who <em>breaks open</em> is someone who will lead the Jewish people back home. It could refer to their <u>king</u>, or to the <u>Messiah</u>,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>No version specifies that the “one who breaks out” is “the Messiah,” but Pusey, NAC, KD, EBC, ABC, and CBC all mention the role of the Messiah in various ways. EBC (page 517) understand the “breaker” to be Israel’s King, but they also say: “The remnant will receive its final glory and vindication only through the Messiah. He will arise from his people and lead them into the security of God’s kingdom.” CBC (page 315) makes a connection between the “breaker” and Yahweh, but he comments: “Kaiser (1992:45) understands ‘the Breaker’ as a title for God and sees the role of ‘Breaker’ fulfilled ultimately in the ministry of Jesus the Messiah.” Pusey (page 37) quotes Isaiah 42:6–7 and comments: “From this passage, the ‘breaker-through’ was one of the titles of the Christ, known to the Jews…” KD (page 304) says: “the breaker through, who goes before them, is not Jehovah, but…in the highest sense Christ, who opens the prison-doors, and redeems the captives of Zion (vid., Isa. 42:7).”</span></span> or to <u>the LORD</u> himself.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>breaks open the way:</strong> It is implied that the people are <u>inside a walled city</u>. Their leader will lead the people out of the city. The city was a figure of speech for <u>captivity or exile</u>. Some English versions make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Someone will open the way and lead the people out. The people will break through the gate and <u>leave the city where they were held captive</u>. (2:13a–b, NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Your leader will break out and <u>lead you out of exile</u>, <u>out through the gates of the enemy cities</u>, back to your own land. (2:13a–b, NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>will go up before them:</strong> These words mean that the leader will walk in front of the people to lead them out of the city. It does not mean that they will go uphill. See the NCV and NLT (quoted above).</p><h4>2:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>they will break through the gate, and go out by it.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Then the people will break open the city gate and go out through it.</p></li><li><p>The people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will follow him out</span>. They will break open the gate <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the city where they had been captives/exiled</span> and leave.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they will break through the gate, and go out by it:</strong> The pronoun <em>they</em> refers to the people and their leader. They will leave the city through the broken gate or doorway in the wall around the city. Here are some other ways to translate this verse part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They will break out, go through the gate, and leave. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they will break through the gate and go out (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They will break out of the city gates and go free. (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>2:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Their King will pass through before them, the LORD as their leader.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Their king will lead the way, and Yahweh will go in front of them.</p></li><li><p>Their king will walk in front of them. Yahweh himself will lead them out.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Their King will pass through before them, the LORD as their leader:</strong> In 2:13a, the leader of the people is identified as the “one who breaks out.” The two phrases of 2:13c identify the one who leads the whole group as <em>Their King</em> and <em>the LORD</em>. As was mentioned in the note on 2:13a, the “one who breaks out” could be their king, the Messiah, or the LORD. Here in 2:13c, versions translate the two phrases in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>In some versions, <u>each phrase is a separate function or name/title</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So <u>their king</u> goes on before them, <u>and the Lord</u> at their head. (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>with their king</u> leading the way <u>and with Yahweh</u> at their head (NJB) <em>(BSB, GW, KJV, NABRE, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, NJB, NJPS, NLT, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>In some versions, <u>the phrase</u> <em>Their King</em> <u>refers to</u> <u>the LORD</u>.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Their king, the Lord himself</u>, will lead them out. (GNT) <em>(CEV, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow choice (1). This choice allows your readers to interpret the specific relationships or roles of the leader(s) mentioned in 2:13a and 2:13c according to their own understanding of Scripture as a whole.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>will pass through before them…as their leader:</strong> These two phrases, as well as the phrase “will go up before them” in 2:13a, all refer to someone who precedes others. In 2:13a–b, the phrases clearly refer to going outside the city through the broken wall and gate. The two phrases in 2:13c may refer to leading the people as they continue on their journey home.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to NAC (pages 70–71), “The ultimate, complete fulfillment of vv. 12–13 extends to the future coming of the Messiah and even to his second advent and millennial reign for the final stage in the progressive fulfillment of the whole.” Waltke 2007 (page 136) says: “Whether or not this is a salvation oracle, the accidental perfective vividly and dramatically represents the future as a single independent situation.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">See Overall structure of the book in the Introduction for more details about the three divisions.</p>",

He spoke to the leaders of the Jews and to the prophets. He rebuked (scolded) them for their wicked deeds. He also told them that God would punish the nation because of them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will divide this section into three paragraphs:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>In 3:1–4, Micah rebuked the <u>judicial leaders</u>.</p></li><li><p>In 3:5–8, Micah rebuked the <u>wicked prophets</u>.</p></li><li><p>In 3:9–12, Micah rebuked <u>all the leaders</u>: judges, prophets, and priests.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">In each paragraph, Micah used the word “justice” (3:1, 8, 9). In each paragraph, he first rebuked the leaders for their evil deeds. Then he described what would happen as a result of their wickedness. Some versions begin a new paragraph at verse 4 or verse 8. It is recommended that you follow the paragraphs used in the Notes.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples of section headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Micah Denounces Israel’s Leaders (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Leaders and Prophets Rebuked (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Israel’s Sinful Leaders—Rulers, Prophets, and Priests (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Wicked Rulers and Prophets (NRSV)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1033003001\" data-endVerseId=\"1033003004\"><h3>Paragraph 3:1–4</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, Micah first spoke <u>to</u> the judicial leaders of Israel. He accused them of doing evil and cruel things (verses 1–3). Then he spoke <u>about</u> them. He said that the LORD would punish them (verse 4).</p></div><h4>3:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Then I said: “Hear now, O leaders of Jacob, you rulers of the house of Israel.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Then/And I said: Listen, you<sup>(plur)</sup> leaders of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the descendants of</span> Jacob! <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Listen, you</span> rulers of the people of Israel!</p></li><li><p>¶ Pay attention to what I say, you rulers of Jacob<span data-bnType=\"implied\">’s descendants</span>, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who serve as</span> judges for the nation of Israel.</p></li><li><p>(combined/reordered)</p></li><li><p>¶ You who rule/lead and judge the Jewish people, listen to my message!</p></li><li><p>¶ Now I speak to you leaders of Israel. Listen to what I say.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Then I said: “Hear now, O leaders of Jacob, you rulers of the house of Israel:</strong> It is unusual for a prophet to begin his message with the words <em>Then I said</em>. Perhaps Micah used these words because he began a new message here. Here is another way to introduce this message:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I said (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions make the words <em>Then I said</em> implicit and begin this verse with the command to listen. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Listen, you rulers of Israel! (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Introduce this message in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Hear now:</strong> In Hebrew, this is the same word as the word “hear” that Micah used in 1:2a. It means “Listen carefully!” or “Pay attention!”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>O leaders…you rulers:</strong> These two words are synonyms that mean “chiefs” or “leaders.” They both refer to local leaders who did the work of judges. They listened to disputes, investigated crimes, and punished criminals.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Commentaries agree that the parallel terms “heads” and “rulers” refer to officials whose duties were primarily or totally judicial in nature. A&amp;F (page 339–340) say that they were “some kind of civil magistrates” that were ultimately responsible to the king. 2 Chronicles 19:4–11 describes how Jehoshaphat appointed judges in all the fortified towns of Judah, and according to A&amp;F (page 351), there is no evidence “that the traditional village courts had been abolished or curtailed by Micah’s time.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>of Jacob…of the house of Israel:</strong> The name <em>Jacob</em> means the “descendants of Jacob.” The phrase <em>house of Israel</em> means the “people/nation of Israel.” Together, these parallel phrases refer to <u>all the Jews</u>. Micah used these same two phrases in 1:5a–b. See the Notes there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate the part of 3:1a that begins with the command to listen:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Listen, leaders of the people of Jacob; listen, you rulers of the nation of Israel. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Listen, you who rule the descendants of Jacob, you who judge the country of the Jews.</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:1a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to combine and/or reorder some of the parallel parts in this line. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Listen to me, you rulers of Israel! (CEV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>3:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Should you not know justice?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Are you<sup>(plur)</sup> not supposed to be skilled at ruling justly?</p></li><li><p>You know that you ought to govern fairly, do you not?</p></li><li><p>You should be fair in the way you judge legal cases/disputes.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Should you not know justice?:</strong> This is a <u>rhetorical question</u> that <u>expects the answer “Yes.”</u> Micah used this question to rebuke the leaders. His question <u>implies that they did not rule with justice</u>. Here are some ways to translate this rhetorical question:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate it as a <u>rhetorical question</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Is it not your duty to know what is right (NAB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You should know how to rule justly, should you not?</p></blockquote></li><li><p><u>Change the question so that it is clearly a rebuke</u> in your language.

In some languages, it may be natural to translate this rebuke as a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So why do you hate doing what is right and love doing what is evil?</p></blockquote><h4>3:2b–3e</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In verses 2b–c and 3a–e, Micah used a horrifying extended metaphor to describe the extreme cruelty of the evil rulers toward the people. Most scholars think that Micah was comparing the evil rulers to people who ate human flesh or to butchers who chopped up meat. Parts of the metaphor may also refer to ritual human sacrifices or to the cruelty of the Assyrians, who sometimes flayed the skin off their captives.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TOTC, Waltke 1993, and Waltke 2007 say that the metaphor refers to cannibalism, as do ABC and IVPB. UBS (pages 170–171) suggests either one comparison (cannibals) or two comparisons (a butcher and wild animals). NICOT, EBC, and NAC prefer the analogy of a butcher, as does KD (page 306), who summarizes the details as “treat them like cattle.” ZIBBC (page 133) speaks of the “horrors of human sacrifice.” A&amp;F (page 353) mention the practice of sacrificing children in the fire and references 2 Kings 16:3 and 17:16–17, but they also say that the wording here does not support the idea of ritual sacrifice and that there is “no information as to whether human flesh was actually consumed.” They make the point that “cannibalism under duress” is a very different thing from eating “a human out of sheer malevolence” and say it is unlikely that “the entire leadership of Israel engaged in such practices together.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">The parts of this metaphor are in the form of a seven-line chiasm. The main point occurs in the third line (3a). Verses 2b and 3b form a pair, as do 2c and 3c. Verses 3d–e are connected to 3c as part of the overall cooking process.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to Waltke 1993 (page 658), the similes in the last lines of verse 3 add further details to the incomplete metaphors in the first part of the verse. Waltke 2007 (page 149) comments that the first three clauses of v.3 probably represent “three aspects of one situation” and that “the repetition of their skin and bones…emphasizes and confirms the cannibalism of the culprits.”</span></span> Chronologically, 2b–c and 3b–e precede the main point in 3a.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2b</sup>You tear the skin from my people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2c</sup>and strip the flesh from their bones.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>3a</sup>You eat the flesh of my people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>3b</sup>after stripping off their skin</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>3c</sup>and breaking their bones.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>3d</sup>You chop them up like flesh for the cooking pot,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>3e</sup>like meat in a caldron.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">See the General Comment at the end of the note on 3:3d–e for ways to translate this metaphor and to make the lines chronological.</p><h4>3:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>You tear the skin from my people</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You<sup>(plur)</sup> pull off the skin of my countrymen,</p></li><li><p>You <span data-bnType=\"implied\">oppress</span> my fellow Jews. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Your cruelty can be compared to someone who</span> skins <span data-bnType=\"implied\">another person</span> while they are still alive,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You tear the skin from my people:</strong> To <em>tear the skin from</em> means “to pull or peel the skin off a person’s body.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>my people:</strong> This phrase does not occur here in Hebrew.

He spoke to the leaders of the Jews and to the prophets. He rebuked (scolded) them for their wicked deeds. He also told them that God would punish the nation because of them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will divide this section into three paragraphs:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>In 3:1–4, Micah rebuked the <u>judicial leaders</u>.</p></li><li><p>In 3:5–8, Micah rebuked the <u>wicked prophets</u>.</p></li><li><p>In 3:9–12, Micah rebuked <u>all the leaders</u>: judges, prophets, and priests.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">In each paragraph, Micah used the word “justice” (3:1, 8, 9).

The point is that the wicked leaders treated the common people with extreme cruelty. They wrongfully deprived them of their land and property and everything that they needed to stay alive.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Here are some of the cruel things these leaders did: They took land and houses away from poor people (Micah 2:2; Micah 2:8–9), they took bribes (Micah 3:11a), and they did not help widows and orphans (see Psalm 82:1–4; Isaiah 1:17, 23; Jeremiah 22:3). Here are some other verses in which cruel people are compared to those who eat human flesh: Psalms 14:4; Proverbs 30:14; Zephaniah 3:3.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Micah compared their cruelty to people who would enjoy eating the flesh of their fellow countrymen. He was probably <u>not</u> referring to ritual cannibalism or to mothers who ate dead children to avoid starvation during the siege of Samaria (2 Kings 6:29).

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Someday <u>these sinners</u> will cry to the Lord for help (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>will cry out to the LORD:</strong> This phrase means that they will call out loudly to the LORD.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Then</u> you will cry to the Lord, <sup>b</sup>but he will not answer you. <sup>c</sup>He will hide his face from you <u>at that time</u> because you have done evil things.

(CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice that the GW uses separate time phrases for 4a and 4c. The CEV combines 4b–d into one line.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">If it is clearer or more natural in your language to use “you” pronouns in 3:4 as well as 3:1–3, you may do so.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"></p></div>",

He first described the way in which they misled the people (3:5). He then described their future punishment by God (3:6–7). He concluded by contrasting his own status as a true prophet (3:8).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Micah began this paragraph with the phrase “Thus says the LORD.” This phrase indicates that his message came from the LORD. But it is not clear which verses are a direct quote of the LORD’s words. In the examples below, the verse parts may differ, depending on the version. Here are the main interpretations:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><u>All of verses 5–8 are Micah’s words</u>. These verses are the message that he received from the LORD. The lack of quotation marks indicates that he did not quote the LORD’s words directly.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Interpretation (1) is supported by WBC 1984 (pages 32–33).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5a</sup>Thus says the Lord concerning the prophets who lead my people astray;…<sup>6a</sup>Therefore it will be night for you…<sup>7a</sup>The seers will be ashamed…<sup>8a</sup>On the other hand I am filled with power… (NASB) <em>(ESV, GW, KJV, NAB, NASB, NJB, NRSV, REB)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NJPS does not use any quote marks in 3:5–8. It has not been listed under interpretation (1), because it spells the phrase “My people” with a capital letter, referring to the LORD.</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Verses 5b–7 are a direct quote of the LORD’s words. The quote is marked with quotation marks. <u>Verse 8 is Micah’s words</u>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Interpretation (2) is supported by Hillers (page 44).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5a</sup>This is what the Lord says: <sup>5b</sup>“As for the prophets who lead my people astray…. <sup>7b</sup>They will all cover their faces because there is no answer from God.” <sup>8a</sup>But as for me… (NIV) <em>(BSB, NCV, NET, NIV, NLT)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NET includes 3:8 in the same paragraph as 3:5–7. In the NCV, NIV, and NLT, 3:8 starts a new paragraph.</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Verse 3:6 is a direct quote of the LORD’s words. <u>Verses 5, 7, and 8 are Micah’s words</u>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Interpretation (3) is supported by TOTC, Waltke 1993, and Waltke 2007.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5</sup>My people are deceived by prophets…To these prophets the Lord says, <sup>6</sup>“Prophets, your day is almost over;…you will not be able to predict anything.” <sup>7</sup>Those who predict…<sup>8</sup>But as for me,… (GNT) <em>(GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Verses 6–7 are a direct quote of the LORD’s words. <u>Verses 5 and 8 are Micah’s words</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5</sup>You lying prophets…Here is what the Lord says to you prophets: <sup>6</sup>“You will live in the dark…<sup>7</sup>You prophets…no message from me.” <sup>8</sup>But the Lord has filled me… (CEV) <em>(CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). It is the simplest. Micah is the speaker in each of the three paragraphs in this section (3:1–12).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The meaning of these verses is almost the same with all four interpretations. Regardless of the quote marks, Micah’s message came to him from the LORD. His audience understood that he claimed to be the LORD’s spokesman.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you decide not to follow interpretation (1), here are two things that you should consider:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>If you follow interpretation (1), (3), or (4), the phrase “my people” in 3:5a means “Micah’s people.” But if you follow interpretation (2), it means “the LORD’s people.”</p></li><li><p>If you follow interpretation (2) or (4), the phrase “there is no answer from God” (3:7d) may need to be translated “there is no answer from <u>me</u>.”</p></li></ul></div><h4>3:5</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Verse 3:5a gives a general reason for Micah’s rebuke of the prophets. Verses 3:5b–c give more details.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A&amp;F (page 364), Waltke 1993 (page 662).</span></span></p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5a</sup>This is what the LORD says: “As for the prophets who lead My people astray,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5b</sup>who proclaim peace while they chew with their teeth,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5c</sup>but declare war against one who puts nothing in their mouths:</p></blockquote><h4>3:5a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:5a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>This is what the LORD says: “As for the prophets who lead My people astray,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ This is what Yahweh says about the prophets who deceive/mislead my people/countrymen.</p></li><li><p>¶ Here is a message from Yahweh.

See how you translated the same phrase in 2:3a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>As for the prophets:</strong> This phrase indicates that Micah’s message was <u>about</u> the prophets. Here is another way to translate these two phrases:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This is what the Lord says <u>about</u> the prophets… (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who lead My people astray:</strong> Some translations interpret the Hebrew phrase “my people” as referring to Micah’s people, since Micah is the one quoting God. The BSB chose to translate the phrase <em>My people</em> to refer to God’s people. The phrase <em>My people</em> refers to <u>Micah’s</u> people. See the Note about this phrase at 1:9c.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>lead…astray</em> (present tense) means that the wicked prophets <u>habitually</u> or <u>frequently</u> pretended that their messages were from the LORD. But actually, their words were lies that <u>deceived or misled the people</u>. They did not warn the people that the LORD would punish them if they did not turn from their sins.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who regularly deceive my people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who mislead my people (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who teach my people the wrong way to live (based on NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>3:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who proclaim peace while they chew with their teeth,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>If people give those prophets food, they loudly say, “All will go well for you<sup>(plur)</sup>!”</p></li><li><p>If people feed those prophets <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as payment for their message</span>, they proclaim this message: “You will prosper!”</p></li><li><p>Those prophets speak a good message to people who give them food. They promise them, “You will have a good life!”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who proclaim peace while they chew with their teeth:</strong> In Hebrew, the verb <em>proclaim</em> means “to <u>speak loudly</u>,” “to <u>proclaim a message</u>.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>peace:</strong> These prophets proclaim that there will be <em>peace</em> (<em>šalom</em> in Hebrew). This word means more than just no fighting or no noise. It means “wholeness,” “prosperity,” or “well-being.” It refers to the happy life of a person whom God blesses.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>UBS (page 174).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural to translate <em>peace</em> as a sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>“You will prosper.”</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>“Your life will be happy and safe.”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>while they chew with their teeth:</strong> Here, this clause means “to bite food,” in other words, to eat.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this verse part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who promise prosperity in return for food (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>If these prophets are given food to eat, they shout, “Peace!” (NCV, quote marks adjusted)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>If people give those prophets food to eat, they loudly proclaim this message, “You will be safe and happy.”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It was the custom in Israel to give food or money to prophets to help them. But the prophets that Micah talked about here were not honest. If people paid them or gave them food, they preached messages of peace and prosperity instead of warning the people to repent.</p><h4>3:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but declare war against one who puts nothing in their mouths:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But if people do not feed them, they fight a war against them.</p></li><li><p>But they oppose any people who do not give them food.</p></li><li><p>But if people don’t give them anything <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as payment</span>, they threaten them, saying, “The Lord will destroy you!”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but declare war against one who puts nothing in their mouths:</strong> If a person did not give food to these prophets, they did not preach messages of peace and prosperity. Instead they <em>declare war against</em> those people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>declare war:</strong> Other versions translate this phrase in these ways:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>prepare to wage war (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>threaten war (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>declare a holy war (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a figure of speech called a <u>hyperbole</u>. These prophets did not literally <em>declare war</em> against people who did not give them food. Perhaps the prophets spoke angrily to them. Perhaps they preached messages against them. Perhaps they cursed them, saying, “God will destroy you!”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If a literal translation of this figure of speech is not clear or natural, you may want to translate it another way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But if people do not give them food to eat, they <u>threaten disaster</u> on them.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But they <u>speak angrily against</u> anyone who does not give them food.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"></p>",

He spoke to the leaders of the Jews and to the prophets. He rebuked (scolded) them for their wicked deeds. He also told them that God would punish the nation because of them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will divide this section into three paragraphs:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>In 3:1–4, Micah rebuked the <u>judicial leaders</u>.</p></li><li><p>In 3:5–8, Micah rebuked the <u>wicked prophets</u>.</p></li><li><p>In 3:9–12, Micah rebuked <u>all the leaders</u>: judges, prophets, and priests.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">In each paragraph, Micah used the word “justice” (3:1, 8, 9). In each paragraph, he first rebuked the leaders for their evil deeds. Then he described what would happen as a result of their wickedness. Some versions begin a new paragraph at verse 4 or verse 8. It is recommended that you follow the paragraphs used in the Notes.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples of section headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Micah Denounces Israel’s Leaders (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Leaders and Prophets Rebuked (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Israel’s Sinful Leaders—Rulers, Prophets, and Priests (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Wicked Rulers and Prophets (NRSV)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1033003005\" data-endVerseId=\"1033003008\"><h3>Paragraph 3:5–8</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, Micah rebuked the wicked prophets. He first described the way in which they misled the people (3:5). He then described their future punishment by God (3:6–7). He concluded by contrasting his own status as a true prophet (3:8).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Micah began this paragraph with the phrase “Thus says the LORD.” This phrase indicates that his message came from the LORD. But it is not clear which verses are a direct quote of the LORD’s words. In the examples below, the verse parts may differ, depending on the version. Here are the main interpretations:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><u>All of verses 5–8 are Micah’s words</u>. These verses are the message that he received from the LORD. The lack of quotation marks indicates that he did not quote the LORD’s words directly.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Interpretation (1) is supported by WBC 1984 (pages 32–33).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5a</sup>Thus says the Lord concerning the prophets who lead my people astray;…<sup>6a</sup>Therefore it will be night for you…<sup>7a</sup>The seers will be ashamed…<sup>8a</sup>On the other hand I am filled with power… (NASB) <em>(ESV, GW, KJV, NAB, NASB, NJB, NRSV, REB)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NJPS does not use any quote marks in 3:5–8. It has not been listed under interpretation (1), because it spells the phrase “My people” with a capital letter, referring to the LORD.</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Verses 5b–7 are a direct quote of the LORD’s words. The quote is marked with quotation marks. <u>Verse 8 is Micah’s words</u>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Interpretation (2) is supported by Hillers (page 44).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5a</sup>This is what the Lord says: <sup>5b</sup>“As for the prophets who lead my people astray…. <sup>7b</sup>They will all cover their faces because there is no answer from God.” <sup>8a</sup>But as for me… (NIV) <em>(BSB, NCV, NET, NIV, NLT)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NET includes 3:8 in the same paragraph as 3:5–7. In the NCV, NIV, and NLT, 3:8 starts a new paragraph.</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Verse 3:6 is a direct quote of the LORD’s words. <u>Verses 5, 7, and 8 are Micah’s words</u>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Interpretation (3) is supported by TOTC, Waltke 1993, and Waltke 2007.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5</sup>My people are deceived by prophets…To these prophets the Lord says, <sup>6</sup>“Prophets, your day is almost over;…you will not be able to predict anything.” <sup>7</sup>Those who predict…<sup>8</sup>But as for me,… (GNT) <em>(GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Verses 6–7 are a direct quote of the LORD’s words. <u>Verses 5 and 8 are Micah’s words</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5</sup>You lying prophets…Here is what the Lord says to you prophets: <sup>6</sup>“You will live in the dark…<sup>7</sup>You prophets…no message from me.” <sup>8</sup>But the Lord has filled me… (CEV) <em>(CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). It is the simplest. Micah is the speaker in each of the three paragraphs in this section (3:1–12).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The meaning of these verses is almost the same with all four interpretations. Regardless of the quote marks, Micah’s message came to him from the LORD. His audience understood that he claimed to be the LORD’s spokesman.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you decide not to follow interpretation (1), here are two things that you should consider:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>If you follow interpretation (1), (3), or (4), the phrase “my people” in 3:5a means “Micah’s people.” But if you follow interpretation (2), it means “the LORD’s people.”</p></li><li><p>If you follow interpretation (2) or (4), the phrase “there is no answer from God” (3:7d) may need to be translated “there is no answer from <u>me</u>.”</p></li></ul></div><h4>3:6</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 3:5, Micah spoke <u>about</u> the wicked prophets and the way they deceived the people. Here in 3:6, he used the metaphor of night and darkness to describe their future punishment by God. In 3:6a–b, he spoke <u>to</u> these prophets. In 3:6c–d and 3:7 he spoke <u>about</u> them again.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">For other ways to translate the change from “about” to “to” and then back to “about” again, see the General Comment on 3:5–7 at the end of the note on 3:7d.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will first discuss the details of the metaphor and the parallelism before suggesting ways to translate the verse as a whole.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The “you” pronouns in these parallel lines refer to the wicked prophets. Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6a</sup>Therefore <u>night</u> will come over you without <strong>visions</strong>,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6b</sup>and <u>darkness</u> without <strong>divination</strong>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>night will come over you…and darkness:</strong> The metaphor of <em>night</em> and <em>darkness</em> figuratively describes the punishment of the wicked prophets. Their future inability to see visions is compared to people who are unable to see things at night in the darkness.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>without visions…without divination:</strong> These parallel phrases explain the meaning of the metaphor. The metaphor means that God will not give visions or messages to those prophets in the future. He will punish them by taking away their ability to be prophets and to receive revelation.</p><h4>3:6a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:6a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Therefore night will come over you without visions,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Therefore, it will become night for you<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">prophets</span>. You will receive no visions <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from God</span>.</p></li><li><p>Therefore, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">soon</span> it will become <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> night for you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">prophets</span>. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will not show you things that are like dreams.</p></li><li><p>And so, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you prophets,</span> the time will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">soon</span> come when <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will stop giving you visions.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Therefore:</strong> This word connects verse 6 to verse 5. It introduces the result of the behavior of the wicked prophets. Here are some other ways to express this connection:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And so (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>That is why (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>visions:</strong> A “vision” is <u>like a dream</u>, but the person having a vision is not asleep. Visions are one way that God spoke to prophets. In some languages, the word <em>visions</em> may need to be translated as a phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You will not <u>see anything that is like a dream</u>.</p></blockquote><h4>3:6a–d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:6a–d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(combined/reordered)</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Therefore, the time of success for you<sup>(plur)</sup> prophets is almost finished. You will soon be in darkness. You will have no visions from God, and you will not be able to predict what will happen in the future.</p></li></ul></div><h4>3:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and darkness without divination.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It will become dark for you<sup>(plur)</sup>. Things that will happen <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the future</span> will not be revealed/shown to you.</p></li><li><p>It will be <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> dark night for you. You will no longer be able to predict the future.</p></li><li><p>Yes, you will be in the dark. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will no longer tell you what will happen in the future.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>divination:</strong> <em>divination</em> is <u>predicting</u> what will happen in the future. Micah told these prophets that they will not be able to practice <em>divination</em>, because God will not tell them anything.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Non-Jewish people who worshiped idols practiced divination. Here are some ways they did this: They threw arrows and looked at how they landed on the ground. They asked idols to help them. They looked at the liver of an animal they had killed. (See Ezekiel 21:21–22.) They asked a spirit or ghost to help them. (See Leviticus 19:31; 1 Samuel 28:7–8.) Micah’s words in Micah 3:6b imply that some of the wicked prophets also did some things that were like divination. God commanded his people not to use divination (Deuteronomy 18:10) except for the use of the Urim and Thummim by the High Priest. (See Exodus 28:30.) The term “divination” is “never used in the Bible for the activities of true prophets.” (UBS, page 176)</span></span> Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>without any way to tell the future (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you will not be able to predict anything (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate this metaphor:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Therefore you shall have night, not vision, darkness, not divination (NAB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Change the metaphor to a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Therefore, it will be <u>like</u> night and darkness for you prophets. You will have no visions from God. You will not be able to predict the future.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Therefore God will not give you visions. He will no longer tell you what will happen in the future. Instead it will be <u>as though</u> dark night surrounds you.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without using a figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And so, in the future, those prophets will no longer see any visions. They will no longer be able to use their power to predict what will happen.</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>3:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The sun will set on these prophets,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The day/time of those prophets will be finished,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It will be like</span> the sun no longer shines on those prophets.</p></li><li><p>The career/work of those prophets will stop.</p></li></ul></div><h4>3:6d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:6d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and the daylight will turn black over them.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and night will come/arrive.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It will be like</span> they are surrounded by blackness/night.</p></li><li><p>They will no longer be able to prophesy.</p></li></ul></div><h4>3:6c–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 3:6a–b, Micah used the pronoun “you.” He spoke <u>to</u> these wicked prophets. Here in 3:6c–d, Micah spoke <u>about</u> them. Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6c</sup>The <u>sun will set</u> <strong>on these prophets</strong>,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6d</sup>and the <u>daylight will turn black</u> <strong>over them</strong>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The sun will set…the daylight will turn black:</strong> Here again, Micah used darkness as a <u>metaphor</u>. He said that <em>The sun will set</em>. In other words, it will become night. He said that <em>the daylight will turn black</em>. This is a poetic way to say that it will become dark or night.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The meaning of the metaphor is that the time of these prophets will soon be finished. Their ability to prophesy will soon be gone. It will be a “dark” (sad, humiliating) time for them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate this metaphor:</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:6a–d</strong></h5><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Keep the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The sun will set for the prophets, and the day will go dark for them. (NIV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Change the metaphor to a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It will be <u>like</u> the sun has set and it has become dark. Their time of being prophets will be finished.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It will be <u>like</u> the sun is no longer shining and it has become dark. They will no longer be able to prophesy.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Yes, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the time is coming when</span> it will be <u>as though</u> the day has ended for those prophets, and it will be as though they are in darkness, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">without the ability to prophesy</span>.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without using a figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They will no longer be able to prophesy. They will be humiliated, because their career as prophets will be ended.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It will be a time of sadness for them, because they will no longer have the ability to be prophets.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">Verse 6a and 6b are parallel. Verse 6c and 6d are also parallel. Most English versions translate each of these four lines separately.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, this repetition may be confusing or unnatural. Here are some ways to combine and/or reorder these four lines to reduce the amount of repetition.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Prophets, your day is almost over; the sun is going down on you. Because you mislead my people, you will have no more prophetic visions, and you will not be able to predict anything. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And so, you prophets, your time of success is almost over. You will soon be in darkness. You will have no visions from God and you will not be able to predict the future.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice that these translations use the pronoun “you” for all of verse 6. In Hebrew, 6a–b use the pronoun “you” but 6c–d use “they/them.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"></p></div>",

Regardless of the quote marks, Micah’s message came to him from the LORD.

It can refer to the mouth, mustache, or beard. The phrase <em>cover their mouths</em> means “they put the palm of their hand over their mouth and lower face to hide it.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a <u>symbolic gesture</u>. Jewish people covered their mouths like this to show that they were very sad or ashamed. (See Ezekiel 24:17; Leviticus 13:45.)</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate this symbolic gesture:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><u>Keep the gesture</u>.

In 6a–b, he spoke <u>to</u> the evil prophets. In 6c–d and verse 7, Micah again spoke <u>about</u> these prophets. In Hebrew poetry, it is common to switch from “they” to “you,” or switch from “you” to “they” like this. But in some languages, this may be confusing.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some ways that you can translate the pronouns in this passage:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Translate all the pronouns as they are in Hebrew.

He spoke to the leaders of the Jews and to the prophets. He rebuked (scolded) them for their wicked deeds. He also told them that God would punish the nation because of them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will divide this section into three paragraphs:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>In 3:1–4, Micah rebuked the <u>judicial leaders</u>.</p></li><li><p>In 3:5–8, Micah rebuked the <u>wicked prophets</u>.</p></li><li><p>In 3:9–12, Micah rebuked <u>all the leaders</u>: judges, prophets, and priests.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">In each paragraph, Micah used the word “justice” (3:1, 8, 9). In each paragraph, he first rebuked the leaders for their evil deeds. Then he described what would happen as a result of their wickedness. Some versions begin a new paragraph at verse 4 or verse 8. It is recommended that you follow the paragraphs used in the Notes.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples of section headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Micah Denounces Israel’s Leaders (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Leaders and Prophets Rebuked (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Israel’s Sinful Leaders—Rulers, Prophets, and Priests (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Wicked Rulers and Prophets (NRSV)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1033003005\" data-endVerseId=\"1033003008\"><h3>Paragraph 3:5–8</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, Micah rebuked the wicked prophets. He first described the way in which they misled the people (3:5). He then described their future punishment by God (3:6–7). He concluded by contrasting his own status as a true prophet (3:8).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Micah began this paragraph with the phrase “Thus says the LORD.” This phrase indicates that his message came from the LORD. But it is not clear which verses are a direct quote of the LORD’s words. In the examples below, the verse parts may differ, depending on the version. Here are the main interpretations:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><u>All of verses 5–8 are Micah’s words</u>. These verses are the message that he received from the LORD. The lack of quotation marks indicates that he did not quote the LORD’s words directly.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Interpretation (1) is supported by WBC 1984 (pages 32–33).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5a</sup>Thus says the Lord concerning the prophets who lead my people astray;…<sup>6a</sup>Therefore it will be night for you…<sup>7a</sup>The seers will be ashamed…<sup>8a</sup>On the other hand I am filled with power… (NASB) <em>(ESV, GW, KJV, NAB, NASB, NJB, NRSV, REB)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NJPS does not use any quote marks in 3:5–8.

The quote is marked with quotation marks. <u>Verse 8 is Micah’s words</u>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Interpretation (2) is supported by Hillers (page 44).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5a</sup>This is what the Lord says: <sup>5b</sup>“As for the prophets who lead my people astray…. <sup>7b</sup>They will all cover their faces because there is no answer from God.” <sup>8a</sup>But as for me… (NIV) <em>(BSB, NCV, NET, NIV, NLT)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NET includes 3:8 in the same paragraph as 3:5–7.

The Notes have divided them into two lines to make it easier to understand the relationship between the phrases, especially in the Display.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In these lines, Micah listed four qualifications (superscripts <sup>1–4</sup>) that contrasted him with the wicked prophets:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>8a</sup>As for me, however, I am <sup>1</sup>filled with power <sup>2</sup>by the Spirit of the LORD,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>8b</sup> <sup>3</sup>with justice <sup>4</sup>and courage,</p></blockquote><h4>3:8a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:8a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>As for me, however, I am filled with power by the Spirit of the LORD,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But as for me, I have great/much power that the Spirit of Yahweh has given me.</p></li><li><p>But my situation/status is different.

Here are some other ways to express this strong contrast:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>On the other hand (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Not so with me (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I am filled with power:</strong> Micah used the word <em>filled</em> in a <u>figurative</u> sense. To be <em>filled with power</em> means to have special power, to be very powerful. This verb phrase is also passive.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be necessary to use an active verb and to make explicit the agent (the one who does the action). Here the implied agent is <u>the LORD</u>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Waltke 2007 (page 167). A&amp;F (page 376) say specifically that “the understood agent is Yahweh. The spirit should not be identified as the agent of the filling (so NICOT).”</span></span> Some versions make the agent explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But <u>the Lord</u> has filled me with power and with his Spirit. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>filled with power:</strong> This is the first qualification that Micah listed. Here the word <em>power</em> refers primarily to his ability as a prophet to proclaim the message that the LORD gave him. This ability requires inner, moral strength. It can also refer to physical strength and energy, but physical power is not the primary meaning.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NAC (pages 78–79) identifies the focus of Micah’s empowerment as his prophet ministry. UBS (pages 177–178) says that “power” “implies not only physical strength but moral strength as well.” Mays (page 85) says that it’s “the power to persevere in the face of opposition and discouragement.” Waltke 2007 (page 157) says “it could be translated by ‘energy, vigor.’”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by the Spirit of the LORD:</strong> This is the second qualification that Micah listed. Versions and commentaries differ as to whether the word <em>Spirit</em> should be spelled with a capital letter. They also differ as to the connection of <em>Spirit</em> or “spirit” with the other qualifications. The Notes will first discuss the spelling of <em>Spirit</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The word <em>Spirit</em> should be spelled with a <u>capital letter</u>. When it is spelled this way, it refers to the Holy Spirit, even though the word “Holy” is not explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But as for me, I am filled with power, with the <u>Spirit</u> of the Lord (NIV) <em>(BSB, CEV, ESV, GW, NABRE, NASB NCV, NET, NIV, NLT, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The word “spirit” should be spelled with a <u>small letter</u>. When it is spelled this way, it may refer to the power of the LORD or to a special kind of energy.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>UBS (pages 177–178) says that to be filled with the spirit means to be able to see things from the LORD’s point of view of the way he expects people to live. NICOT (page 314) describes “spirit” as the “extension of Yahweh’s personality…by which his will was communicated to the prophets.” Waltke 2007 (page 166) identifies it as the energy of I AM.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Not so with me, I am full of strength (full of Yahweh’s spirit) (NJB) <em>(KJV, NAB, NJB, NJPS, NRSV, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions and commentaries.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Commentaries that support interpretation (1) include EBC, KD, CBC, ABC, JFB, Barnes, TOTC, and Waltke 1993. Commentaries that support interpretation (2) include A&amp;F, NICOT, WBC, UBS, and Waltke 2007.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Notes will now discuss the connection of <em>Spirit</em> or “spirit” with the other qualifications:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The phrase “with the Spirit/spirit of the LORD” is in a separate category. It is the Spirit/spirit of the LORD that enabled Micah to be filled with the other three qualifications. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But I, I am filled with strength by the spirit of the Lord, and with judgment and courage, (NJPS) <em>(BSB, KJV, NET, NJPS)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The phrase “with the Spirit/spirit of the LORD” is one of four equal qualifications. Micah has been filled with or given each of them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But as for me, I am filled with power, with the Spirit of the Lord, and with justice and might, (NIV) <em>(CEV, ESV, NAB, NCV, NIV, NRSV, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The phrase “with the Spirit/spirit of the LORD” further identifies the word “power.” Micah has also been filled with the other two qualifications. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But as for me, I am filled with power—with the Spirit of the Lord. I am filled with justice and strength (NLT) <em>(GW, NASB, NJB, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) or (2) and that you capitalize the word that you use for <em>Spirit</em>. The Notes will follow interpretation (1). More versions follow interpretation (2), but the Notes will follow interpretation (1). It is more logical to think that Micah’s qualifications as a prophet were all dependent in some way on his being filled with the Spirit of the LORD.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Commentaries that support the idea of the LORD’s Spirit/spirit being on a different level from the other qualifications or gifts include NAC, Barnes, Mays, A&amp;F, TOTC, and Waltke 1993. Waltke 1993 (page 667) says: “Power, justice, and valor are the signs of the Spirit’s presence in Micah.” A&amp;F (page 377) says: “The attributes of power, judgment and might come from (or with) the spirit of Yahweh.”</span></span></p><h4>3:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>with justice and courage,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Because of him, I know what deeds are just/fair. I have great courage</p></li><li><p>He has caused me to know <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the true meaning of</span> justice, and he has made me very brave.</p></li><li><p>He has told me what is right/fair, and I am not afraid <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to speak his message</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with justice:</strong> This is the third qualification that Micah listed. The word <em>justice</em> is the same word that Micah used in 3:1b. (See the note there on “know justice.”) When Micah said that he was “filled…with justice,” he meant that the <u>Spirit of the LORD caused him to thoroughly understand what actions were just, right, and fair</u>. Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am full…of the sense of right (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He gave me great ability to know what deeds are just and fair.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and courage:</strong> This is the fourth qualification that Micah listed. When Micah said that he was “filled…with courage,” he meant that the <u>Spirit of the LORD caused him to have great courage and bravery</u> to announce his message. Even if people opposed Micah, he was <u>not afraid</u> to proclaim the message that the Spirit of the LORD had made known to him. Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and might (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have also been given real boldness</p></blockquote><h4>3:8c–d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:8c–d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(combined/reordered)</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This is the kind of person that Yahweh has caused me to become</span> in order that I will be able to make known to the entire nation of Israel that they have sinned and rebelled against Yahweh.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">These two lines are parallel. Notice the parts that are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>8c</sup>to declare to <u>Jacob</u> <strong>his transgression</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>8d</sup>and to <u>Israel</u> <strong>his sin</strong>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">There is an ellipsis (a deliberately omitted phrase) in 3:8d. In some languages, it may be necessary to supply the missing verb from 3:8c. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>8d</sup>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to declare</span> to <u>Israel</u> <strong>his sin</strong>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The names “Jacob” and “Israel” refer here to the same people. The words “transgression” and “sin” are similar in meaning. In 1:5a–b, Micah used these same four words. See the notes there.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In 3:8c–d, Micah told the purpose for the qualifications that the LORD had given him. The purpose was <u>so that</u> he would be able to announce his message. Here is another way to translate these lines:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This enables me to confront Jacob with its rebellion, and Israel with its sin. (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to declare:</strong> In Hebrew, this verb means “to announce, to report, to tell publicly.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Jacob…Israel:</strong> Micah used the names <em>Jacob</em> and <em>Israel</em> together in 1:5a–b; 2:12a–b, and 3:1a. The name <em>Jacob</em> here represents all the people who are <u>descendants of Jacob</u>. The name <em>Israel</em> represents the <u>people/nation of Israel</u>. Together, these parallel names refer to all the Jews.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>transgression…sin:</strong> The word <em>transgression</em> refers to disobedience of the law or rebellion against the LORD. The word <em>sin</em> is a general word.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be clearer to translate the words <em>transgression</em> and <em>sin</em> as verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>…to tell the descendants of Jacob that they have transgressed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his laws</span>, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in other words,</span> to tell the people of Israel that they have sinned.</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:8c–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to combine and/or reorder the parallel parts in these lines.

He spoke to the leaders of the Jews and to the prophets. He rebuked (scolded) them for their wicked deeds. He also told them that God would punish the nation because of them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will divide this section into three paragraphs:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>In 3:1–4, Micah rebuked the <u>judicial leaders</u>.</p></li><li><p>In 3:5–8, Micah rebuked the <u>wicked prophets</u>.</p></li><li><p>In 3:9–12, Micah rebuked <u>all the leaders</u>: judges, prophets, and priests.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">In each paragraph, Micah used the word “justice” (3:1, 8, 9). In each paragraph, he first rebuked the leaders for their evil deeds. Then he described what would happen as a result of their wickedness. Some versions begin a new paragraph at verse 4 or verse 8. It is recommended that you follow the paragraphs used in the Notes.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples of section headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Micah Denounces Israel’s Leaders (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Leaders and Prophets Rebuked (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Israel’s Sinful Leaders—Rulers, Prophets, and Priests (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Wicked Rulers and Prophets (NRSV)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1033003009\" data-endVerseId=\"1033003012\"><h3>Paragraph 3:9–12</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">This paragraph is similar to 3:1–4. Micah again spoke to the leaders of Israel. He specifically included the judicial leaders (verse 9a–b, 11a), priests (verse 11b), and prophets (verse 11c). He told them to listen (verse 9a). He then accused them of behaving wickedly and described the sins of each group (verses 9b–11). Finally, he told them that God would destroy Jerusalem, including the area where the temple was located (verse 12).</p></div><h4>3:9a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:9a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Now hear this, O leaders of the house of Jacob and rulers of the house of Israel,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Listen to this, you<sup>(plur)</sup> leaders of the descendants of Jacob! <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Listen, you</span> rulers of the people of Israel!</p></li><li><p>¶ Pay attention to what I will say, you rulers of Jacob<span data-bnType=\"implied\">’s descendants</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who serve as</span> judges for the nation of Israel.</p></li><li><p>(combined/reordered)</p></li><li><p>¶ Listen to this <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that I will say/announce</span>, you who rule/lead the Jewish people!</p></li><li><p>¶ You who are leaders/rulers over the people/nation of Israel, listen to what I am going to tell you!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>9a</sup>Now hear this, O <u>leaders</u> of <strong>the house of Jacob</strong> and <u>rulers</u> of <strong>the house of Israel</strong>,</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Now hear this:</strong> Micah told the leaders to listen to what he said. The word <em>this</em> probably refers forward to what Micah said in the rest of this paragraph (3:9b–12).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>O leaders of the house of Jacob and rulers of the house of Israel:</strong> The parallel words <em>leaders</em> and <em>rulers</em> both refer to the judicial leaders. The phrase <em>house of Jacob</em> means “descendants of Jacob.” The phrase <em>house of Israel</em> means “the nation/people of Israel.” Both phrases refer to the same group of people. See the notes on 3:1a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Verse 3:9a is similar to 3:1a. See the comparison below:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>3:1a Then I said: <u>hear</u> now, O <u>leaders</u> of Jacob, you <u>rulers</u> of the house of Israel.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>3:9a Now <u>hear</u> this, O <u>leaders</u> of the house of Jacob and <u>rulers</u> of the house of Israel,</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In Hebrew, the phrase “of Jacob” in 3:1a has the same meaning as “the house of Jacob” in 3:9a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions use different words or phrases in 3:1a and 3:9a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Listen (1a)…Hear (9a) (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>heads…rulers (1a), rulers…chiefs (9a) (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>of Jacob…of the house of Israel (1a), of the house of Jacob…of the house of Israel (9a) (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You may follow either approach (the same words/phrases or synonyms). Use what is natural in your language.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:9a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to combine and/or reorder some of the parallel parts in this line.

Micah said that these leaders <em>despise justice</em>. They detested ruling in an honest and fair way. They hated to make fair decisions.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>justice:</strong> Micah used this same word in 3:1b and 3:8b. See the Notes on 3:1b about <em>justice</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>pervert all that is right:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase is more literally “<span data-bnType=\"implied\">you who</span> make crooked everything that is straight.” Micah used the words “crooked” and “straight” in a <u>figurative</u> (moral) sense. Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You do not act in straight ways. You always act in crooked ways.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You always behave dishonestly, not honestly.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"></p>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and they <u>all</u> claim that the Lord is with them (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>lean upon the LORD:</strong> This phrase means to “trust in” or “depend on” the LORD.

He spoke to the leaders of the Jews and to the prophets. He rebuked (scolded) them for their wicked deeds. He also told them that God would punish the nation because of them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will divide this section into three paragraphs:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>In 3:1–4, Micah rebuked the <u>judicial leaders</u>.</p></li><li><p>In 3:5–8, Micah rebuked the <u>wicked prophets</u>.</p></li><li><p>In 3:9–12, Micah rebuked <u>all the leaders</u>: judges, prophets, and priests.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">In each paragraph, Micah used the word “justice” (3:1, 8, 9). In each paragraph, he first rebuked the leaders for their evil deeds. Then he described what would happen as a result of their wickedness. Some versions begin a new paragraph at verse 4 or verse 8. It is recommended that you follow the paragraphs used in the Notes.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples of section headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Micah Denounces Israel’s Leaders (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Leaders and Prophets Rebuked (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Israel’s Sinful Leaders—Rulers, Prophets, and Priests (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Wicked Rulers and Prophets (NRSV)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1033003009\" data-endVerseId=\"1033003012\"><h3>Paragraph 3:9–12</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">This paragraph is similar to 3:1–4. Micah again spoke to the leaders of Israel. He specifically included the judicial leaders (verse 9a–b, 11a), priests (verse 11b), and prophets (verse 11c). He told them to listen (verse 9a). He then accused them of behaving wickedly and described the sins of each group (verses 9b–11). Finally, he told them that God would destroy Jerusalem, including the area where the temple was located (verse 12).</p></div><h4>3:12</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In this verse, Micah again spoke <u>to</u> the leaders. He told them that because of their evil deeds, a terrible thing would happen. This verse is similar to 1:6. In that verse, the LORD said that <u>Samaria</u> (the capital of the northern kingdom) would be destroyed. Here in 3:12, Micah said that <u>Jerusalem</u> (the capital of the southern kingdom) would be destroyed, along with the temple.</p><h4>3:12a–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse is introduced by a phrase in 12a that connects the preceding verses (3:9–11) to three parallel lines that follow:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12a</sup>Therefore, because of you,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12b</sup> <u>Zion</u> <strong>will be plowed like a field</strong>,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12c</sup> <u>Jerusalem</u> <strong>will become a heap of rubble</strong>,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12d</sup>and <u>the temple mount</u> <strong>a wooded ridge</strong>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">There is an ellipsis (a deliberately omitted phrase) in 3:12d. In some languages, it may be necessary to supply the missing verb from 3:12c. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12d</sup>and <u>the temple mount</u> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">shall become</span> <strong>a wooded ridge</strong>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In each of the parallel lines (12b–12d), the parts in bold print describe what will happen to the underlined parts.</p><h4>3:12a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:12a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Therefore, because of you,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Therefore, because of your<sup>(plur)</sup> wicked deeds,</p></li><li><p>And so, because you have done those things,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Therefore, because of you:</strong> This phrase introduces the <u>result</u> of the sins of the leaders described in 3:9–11. Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>That is why, on account of you,…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And so, because of you,… (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Because of you,… (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This is what will happen because of your sins:</p></blockquote><h4>3:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Zion will be plowed like a field,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Zion will become like a field that people plow.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the future</span> the city of Zion <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will no longer be a city. It</span> will become farmland where people plow the ground <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and plant crops</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Zion will be plowed like a field:</strong> This verse part is a simile. It means that <em>Zion</em> will be plowed in the same way as a field is plowed. In the future, <em>Zion</em> will no longer be a city with buildings and houses. People will plow the ground to plant crops there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Zion:</strong> In 1:13 and 3:10, Micah used the name <em>Zion</em> as another name for Jerusalem. Here in 3:12b, it is probably also another name for Jerusalem.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Almost all commentaries say that in this verse, the names <em>Zion</em> and Jerusalem are synonymous, and the phrase “the temple mount” refers to the area in Jerusalem where the temple was located. See Waltke 2007 (pages 182–183) for a summary of “the three aspects of Jerusalem’s complex situation.” KD (page 318) disagrees. He says that “Zion is that portion of the city which contained the royal palace, and Jerusalem the rest of the city.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>plowed:</strong> Micah said that people will plow the ground where the city of Zion (Jerusalem) was. In languages that do not have a term for plowing, it may be possible to use a more <u>generic</u> term. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Zion will become like a field that people <u>farm</u>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>…like a field where people <u>plant crops</u>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be helpful to make explicit some information about Zion. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in the future Zion <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will no longer be a city</span>. It will become like a field that people plow.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If a simile here is not natural in your language, you may translate the meaning directly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Zion will become a ploughed field (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Jerusalem will be plowed under (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>field:</strong> In Hebrew, this word refers to <u>open land</u> in contrast to land that has a city or forest on it. Here it refers specifically to <u>farmland</u>, a field for growing crops.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The same Hebrew word is used in 1:6a (“open country”) and 2:2a (“fields”).</span></span></p><h4>3:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yes,</span> the city of Jerusalem will become piles of broken rocks, bricks, and other rubble/debris.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">People will destroy the city of</span> Jerusalem so that no walls or buildings remain,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble:</strong> Micah said that the city of <em>Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble</em>. It is implied that an enemy army will destroy the buildings and walls. Only <em>a heap of rubble</em> will be left.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a heap of rubble:</strong> In Hebrew, the phrase <em>a heap of rubble</em> is a single word. It refers to a pile of broken rocks, bricks, wood, and other debris/residue that is left after the buildings and walls of a city are destroyed. Micah used the same word in 1:6a (“heap”). Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>reduced to ruins (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a pile of ruins (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>left in ruins (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>3:12d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:12d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and the temple mount a wooded ridge.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The hill on which the temple now stands will be overgrown/covered with bushes and small trees.</p></li><li><p>and thickets/brush will grow on the hill where the temple is now located.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and the temple mount:</strong> In Hebrew, this is literally “the mountain/hill of the house.” The word “house” here refers to the <em>temple</em>, the house of the LORD. The temple was on top of a hill in Jerusalem. Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the mountain of the house (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the mountain where the temple now stands (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the hill on which the Temple stands (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a wooded ridge:</strong> Micah said that the hill on which the temple stood will become a <em>wooded ridge</em>. This implies that the temple will first be <u>destroyed</u>. It will no longer exist.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>a wooded ridge</em> refers to a hilltop that has small trees and bushes growing on it.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT (#888a) defines the Hebrew word as “forest, woods, thicket.” It comments about Micah 3:12 that “the mountain of the temple will become high places of a forest, i.e. thick and overgrown.” ABC (page 1079) says: the hill on which it stood will be overgrown with weeds.” NICOT (page 316) calls it “a scrub-covered hill.” KD (page 318) says: “the ground upon which the city stood will be partly used as a ploughed field, and partly overgrown with bushes.”</span></span> It probably does not refer to a forest with large trees.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate 3:12d in English:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and the temple mount will become a hill overgrown with brush (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and the hill on which the Temple stands will be covered with bushes (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>A thicket will grow on the heights where the Temple now stands. (NLT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment (1) on 3:12</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The phrase “Therefore because of you” gives the <u>reason</u> that these terrible things will happen to Jerusalem. In some languages, it may be clearer to put this phrase at the end of the verse. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So in the future, Zion will become farmland that people plow. People will destroy Jerusalem so that it becomes a heap of ruins. Thickets will grow on the hill where the temple used to be. <u>All this will happen because of your wicked deeds</u>.</p></blockquote><h5><strong>General Comment (2) on 3:12</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Verse 12c talks about the <u>buildings</u> and other structures in Jerusalem: they will become piles of rubble. Verse parts 12b and 12d talk about the <u>land</u> in Jerusalem: some will become farmland, and shrubs will grow on the temple hill. If it is clearer in your language, you can rearrange the verse parts so that 12b and 12d are together. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12a</sup>And so, because of your wicked deeds, <sup>12c</sup>people will destroy Jerusalem so that it becomes a pile of rubble. <sup>12b</sup>Zion will become farmland that people plow, <sup>12d</sup>and bushes will grow on the hill where the temple used to be.</p></blockquote></div>",

In some languages, it may be better to combine these two verse parts. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The LORD will raise up the mountain where his temple is so that it becomes higher than all the other hills and mountains.

The first option is probably simpler.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">With the second option, the implied agent is the LORD. It is he who will establish the temple mountain as the highest mountain. You can make the agent explicit if it is necessary in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In the future, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the LORD</span> will cause the mountain where his temple is located to become the highest mountain.</p></blockquote><h4>4:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>it will be raised above the hills,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It will become higher than other hills.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He/Yahweh</span> will raise it up so it becomes taller than <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all the other mountains and</span> hills.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it will be raised above the hills:</strong> As with the parallel line 4:1b, English versions translate the verb <em>will be raised above</em> in one of two ways. You may follow either option. If you chose the simpler option in 4:1b, it will probably be better to choose the same option here. Use an intransitive verb such as “rise.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>rise higher than the hills (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>towering above other hills (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It will rise up until it is taller than all the other hills.</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:1b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The hill where the temple was located was not a very high hill. There were other hills and mountains near Jerusalem that were higher. But in these two verse parts, Micah said that in the future the temple mountain will become higher than other mountains and hills.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">So some versions and commentaries understand the words “higher/highest” to mean “higher/highest in importance, not in altitude.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NAC (pages 83–84) thinks that “Mount Zion and its temple will be elevated probably both physically and in prominence.” Waltke 2007 also acknowledges both aspects. But EBC (page 524) says: “Its greatness has nothing to do with its present physical features (it is, after all, a relatively small mountain), but rather with God’s choice of it as his place of earthly dwelling.” UBS (page 186) says that the statement in v.1 “undoubtedly has a spiritual significance.” JFB (page 691) says that “its elevation is to be not that of situation, but of moral dignity, as the seat of God’s universal empire.” ABC (page 1079) uses similar wording. KD (pages 309–310) says: “This exaltation is of course not a physical one…but a spiritual (ethical) elevation above all the mountains. This is obvious from v. 2, according to which Zion will tower above all the mountains, because the law of the Lord issues from it.”</span></span> The NCV (quoted above) is one example. Here are some other examples:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…the Temple of the Lord in Jerusalem will become the <u>most important place on earth</u>. (NLT96)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it will be <u>more prominent</u> than other hills (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…the mountain of the Lord’s temple will be established as <u>chief among the mountains</u> (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Versions and commentaries are divided as to whether the height of the mountain refers to physical altitude or importance as the center of the Lord’s rule. You may translate either way. If your readers understand your translation to refer to physical/literal altitude, it is suggested that you supply a footnote that gives the other meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In the future, the mountain of the LORD’s house will become higher than all other mountains and hills. [footnote: This may mean that the temple in Jerusalem will become the most important place on earth.]</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">If your translation clearly refers to importance, it is suggested that you supply a footnote that gives the other possible meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In the future, the mountain where the LORD’s temple is located will be more important than any other place on earth. [footnote: In Hebrew, this literally says: “…will be higher than all other mountains and hills.”]</p></blockquote></div><h4>4:1d–2a</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1d</sup>and the <u>peoples</u> <strong>will stream</strong> to it.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2a</sup>And <u>many nations</u> <strong>will come</strong> and say:</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The terms “peoples” and “many nations” refer to the same people.

These two lines are his own explanation. According to interpretation (2), Micah quotes the people throughout 4:2b–g.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most English versions. There is almost no difference in meaning between these two interpretations.</p><h4>4:2b–c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:2b–c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(combined/reordered)</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“Come<sup>(plur)</sup> with us<sup>(excl)</sup> to the house/temple that is on Yahweh’s mountain <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Jerusalem</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">These two lines are parallel.

In some languages, it may be necessary to supply the missing verb from 4:2b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2c</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">let us go up</span> <u>to the house</u> <strong>of the God of Jacob</strong>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In these two parallel lines (2b–c), the second line is <u>more specific</u> than the first. The people wanted to go “to the mountain of the LORD.” Specifically, they wanted to go “to the house” (temple) that was on that mountain.</p><h4>4:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“Come<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with us</span><sup>(excl)</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">!</span> Let us<sup>(incl)</sup> go to Yahweh’s mountain.</p></li><li><p>“Let us<sup>(incl)</sup> go to the mountain <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Jerusalem</span> that Yahweh has chosen.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD:</strong> The people from other nations who will say these words urged or invited other people to go with them to Jerusalem.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The two verbs <em>Come</em> and <em>let us go up</em> refer to the same action. The first verb functions primarily to introduce the second verb and to add emphasis. It does not imply that the people should first come to a particular location and then set out on the journey to Jerusalem. Here are some other ways to translate these two verbs:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Let’s go to the mountain of the Lord (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We<sup>(excl)</sup> are going to the mountain where God’s house is. You<sup>(plur)</sup> come with us<sup>(excl)</sup>!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Hey! Let us<sup>(incl)</sup> go…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>go up to the mountain…:</strong> These people may have spoken about going <em>up</em> to Jerusalem because the main part of Jerusalem was on top of some hills, or perhaps they were intending to honor the city. If it is more natural in your language, you can translate this simply as “go,” as in the GW quoted above.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>of the LORD:</strong> This phrase has the same meaning as it does in the phrase “the mountain <u>of the house of the LORD</u>” in 4:1b.

That is the place where the Jewish people worship God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to the house of the God of Jacob:</strong> There are two main ways to translate the name <em>God of Jacob</em>:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use the name “Jacob.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the God of Jacob (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the God whom Jacob worshiped</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the name “Israel.” (Israel was another name for the man Jacob, and Jacob’s descendants were called the people of Israel or Israelites.) For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the God of Israel (NLT96)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Israel’s God (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the God whom the Israelite people worship</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">If you follow the second option, you may want to give the more literal wording in a footnote.

The Hebrew word used here is often translated “road.” God’s <em>ways</em> means “the ways/manner God wants people to live.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that he can teach us his commands (NET)</p></blockquote><h4>4:2e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:2e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that we may walk in His paths.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and we<sup>(incl)</sup> can <span data-bnType=\"implied\">then</span> obey them.”</p></li><li><p>and we will live/behave that way.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that we may walk in His paths:</strong> The phrase <em>His paths</em> is a synonym of the phrase “His ways.” The phrase <em>walk in His paths</em> is also an idiom. To <em>walk</em> in God’s <em>paths</em> means “to follow his commands” or “to live the way that God wants.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and we can live by his laws (NET)</p></blockquote><h4>4:2f–g</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:2f–g\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(combined/reordered)</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For it is from Zion, which is also named Jerusalem, that Yahweh will cause people to learn his words that he will teach them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In these two parallel verse parts, Micah explained the reason people will to go to Jerusalem. Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning. Notice also that the parallel parts occur in the form of a chiasm (opposite order) in the two lines:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2f</sup>For <u>the law</u> will go forth <strong>from Zion</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2g</sup>and <u>the word of the LORD</u> <strong>from Jerusalem</strong>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">There is an ellipsis (a deliberately omitted phrase) of the verb in 4:2g. In some languages, it may be necessary to supply the missing verb from 4:2f. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2g</sup>and <u>the word of the LORD</u> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">shall go forth</span> <strong>from Jerusalem</strong>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> This word introduces the <u>reason</u> that people will go to Jerusalem. In some languages, it may be more natural to leave the reason implied. For an example, see the NCV quoted below.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>from Zion…from Jerusalem:</strong> Here are two ways to translate these parallel names:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate the names separately. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2f</sup>For <u>Zion</u> will be the source of instruction;</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2g</sup>the Lord’s teachings will proceed from <u>Jerusalem</u>.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>3d</sup>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they shall beat</span> their <u>spears</u> into <strong>pruning hooks</strong>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In Hebrew, 4:3c begins with a conjunction that is often translated by “and.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>and</u> they shall beat their swords… (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Other translations (including the BSB) use a conjunction that often introduces the next action. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Then</u> they will hammer their swords… (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other ways to translate this conjunction:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Therefore</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As a result</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Many versions leave the Hebrew conjunction implied. Introduce the parallel results in 4:3c–d in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">“Swords” and “spears” are two kinds of <u>weapons</u> that represent any weapons that people used in warfare. “Plowshares” and “pruning hooks” are two kinds of <u>farm tools</u> that represent any farm tools.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">These verse parts refer to pounding iron to make tools. Blacksmiths usually do this kind of work. They heat (“smith/forge”) a piece of iron in a fire. Then they beat it with a hammer to change its shape. Micah said that in the future, people will beat their iron weapons to make farm tools.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>swords…spears:</strong> These words occur frequently in the Old Testament as well as the New Testament. Use the same terms in your language that you have used elsewhere.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>plowshares:</strong> A “plowshare”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some scholars think that the Hebrew word for <em>plowshares</em> can also mean “hoes.” The REB translates the word as “mattocks.” A mattock is a digging tool, similar to a hoe.</span></span> is a metal tip for a plow. Farmers in Israel made plows from wood. They put a metal tip on the part of the plow that dug up the dirt. Some versions make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>plow blades (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The GNT uses the more general word “plows,” which also occurs frequently in the Old Testament as well as the New Testament. You may choose to use the same term here. Another option is to use a term that refers to similar tools. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>hoes</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>digging tools</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>pruning hooks:</strong> The word <em>pruning hooks</em> refers to tools with curved iron blades similar to small sickles. The blade was attached to a wooden handle. Farmers used <em>pruning hooks</em> to cut off small branches from grape vines and trees. Here are some other ways to translate this term:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>pruning knives/shears (GNT/GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>hooks for trimming trees (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If it is awkward or unnatural to use one or more of the translation suggestions mentioned above, here are some other ideas:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use <u>borrowed words</u> from a language of wider communication and <u>provide pictures</u> of each item.</p></li><li><p>Use <u>general terms</u>.

If you have already translated Isaiah, you will want to translate these verses in a similar way.</p></div><h4>4:5a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 4:1–4, Micah spoke about the future. But here in 4:5, he spoke about the situation in his own time. Notice the parallel lines that contrast in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5a</sup>Though <u>each of the peoples may walk</u> <strong>in the name of his god</strong>,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5b</sup>yet <u>we will walk</u> <strong>in the name of the LORD our God</strong> forever and ever.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Though…yet…:</strong> There is a Hebrew conjunction at the beginning of this verse that introduces a reason for the promise of a peaceful life in 4:4.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>EBC (page 526). According to KD (page 311), “If, therefore, Israel rejoices for ever and ever in the strength of its God, the heathen nations cannot disturb the peace which He will create for Israel and all who accept His word. In this way is the promise in vv. 3 and 4 explained in v. 5.”</span></span> This conjunction is often translated as “for” (see NRSV). But 4:5 also makes a clear contrast between the nations who still worship their own gods (<em>Though</em>) and the Jews who will worship the true God forever (<em>yet</em>). There are several ways to express this combination of reason and contrast:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use explicit conjunctions such as “for” and “but” to introduce both the reason and the contrast. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5a</sup> <u>For</u> all the peoples walk, each in the name of its god,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5b</sup> <u>but</u> we will walk in the name of the Lord our God forever and ever. (NRSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Leave the reason implied, but use an explicit conjunction to express the contrast, as the BSB does. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5a</sup>All other nations may follow their own gods,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5b</sup> <u>but</u> we will follow the Lord our God forever and ever. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5a</sup> <u>Though</u> all the peoples walk each in the name of his god,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5b</sup>as for us, we will walk in the name of the Lord our God forever and ever. (NASB) <em>Notice that the NASB adds to the contrast by using the phrase “as for us.”</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Leave both the reason and the contrast implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5a</sup>All the nations may walk in the name of their gods;</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5b</sup>we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever. (NIV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>4:5a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:5a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Though each of the peoples may walk in the name of his god,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For all the people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of other nations</span> follow their own god/gods,</p></li><li><p>Even though all <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other</span> people obey and worship their own gods/idols,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>each of the peoples may walk in the name of his god:</strong> In Hebrew, the words “each…his” are singular. They imply that each of the other nations worships its own god. Some versions use plural pronouns here, because many of the other nations worshiped more than one false god or idol. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Other peoples may be loyal to <u>their</u> own <u>deities</u> (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Though the nations around us follow <u>their idols</u> (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>All the nations live by the names of <u>their gods</u> (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also the NCV and NIV (quoted above in 4:5a–b).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">You may use either singular or plural forms in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>walk in the name of his god:</strong> This phrase is a figure of speech. It means to worship a particular god in a way that is consistent with that god’s requirements and attributes. The REB “be loyal to” and NLT “follow” (quoted above) are two ways to express this idea.</p><h4>4:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>yet we will walk in the name of the LORD our God forever and ever.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as for us Jewish/Israelite people,</span> we<sup>(incl)</sup> will indeed continue to follow Yahweh our God forever.</p></li><li><p>we<sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jews</span> will always worship and serve Yahweh our God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with the strength that comes from him</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we:</strong> The pronoun <em>we</em> here is emphatic. If your language distinguishes between inclusive and exclusive pronouns, you should probably use the <u>inclusive</u> form here. Micah assumed that he and his audience will all worship the true God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will walk in the name of the LORD our God forever and ever:</strong> To <em>walk in the name of the LORD…forever and ever</em> may imply that the Jewish people persevere in following the LORD by using the strength that is one of his attributes.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to KD (page 311), walking in the name of God means “walking in the strength of God, in which the nature of this God is displayed.” EBC (page 526) says: To “walk in the name” is to enjoy the strength expressed in God’s attributes. NAC (pages 87–88) also mentions “walk in the strength of” as a possible meaning.</span></span> If it is appropriate to make this implication explicit in your translation or to mention it in a footnote, you may do so.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">You may decide to leave the figurative expression <em>name of</em> implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we will follow the Lord our God forever (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>forever and ever:</strong> This phrase is an emphatic way to say “forever.” Some languages may have a way to emphasize the word “forever.” Otherwise, you may follow the example of versions such as the NET (quoted above).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"></p>",

But the NJPS and NAB translate it as the name of a place: “O Migdal-eder” (NJPS), “O Magdal-eder” (NAB). (See also the footnotes in the NASB and NET.) At the time Jacob lived, there was a place near Bethlehem that had the name Migdal-eder (see Genesis 35:19–21). But in Micah 4:8, Micah spoke to Jerusalem, not Bethlehem. It is recommended that you translate the meaning of this Hebrew phrase rather than translating it as a proper name.</span></span> A <em>watchtower</em> is a tall building. A shepherd could stand on top of a tower to watch his <em>flock</em> of sheep or goats. In this metaphor, Jerusalem was compared to this kind of tower. The word <em>flock</em> stands for the <u>people</u> who lived in and near Jerusalem.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In this metaphor, there are several points of similarity:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Jerusalem was like a tower, because from Jerusalem <u>God watched over and protected his people</u>.</p></li><li><p>Jerusalem was like a tower, because <u>the city was strong and secure</u>. People who lived in it were safe from their enemies.</p></li><li><p>Jerusalem was like a tower, because from Jerusalem <u>the king and other leaders of Israel watched over their people</u> to protect them.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">You should translate in a way that any of these points of comparison can be understood. All three are compatible with Micah’s message.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate this metaphor:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the metaphor. Supply a footnote if you feel it will be helpful to your readers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And you, watchtower of the flocks (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Footnote in the NCV: [watchtower…flocks] This probably means a part of Jerusalem. The leaders would be like shepherds in a tower watching their sheep.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Change the metaphor to a simile. Make one or more of the points of comparison explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And you, Jerusalem, where God, like a shepherd from his lookout tower, watches over his people… (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without using a figure of speech. For example: <em>And you, O people of Jerusalem, will be safe inside your strong city.</em></p></li></ul><h4>4:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>O stronghold of the Daughter of Zion—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You</span><sup>(sing)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">are like</span> a fortress for the people who live in Zion.</p></li><li><p>Jerusalem is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> the fortress <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that was built</span> on Zion Hill <span data-bnType=\"implied\">long ago</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>O stronghold of the Daughter of Zion:</strong> In this second metaphor, the word <em>stronghold</em> means “fort” or “fortress.” People made a fortress by building a wall around the top part of a hill. Inside this wall, they could defend themselves from their enemies. Here are some other ways to translate this word:<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In Hebrew, the word for “hill” is <em>ʿopel</em>. The NJB translates it as the name of a place “Ophel” within the city of Jerusalem (see 2 Chronicles 27:3; 33:14). But here in Micah 4:8, it is better to translate the <u>meaning</u> of this word, not translate it as a name.</span></span></p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>fortress (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>citadel (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Daughter of Zion:</strong> This phrase is a poetic way to refer to the people who live in Jerusalem.

At that time, Israel was a strong nation. Micah was predicting that Jerusalem would again become the capital city of a strong nation, like it was in the time of David and Solomon.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate the clause “the former dominion will be restored”:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The former monarchy shall return (NJPS)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>your former sovereignty will return (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>your former government will come back to you (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to you will come the kingdom as in the past (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>your royal might and power will come back to you again (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to you:</strong> The pronoun <em>you</em> is emphatic.

Both phrases refer to the <u>people</u> of Jerusalem.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some scholars think that the phrase <em>Daughter of Jerusalem</em> means that God loved that city and the people in it.

If a separate paragraph heading will be helpful for your readers, here are some possible headings for each paragraph.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>9–10</sup>Why the Israelites Must Go to Babylon (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>9–10</sup>Current suffering and captivity, but future rescue</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>11–13</sup>Her Enemies to Be Crushed on the Threshing-Floor (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>11–13</sup>Jerusalem will completely destroy its enemies</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1033004009\" data-endVerseId=\"1033004010\"><h3>Paragraph 4:9–10</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, Micah told the people of Jerusalem what would happen in the future. Enemies would capture Jerusalem and take away the people as captives to Babylon. The king, who was their counselor, would be unable to help them (4:9a–4:10e). After that, God would rescue his people (4:10f–g).</p></div><h4>4:9a–d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:9a–d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(combined/reordered)</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Why do you<sup>(plur)</sup> inhabitants of Jerusalem cry out loudly and writhe like a woman who is suffering pain from giving birth to a child? Are you afraid because you have no wise king to rule you?</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In this verse, Micah prophesied that the people of Jerusalem would cry in fear, because their counselor, the king, would be unable to help them. In the BSB, Micah’s prophecy consists of three rhetorical questions (9a, 9b, and 9c–d):</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>9a</sup>Why do you now cry aloud?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>9b</sup>Is there no king among you?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>9c</sup>Has your counselor perished</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>9d</sup>so that anguish grips you like a woman in labor?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The last two questions (9b and 9c–d) suggest an answer to the first question: The people will cry aloud, because the king, who is their counselor, cannot help them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Micah may have used these rhetorical questions for more than one purpose: to get the people’s attention, to make them aware of what they were doing, to show sarcasm or to give rebuke. As with other rhetorical questions, these questions may be translated with another rhetorical question or with a statement.</p><h4>4:9a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:9a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Why do you now cry aloud?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Listen now to my words, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">O city of Jerusalem</span>: Why are you<sup>(sing)</sup> crying so loudly?</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I ask you people of Jerusalem</span>: What is the reason that you<sup>(plur)</sup> are shouting loudly <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in fear</span>?</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Why do you now cry aloud?:</strong> Here are some ways to translate this rhetorical question:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">OK</span> now, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">let me ask you this:</span> Why are you crying so loudly?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">O people! Think about the reason that</span> you are crying loudly.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you:</strong> In Hebrew, the pronoun here is feminine <u>singular</u>. It refers to the phrase “Daughter of Zion” in 4:10a. But that phrase is a figure of speech for the people who live in Jerusalem. So in many languages it may be clearer to translate <em>you</em> using a <u>plural</u> form.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>now:</strong> This word refers to a future time, not to the present. Some versions do not translate this word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Why do you cry out so loudly? (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The CEV also omits this word. It addresses Jerusalem directly to introduce the rhetorical question:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Jerusalem, why are you crying? (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>cry aloud:</strong> Some versions make explicit a reason why the people were shouting. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But why are you now screaming <u>in terror</u>? (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Why are you now crying out <u>in distress</u>? (REB)</p></blockquote><h4>4:9b–c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:9b–c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(combined/reordered)</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Does this city have no king who can give good advice?</p></li><li><p>Do you<sup>(plur)</sup> not have a king in your city who can counsel/advise you?</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Is there no king among you? Has your counselor perished:</strong> There are two main interpretation issues in these two rhetorical questions. The first issue is whether the second question refers to the king or to a different counselor or counselors:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The second question refers to the king. He was considered the counselor or adviser for the nation.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In Hebrew, the word for “counselor” is singular. The interpretation of the counselor being the same person as the king is supported by NICOT, EBC, NAC, Hillers, KD, Mays, and WBC. Pusey, TOTC, Waltke 1993, and Waltke 2007 understand these two titles to refer to the LORD himself rather than to an earthly king/counselor. See Waltke 2007 (pages 238–239) for three arguments in favor of his position. No English version follows this interpretation. For three arguments that support king/counselor as opposed to King/Counselor, see NAC (pages 90–91).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Has your king disappeared? Has your wise leader been destroyed? (NET) <em>(ESV, GW, KJV, NAB, NASB, NCV, BSB, NET, NIV, NJB, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The second question refers to various advisers who counseled the people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Commentaries that support multiple advisers include: UBS, JFB, and ABC.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Have you no king to lead you? Have your wise people all died? (NLT) <em>(CEV, NLT, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The second question refers to an adviser who counseled the king.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>CBC (page 325) comments: “The counselor or adviser was usually a member of the royal cabinet or part of the council of elders who advised the king.” A&amp;F also support this interpretation. No English versions follow it.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Are the king and his adviser not able to help you?</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most English versions and commentaries.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The second interpretation issue involves the date of the prophecy’s fulfilment and whether the king was literally absent or simply unable to help his people:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Micah may have referred to the period after 586 B.C. After that date, King Zedekiah and many of the people were taken into exile in Babylon, so the king was literally absent.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Irrespective of the identity of the king/counselor(s), ABC, KD, EBC, A&amp;F, and NAC appear to support the literal absence of a king. JFB, UBS, and NICOT appear to favor the literal presence of a king.</span></span></p></li><li><p>Micah may have referred to the period after 701 B.C. but before 586 B.C. During that time, the Assyrians attacked some cities in Judah and besieged Jerusalem. The king was still there, but he was not able to help the people or defeat their enemies.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">No versions clearly support interpretation (2). Some versions listed in the previous interpretation issue appear to support interpretation (1). They speak of the king as having disappeared, being gone, or being destroyed. But Micah would have asked similar questions if he were speaking sarcastically. The commentaries are divided.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to this interpretation, Micah predicted what happened in 586 B.C. The Babylonian army captured King Zedekiah and took him away as a prisoner to Babylon. See 2 Kings 25:1–7.</span></span> It is recommended that you translate so that either interpretation can be understood.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">You may want to supply a footnote that summarizes the historical context in which Micah prophesied. See the section in the Introduction entitled “Micah’s message and its relation to the cultural and religious background of Israel.”</p><h4>4:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Is there no king among you?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Is there no king who rules in you<sup>(sing)</sup>?</p></li><li><p>Is it because you<sup>(plur)</sup> no longer have a king?</p></li></ul></div><h4>4:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Has your counselor perished</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Has your<sup>(sing)</sup> counselor/adviser disappeared/died?</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Perhaps you are fearful because</span> you<sup>(plur)</sup> no longer anyone to advise you.</p></li></ul></div><h4>4:9d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:9d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that anguish grips you like a woman in labor?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Is that the reason you<sup>(sing)</sup> are groaning in pain like a woman who is having a baby?</p></li><li><p>Perhaps that is the reason you<sup>(plur)</sup> are shouting like a woman who has labor pains.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">are very afraid,</span> so you are behaving like a woman who is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in pain because she is</span> giving birth.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that anguish grips you like a woman in labor?:</strong> In the BSB, this verse part is a continuation of the third rhetorical question in 4:9c. Some other versions make it a separate question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Is this why pain grips you as if you were a woman in labor? (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Are you suffering like a woman in childbirth? (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This last question is related to the first question in 4:9a. There Micah asked the people why they were crying out. Here he uses a simile to compare their cries to a woman who is having severe labor pains. The reason they are crying in such a way is because of their fear and distress at the disasters that threaten Jerusalem, their king, and themselves.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions change this rhetorical question to a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Pain grips you like a woman in labor. (GW)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:9a–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be clearer or more natural to combine and/or reorder parts of these lines. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>9a</sup>Why do you cry out so loudly? <sup>9d</sup>Why are you suffering like a woman in labor? <sup>9b</sup>Is it because you have no king <sup>9c</sup>to counsel you?

One way to make this implication clear is to use a word such as “must.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for now you must leave the city (NIV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:10d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:10d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and camp in the open fields.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And then you<sup>(plur)</sup> will have to camp outside in the fields/countryside.</p></li><li><p>Then you will have to stay outside in open fields.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and camp in the open fields:</strong> When the Babylonian army destroyed Jerusalem, they forced many of the Jews to move to lands close to Babylon. The trip to Babylon took many days. On that long trip, the Jews camped or slept in fields.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>open fields:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase is a word that refers to land outside a city. It can be farm land, or it can be prairie. (See also 1:6; 2:2; 2:4; and 3:12, where the same Hebrew word is used.)</p><h4>4:10e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:10e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>You will go to Babylon;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You<sup>(plur)</sup> must go to Babylon.</p></li><li><p>You will go <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as exiles/prisoners</span> to the city of Babylon.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You will go to Babylon:</strong> Micah predicted that the people of Jerusalem would go to Babylon. It is implied that the people would be forced to go there as captives. Here are some other ways to make this implied meaning clear:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to Babylon you must go (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You will soon be sent in exile to distant Babylon. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Babylon:</strong> This is the name of a city.</p><h4>4:10f–g</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In contrast to the <u>bad news</u> in 4:10c–e, Micah predicted here that God would rescue them and bring them back again to their homeland. This was <u>good news</u>. Some versions use the conjunction “but” at the beginning of 4:10f to show this contrast. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10e</sup>You will go to Babylon, <sup>10f</sup><u>but</u> there you will be rescued. (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the verse parts in these parallel lines that are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10f</sup> <u>there</u> <strong>you will be rescued</strong>;</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10g</sup> <u>there</u> <strong>the LORD will redeem you</strong>…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">These lines refer to the <u>same event</u>.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>there…there:</strong> The word <em>there</em> in 10f and 10g refers to <u>Babylon</u>. These two words are emphatic. The Jews would go as captives to Babylon. It was <em>there</em> that the LORD would rescue them.</p><h4>4:10f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:10f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>there you will be rescued;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>There in Babylon you<sup>(plur)</sup> will be rescued.</p></li><li><p>From that place Yahweh will later deliver/save you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you will be rescued:</strong> This verb is passive.

Right <em>now</em>, the armies of enemy nations are preparing to attack the city. They have come together in a large group. The BSB and some other versions make this contrast explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>But now</u> many nations are massed against you (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>But now</u> many nations have come to fight against you (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you:</strong> In Hebrew, this pronoun is singular. It refers to <u>Zion</u> (Jerusalem), which is mentioned in the next verse part (4:11b). As in previous verses, you may decide to use a singular pronoun that refers to the city or a plural pronoun that refers to the people of the city.</p><h4>4:11b–c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:11b–c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(combined/reordered)</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They say, “Let’s dishonor Zion and gloat over it.” (GW)</p></li><li><p>They say, “We can hardly wait to see you disgraced.” (adapted from CEV)</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">These parallel lines both express the desire of the enemy troops who were preparing to attack the city.

For example, “Let them go” = “allow them to go.” But that is <u>not</u> the meaning here. When the enemy soldiers said these words, they meant that they <u>wanted</u> (<u>wished</u>, <u>hoped</u>) that these two things would happen.</p><h4>4:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>saying, “Let her be defiled,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They say, “May she/it be desecrated/defiled!</p></li><li><p>Those people/enemies say, “Come on, we<sup>(incl)</sup> will be happy to tear down <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the holy places in</span> Jerusalem/Zion!</p></li><li><p>They say, “We truly want to dishonor/disgrace your<sup>(plur)</sup> city.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>saying:</strong> This word introduces the quote in the next two parallel lines.

To defile something means “to <u>desecrate</u> it.” It means “to treat a holy place with <u>disrespect</u> by making it dirty or by destroying it.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Jerusalem was a holy place, because the temple was there. These people wanted to <u>defile</u> it with their presence and to <u>destroy</u> the city so it would no longer be holy. Here are some other ways to translate this desire:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May Zion be defiled/desecrated!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We<sup>(incl)</sup> want her to suffer outrage (adapted from REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We will dishonor/disgrace Zion/Jerusalem</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Let’s destroy Jerusalem.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>let our eyes gloat over Zion!” (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Link these two clauses in a natural way in your translation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a figure of speech in which the <em>eyes</em> represent the person. It means that these people wanted to look at Zion and gloat as they defiled/destroyed it. Their desire was similar to a man who is filled with malicious delight as he gazes at or thinks about a woman that he has raped.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>UBS (pages 200–201), JFB (page 692).</span></span> Here are some other ways to translate this line:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Let us gloat over Zion!” (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We will look at her and be glad we have defeated her.” (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We<sup>(incl)</sup> will be happy to see Zion/Jerusalem after we<sup>(incl)</sup> destroy it.</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:11b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to combine and/or reorder these parallel lines.

Most versions translate it with the word “that” or leave it implied.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>These nations don’t know <u>that</u> he is gathering them together to be beaten and trampled like sheaves of grain on a threshing floor. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He has gathered them like bundles of grain to the threshing floor. (NCV) <em>(CEV, ESV, GW, NCV, NET, NJB, NLT, NRSV, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>A few versions translate it as <em>for</em>. Micah used this word to explain what Jerusalem’s enemies do not understand. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>For</u> He has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor. (NASB) <em>(BSB, NASB, KJV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most English versions. Almost no commentaries discuss this issue. Only one commentary supports interpretation (2).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>KD (page 319) says that <em>ki</em> means “for:” “The sentence explains the assertion that they do not understand the counsel of the Lord.” Waltke 2007 (page 254) translates <em>ki</em> as “surely,” and identifies it as “an emphatic causal adverb.” WBC (page 41) does not comment, but his translation supports the NRSV and the strong majority of English versions.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>He has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor:</strong> The pronoun <em>He</em> refers to the LORD. The pronoun <em>them</em> refers to the soldiers of “many nations” who have gathered.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Micah used a simile here. He compared what the LORD did to what people do when they gather sheaves of grain to thresh them. There are at least two points of similarity:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>The LORD gathered the nations to fulfill his own plans. People gather sheaves of grain in order to thresh them.</p></li><li><p>The LORD intended to treat the nations harshly and punish or destroy them. People treat sheaves of grain harshly by causing animals to trample on them and pull hard, sharp threshing sledges over them.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>sheaves:</strong> The word <em>sheaves</em> refers to heads of ripe grain. The two most common grains in Israel were wheat and barley. The Jews harvested grain by cutting the stalk below the head of ripe grain. Then they gathered these stalks of grain and carried them to a threshing floor.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>threshing floor:</strong> A <em>threshing floor</em> is a flat smooth area of hard ground or rock. This is the place where people removed the grains from the stalks. People placed the harvested stalks of grain on the floor. Then they made cows walk on the stalks or pull a threshing sledge over the stalks. (A threshing sledge is a heavy piece of wood with bits of sharp metal or stones on the bottom.) This knocked the grains from the stalks. Then people separated the grain from the empty stalks by winnowing.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Winnowing involves tossing the threshed chaff and grain into the air on a windy day. In many cultures, a wide, fairly flat winnowing basket is used for this purpose. The wind then blows away the chaff, leaving the grain in the basket.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate this figure of speech:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate the simile without making any points of similarity explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He has gathered them as <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people gather</span> stalks of grain at a threshing floor.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Make one or more of the points of similarity explicit, as in the NLT (quoted above). Here is another example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…they have been gathered together <u>to be punished</u> in the same way that grain is brought in to be threshed (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Replace this simile with a comparison that people in your area will understand. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The LORD has gathered them together <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in order to destroy them</span>. It will be like when people gather snail shells and burn them and crush them to make lime.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate without a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The LORD plans to gather them together to utterly destroy them.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use an option that will be acceptable and well understood in your language area.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"></p>",

It begins a new prophecy that contrasts a current bad situation for the people of Jerusalem with a future good situation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5:1</sup>Marshal your troops now, city of troops, for a siege is laid against us. They will strike Israel’s ruler on the cheek with a rod. <sup>5:2a</sup><u>But</u> you, Bethlehem Ephrathah…out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel… (NIV11) <em>(CEV, ESV, KJV, NABRE, NASB, BSB, NIV11, NJB, NLT96, NRSV, REB, VOICE)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Micah 5:1 connects more closely to the verses before it. It is the last part of the preceding prophecy or else it returns to a theme from earlier verses. Micah tells the people to prepare to fight the enemy that has begun to attack them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>4:13a</sup>“Get up and beat them, people of Jerusalem. I will make you strong…” <sup>5:1a</sup>So, strong city, gather your soldiers together…. (NCV) <em>(NCV, NET)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Both the NCV and the NET indicate this connection by placing 5:1 in the same paragraph with the previous material and by inserting a new paragraph and section heading following 5:1. The NCV also indicates this connection with the word “So.”</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In this verse, Micah is probably the speaker. The pronoun “us” in 5:1b suggests that Micah here identified himself with the people of Jerusalem who were under siege.</p></div><h4>5:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Now, O daughter of troops, mobilize your troops;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Now gather your<sup>(sing)</sup> troops, city of soldiers,</p></li><li><p>¶ O fighting men of Jerusalem, now is the time to make ready your<sup>(plur)</sup> troops.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Now, O daughter of troops, mobilize your troops:</strong> There is a textual issue here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The MT has “now you will gather your troops (or cut yourself) O daughter of troops.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now muster yourselves in troops, daughter of troops (NASB) <em>(BSB, ESV, GW, KJV, NABRE, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, NJPS, NLT, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The LXX has “Now a daughter will be blocked with a blockage.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now you are walled around with a wall (NRSV) <em>(NAB, NJB, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1) along with most versions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are two main interpretations of the recommended textual option (MT):</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The clause means “now you will gather yourselves in a troop, O daughter of troops.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDB #1413 2. gather in troops, or bands.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now muster your troops, O daughter of troops (ESV) <em>(BSB, ESV, GW, KJV, NASB, NCV, NIV, NLT, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The clause means “now you will cut yourself, O daughter of troops.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDB #1413 1. cut oneself, as religious (heathen) practice.</span></span> It refers to the middle-eastern cultural practice of cutting oneself to demonstrate grief.

It also marks the start of a new prophecy.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>O daughter of troops:</strong> The Hebrew phrase <em>daughter of troops</em> is a term of address (vocative). Some versions have added the word <em>O</em> to indicate this. Use a vocative that is natural in your language when a person speaks to a group of people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>daughter of troops</em> is also a figure of speech. Its meaning is related to the word <em>troops</em>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The meaning of the figure of speech “daughter of…” depends on the meaning of the following word. For example, the expression “daughter of Zion,” refers to the people of Zion. See BDB #1323 sense 3 and the notes on this expression in 1:13b. Sometimes the following word may indicate a quality or characteristic of the people. For example, “daughter of a strange god” refers to people who worship idols. See BDB #1323 sense 5.</span></span> There are two main interpretations:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to troops of fighting men from Jerusalem.

Figures of speech that begin with the phrase <em>daughter of…</em> generally refer to a characteristic of the daughter rather than the daughter’s situation.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to JFB (page 692), the expression refers to Jerusalem’s many troops. According to Pusey (page 67), it refers to Jerusalem’s marauding, violent bands.

Here are some other ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a different idiom or figure of speech that conveys the right meaning in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>city of troops (NIV11)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning directly without using a figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jerusalem with your many fighting men<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some versions translate only part of the meaning.

Micah told the people of Jerusalem to gather themselves or their fighting men into one or more groups to defend the city from attacks by the enemy. Here is another way to translate this command:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>gather your soldiers together (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>5:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for a siege is laid against us!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because enemy soldiers have laid siege to us<sup>(incl)</sup>!</p></li><li><p>Your<sup>(plur)</sup> enemies have surrounded you<sup>(plur)</sup>!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a siege is laid against us:</strong> This clause describes a blockade of Jerusalem by enemy soldiers.

Introduce this contrast and emphasis in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Bethlehem Ephrathah:</strong> This refers to the birthplace of King David mentioned in Ruth 4:11 and 1 Sam. 17:12. Here it is used as a term of address (vocative) in which the LORD speaks to the town of Bethlehem in Judah. Some versions have added the word “O” to indicate this.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural to use indirect speech here. For an example, see the third meaning line for 5:2a in the Display.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>Ephrathah</em> may refer to the region where Bethlehem is located (NRSV “of Ephrathah” and REB “in Ephrathah”). The word may also refer to a clan/family name rather than a region (NJPS “Bethlehem of Ephrath” has a footnote: “The clan to which the Bethlehemites belonged”).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">TN will follow most versions, which translate the name of the town as <em>Bethlehem Ephrathah</em>. Here are some other ways to translate 5:2a:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But as for you, Bethlehem Ephrathah (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Lord says, “Bethlehem Ephrathah (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>5:2b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Verse 5:2c describes the unexpected result of 5:2b. People did not expect that a ruler over the nation of Israel would come from a small and insignificant town such as Bethlehem Ephrathah. Here are some ways to indicate the relationship between the true statement that Bethlehem was small and the unexpected result:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Begin 5:2b with a conjunction such as “though.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>though you are small… (NIV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Begin 5:2c with a conjunction such as “yet” or “but.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Yet, from you Israel’s future ruler will come for me.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who are one of the little…, from you shall come forth for me… (NRSV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">Express this relationship in a clear and natural way in your language.</p><h4>5:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who are small among the clans of Judah,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>although you<sup>(sing)</sup> are not highly regarded among the towns of Judah,</p></li><li><p>even though people do not regard you as important in Judah,</p></li><li><p>an insignificant place compared to others in Judah,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">The GNT has been used as the source line for 5:2b, because it follows the two recommended interpretations.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(GNT) you are one of the smallest towns in Judah:</strong> In Hebrew, this verse part is more literally “insignificant to be among the thousands of Judah.” There are at least two interpretation issues. The Notes will first consider the issue of the size or significance of Bethlehem Ephrathah:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Bethlehem Ephrathah is <u>small</u>. It is <u>unimportant compared to other cities/towns or clans</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Bethlehem Ephrathah, you are one of the smallest towns in the nation of Judah. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As for you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, seemingly insignificant among the clans of Judah (NET) <em>(CEV, KJV, NABRE, NET, NIV, NJB, NJPS, NLT, NRSV, REB, BSB, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Bethlehem Ephrathah is <u>too small/insignificant to be a city/clan</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You, Bethlehem Ephrathah, are too small to be included among Judah’s cities. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But you. O Bethlehem Ephrathah, who are too little to be among the clans of Judah (ESV) <em>(ESV, GW, NAB, NASB, NCV, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with a majority of versions.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to Waltke 2007 (page 268), the meaning “too small” requires the Hebrew word to have a comparative <em>min</em> affix. That affix is not present here.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>(GNT) towns:</strong> In Hebrew, this word is literally “thousands,” (as in the KJV). It often refers to large groups of people, such as groups of soldiers, clans or kinship/family groups.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Mounce #548: 3 <em>ʾelep</em> “by extension from ‘thousand,’ this refers to any large unit or group: (family) clan, (military) unit.” Also, DCH (p 300): 13.0.2 “clan—…tribal unit smaller than tribe, sometimes loosely equivalent to family…or tribe.” See also NIDOTTE vol. 2 (page 419), which discusses more than one sense of <em>ʾelep</em> as well as <em>ʾallup</em> “chief” in relation to a hierarchy of categories from nation and tribe down to family.</span></span> The NCV has “army groups from Judah.” Here, however, the word probably refers to non-military groups whose size would be appropriate for a small town or a clan or an extended group of relatives.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>ZIBBC (page 136) says that although the town and clan are not equivalent, one was often used as shorthand for the other.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Notes will now consider the issue of whether Bethlehem Ephrathah is a town or a clan. Versions from either of the two interpretations above will be listed:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Bethlehem Ephrathah is the <u>name of a town</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>are only a small village among all the people of Judah (NLT) <em>(CEV, GW,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The GW has been listed here, because its rendering “too small…among Judah’s cities” clearly implies a comparable unit such as a town or village.</span></span> NLT, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Bethlehem Ephrathah is the <u>name of a clan</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>small as you are among Judah’s clans (REB) <em>(BSB, ESV, NABRE, NASB, NET, NIV, NJB, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">You may follow either interpretation. TN will follow interpretation (1). Although more versions follow interpretation (2), there is significant commentary and lexicon support for (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A&amp;F (page 466) identifies this verse as the only one in which “the originally kin-oriented unit <em>ʾelep</em>” has been designated as a town. HALOT (electronic ed. page 60) identifies this verse as referring to a “settlement &gt; region” in Judah. UBS (page 207) says that the word refers to a social unit (clan), but that this is a case of metonymy in which the clan represents “the town where the clan members lived.” It recommends the “plain meaning” of the GNT “one of the smallest towns in Judah,” and says that “smallest probably refers both to size and to importance.”</span></span> Interpretation (1) is also much simpler and avoids the confusion over who belonged to a clan and how big a clan was in relation to other groups.</p><h4>5:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>out of you will come forth for Me One to be ruler over Israel—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>from you<sup>(sing)</sup> will come one who rules for me over Israel.</p></li><li><p>yet out of you will be born a ruler of Israel who represents me.</p></li><li><p>from there will come one who will rule on his behalf over Israel.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>out of you will come forth for Me One to be ruler over Israel:</strong> This clause is a prophecy about the coming of a future ruler. He will rule over Israel for the LORD. In the New Testament, Matthew (1:6) quoted this verse to indicate that Jesus fulfilled this prophecy.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>out of you will come forth:</strong> The pronoun <em>you</em> in this phrase refers to Bethlehem Ephrathah. That is the place where the ruler will come from. Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a ruler of Israel will come from you (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>out of you will come (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for Me:</strong> The pronoun <em>Me</em> refers to the LORD. The phrase <em>for Me</em> means “on my behalf.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Waltke 2007 (page 272) affirms this understanding of the Hebrew word as “dative of advantage to whom the action is directed, and of referring the pronoun to God….”</span></span> Here are some implications of this phrase:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The ruler will act on behalf of the LORD.</p></li><li><p>The ruler will truly obey the LORD.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Both a) and b) are suggested by UBS (page 207).</span></span></p></li><li><p>The ruler will follow the plan of the LORD and will promote His kingdom.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>KD (page 324).</span></span></p></li><li><p>The ruler (the Messiah) will come to serve the LORD and not himself.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Waltke 2007 (page 272) and ABC (page 1080).</span></span></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions make one or more of these implications clearer. Consider if it will be helpful to do the same in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will rule over Israel <u>on my behalf</u> (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will rule Israel <u>for me</u> (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>One to be ruler over Israel:</strong> The Hebrew word for <em>ruler</em> rather than the more specific word “king” is used here. If your language has a general word or phrase that refers to a person who rules a country, you should use it here.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some scholars believe there is no essential meaning difference between the Hebrew words for “ruler” and “king.” For example, NAC (page 97) mentions that both words can refer either to humans or to God in Micah as well as elsewhere in the OT. A&amp;F (page 467) makes the same point and cites Genesis 37:8 in which both words are used to refer to Joseph. Others believe it is significant that the Hebrew word for “ruler” is used instead of the word for “king.” For example, NICOT (page 343) suggests that the word “ruler” indicates a lesser, subordinate status to the divine “king.”</span></span> Here are some other ways to translate this verse part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But out of you will come for me a ruler out of Israel. (NIrV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>from you will come one who will rule Israel for me (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>5:2d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:2d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>One whose origins are of old,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He came from long ago,</p></li><li><p>His family line/origin is from the distant past.</p></li></ul></div><h4>5:2e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:2e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>from the days of eternity.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>in the distant past.”</p></li><li><p>It goes back many generations.”</p></li></ul></div><h4>5:2d–e</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallel lines that are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2d</sup>One whose <u>origins</u> are <strong>of old</strong>,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2e</sup> <strong>from the days of eternity</strong>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">There is an ellipsis (a deliberately omitted phrase) in 5:2e. In some languages, it may be necessary to supply the missing words from 5:2d. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2e</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">whose</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">origins</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">are</span> <strong>from days of eternity</strong>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>One whose origins are of old, from the days of eternity:</strong> In Hebrew, the word <em>origins</em> can refer to the place or the time period that something is from. A form of this word is translated as “come forth” in 5:2c. There it refers to the place that the ruler comes from. In 5:2d–e the word <em>origins</em> refers to the time period. This time period is indicated by the words <em>of old</em> and <em>from the days of eternity</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There is more than one way to interpret this verse part:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The ruler is ancient. He is the son of God and he has always existed.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>JFB (page 692) says that “as the Son of God, His goings forth are from everlasting.” KD (page 325), says that the Hebrew word for “origins” “can only affirm the going forth from God at the creation of the world….”</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>His goings forth are from long ago, from the days of eternity. (NASB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>The lineage of the ruler is ancient. His coming from Bethlehem implies that his ancestry goes back to the time of David.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to Waltke 2007 (page 275), the meaning of the Hebrew word for “origins” should be connected to the meaning in the first part of the verse. He comes from Bethlehem, which implies his ancestral origin from Jesse and the house of David. A&amp;F (page 467) also states that his lineage is the more likely meaning here.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will bring a ruler for Israel, whose family line goes back to ancient times. (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The LORD (speaking through Micah) may have meant both (1) and (2) here. If possible, translate these lines in a way that allows either or both interpretations to be understood. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>His origins go back to the distant past, to days long ago. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"></p>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>gives birth to her son (NLT96)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, the phrase “she who is in labor” may draw more attention to the mother than to the birth of the ruler.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Lord will abandon Israel only until this ruler is born (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>5:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>then the rest of His brothers will return to the children of Israel.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Then his relatives <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who were forced to live in other countries</span> will return to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">be reunited with</span> their people in Israel.</p></li><li><p>After that, his fellow Israelites will return <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from other nations</span> to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the land of</span> Israel to join their countrymen.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>then:</strong> In Hebrew, this verse part is introduced by a conjunction (<em>waw</em>) that can be translated here as either <em>then</em> or “and.” It indicates how this clause connects to the previous clauses. There are two main interpretations:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>This word introduces an event that follows the birth of the Messiah. After his birth, the message of salvation will begin to spread to all nations and at various times, the rest of his kindred will return. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>until the time when she who is in labor has given birth; <u>then</u> the rest of his brothers shall return to the people of Israel (ESV) <em>(GW, ESV, KJV, NABRE, BSB, NASB, NCV, NET, NJB, NJPS, NLT, NRSV, REB, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>This word introduces an event that is in addition to the birth of the Messiah. The rest of his kindred will return during the same period of time. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>until the time when she who is in labor bears a son, <u>and</u> the rest of his brothers return to join the Israelites (NIV11) <em>(CEV, NAB, NIV11)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). The LORD showed that he no longer abandoned his people by sending his own Son to live among them. Historically, after that time, people began to spiritually join the kingdom of God, and groups of Jews, his literal kindred, began to return to the nation of Israel.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The return of exiles described in Ezra and Nehemiah occurred long before the birth of the Messiah. If Micah 5:3 had been referring to these groups of exiles, the order of events would have been given in the opposite order.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the rest of His brothers:</strong> The pronoun <em>His</em> refers to the ruler that will be born.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>UBS (page 209) notes that grammatically the pronoun could refer to the LORD. However, the most natural way to understand it is as a reference to the son, the ruler to be born. See also EBC (page 530).</span></span> The phrase <em>the rest of His brothers</em> probably refers to Israelites in exile.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This understanding is supported by UBS (page 210), EBC (page 530) and A&amp;F (page 469). Some other suggestions are that the brothers are from the clans of Judah (Davis, page 106 and KD, page 327), or from the ten northern tribes (Elman, page 665 footnote).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his fellow countrymen (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those Israelites who are in exile (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will return to the children of Israel:</strong> This phrase probably refers to returning home to the land of Israel.

Since the word <em>sword</em> refers to a military weapon, the expression here indicates that the appointed leaders will fight and conquer the Assyrians before they rule over them.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to Waltke 2007 (page 291), Micah may include the word “sword” here to intensify that it will be the instrument of subjugation of the Assyrians.

The preceding parallel line 5:6a explicitly refers to Assyria, so the phrase <em>the land of Nimrod</em> is probably another way to refer to Assyria.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some that favor a reference to Assyria here are UBS and KD. Some scholars suggest that the phrase “the land of Nimrod” refers to Babylon. For example, CBC, Pusey, and Waltke 2007. Others suggest that the phrase may refer to either or both places. For example, WBC, NAC and JFB. However, no version translates the phrase as “the land of Babylon.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some translation options:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate this phrase literally. Leave the referent implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the land of Nimrod (NASB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the referent “Assyria” explicitly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the land of Assyria (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Consider adding a cross-reference to Genesis 10:8–12 here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>(ESV) at its entrances:</strong> This phrase has a textual issue:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Masoretic Text has “at its entrances/gates.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>KD (page 329) suggests that the Hebrew word for “entrances/gates” is parallel to the word “fortresses” in 5:5c, which may refer to city gates or entrances. In that verse, the Assyrians enter the city gates/entrances of Israel. In this verse, the Israelite leaders enter the city gates/entrances of Assyria. Alternately, JFB (page 693) suggests that this line is parallel to 5:5b, in which the Assyrians enter the land of Israel. As the Assyrian invade the borders of Israel, so will the Israelites invade the borders of Assyria. Either parallel is possible.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The land of Nimrod at its entrances (NASB) <em>(ESV, KJV, NASB, NJPS, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Some scholars think that the original text was “with a drawn sword.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example, see A&amp;F (page 480) and Davis (page 92).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the land of Nimrod with drawn sword (NIV) <em>(BSB, GW, NABRE, NCV, NET, NJB, NRSV, NIV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1). It makes sense without making any changes to the Hebrew text.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Option (2) “with drawn sword” requires emending the Hebrew text to make it clearly parallel to “sword” in the previous line. However, no textual evidence exists to support this emendation.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>at its entrances</em> means “entrances to a country.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDB #6607 (pages 835–836): “entrances to a country.”</span></span> Here the phrase refers to the country of Assyria.

It is supported by a majority of commentaries and a slight majority of versions, including the early versions, the LXX, and the Peshitta.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">One way to make it clearer that the word <em>He</em> refers back to the ruler in 5:5a is to make the referent explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>Our king</u> will rescue us from the Assyrians (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">He will use the appointed leaders to rescue the people from their enemy, the nation of Assyria.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause part refers back to the same situation that 5:5 describes. It does not refer to a separate Assyrian invasion. One way to make it clearer that this is not a new invasion is to make a backward reference explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>Thus</u> he will deliver [us] from Assyria (NJPS)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>In this way</u> he will save us from the Assyrians</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>deliver us when Assyria:</strong> This phrase is literally “and he will deliver [us] from Assyria.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>deliver</em> means “deliver,” “rescue,” or “save.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT #1404.</span></span> This phrase probably means that the one of peace will use the appointed leaders to drive away Israel’s enemies and keep the people safe.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">As in 5:5b, it is more natural in some languages to describe an attack by the people of a country rather than an attack by a country. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and he shall deliver us from <u>the Assyrian</u> (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Our king will rescue us from <u>the Assyrians</u> (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this phrase in a natural way in your language.</p><h4>5:6d–e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:6d–e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(combined/reordered)</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>they invade our territory (GNT)</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallel lines that are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6c-d</sup>So He will deliver us <u>when Assyria</u> <strong>invades our land</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6e</sup> <strong>and marches into our borders.</strong></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">There is an ellipsis (a deliberately omitted phrase) in 5:6e.

This prophecy is about the effect that the remnant of Jacob will have on other people groups.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Then:</strong> In Hebrew, this word is literally “and it will be.” It does not indicate that the events in this prophecy immediately follow those described in 5:6. It introduces a new prophecy that is separate but related to those that precede it. Some versions do not use a connecting word like <em>Then</em>. Instead, they allow the context to imply the change. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The people of Israel who survive (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The remnant of Jacob (NJPS)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Indicate this change of prophecy in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>remnant of Jacob:</strong> The word <em>remnant</em> refers to people who remain alive after many others have died.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT #2307b states that the Hebrew word is about those who survive after a previous elimination process or catastrophe.</span></span> It implies a small number of people compared to a larger population in past times.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NIDOTTE (Volume 4, pages 11–16) says that Micah speaks of a tiny historical remnant.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>of Jacob</em> means “descended from Jacob.” In Micah, this phrase is a way to refer to all Israelites. The reference includes people from all twelve tribes. Some are from the northern kingdom of Israel, and some are from the southern kingdom of Judah.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NAC (page 103) and UBS (pages 215–216).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate <em>remnant of Jacob</em>:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The people of Israel who survive (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>A few of Jacob’s descendants survived (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in the midst of many peoples:</strong> In some contexts, this phrase describes the situation of Israelites who live as prisoners or refugees in various countries outside their homeland of Israel.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A&amp;F (page 485) and UBS (pages 215–216).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, this prophesy speaks of a time in the future when the remnant is no longer scattered in various places outside of Israel. They return to Israel to live.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This is more clearly the situation described in verse 5:8. The parallelism between verses 7 and 8 suggests that the same situation pertains to both verses. See NIDOTTE (Vol. 4, pages 11–16), JFB (page 638) and Waltke 2007 (page 306).</span></span> So it is reasonable to conclude that here the words <em>many peoples</em> refer to the non-Israelite people who live in countries that surround the land of Israel.</p><h4>5:7b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7b</sup> <u>like dew</u> from the LORD,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7c</sup> <u>like showers</u> on the grass</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">There is an ellipsis (a deliberately omitted phrase) in 5:7b–c. In some languages, it may be necessary to supply the missing words from 5:7a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7b</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they will be</span> <u>like dew</u> from the LORD,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7c</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they will be</span> <u>like showers</u> on the grass</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">These parallel lines are similes that compare the remnant of Jacob to dew and to showers. There are two main interpretations of how the remnant is similar to dew and showers:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The LORD will bless people of other nations through the remnant. This is comparable to how he blesses the earth and vegetation through dew and showers.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>JFB (page 693), ABC (page 1081), TOTC (page 204), Waltke 2007 (page 307), NICOT (pages 353–354), KD (page 330), NAC (pages 103–104), UBS (pages 216–217), WBC (pages 46–47) and Davis (page 112).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then the people of Jacob who are left alive will be <u>to</u> other people like dew from the Lord or rain on the grass (NCV) <em>(NCV, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is certain that the LORD will restore the population and/or the status of Israel among the nations. This is comparable to the certainty that the LORD sends dew and showers. No one can stop it from happening.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>CBC (page 331).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then the remnant left in Israel will take their place among the nations. They will be like dew sent by the Lord or like rain falling on the grass, which <u>no one can hold back and no one can restrain</u>. (NLT) <em>(NLT, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">Most versions are ambiguous as to which interpretation they follow.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Two other interpretations also have support from multiple commentators but are not included in this note because no version appears to follow them. One is that the point of similarity between dew, showers and the remnant is that all are under divine control. This interpretation is similar to the meaning of the parallel lines that follow these similes. Variations of this interpretation are proposed by A&amp;F (page 485) and Margolis (pages 55–56). Another interpretation is that the LORD will judge Israel’s enemies through the remnant. Restored Israel will overwhelm her enemies the way dew completely covers grass. This interpretation is similar to the meaning of verse 8. See McKeating (page 180), EBC (pages 533–534) and the NET footnote for this verse.</span></span> It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with many commentaries.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A main support for this interpretation is that it fits the most common figurative meaning of “dew” and “showers.” See more detail in the note for “dew…showers” below. Another support for this interpretation is that the context of verse 8 clearly refers to Israel’s influence on other nations (in that case not beneficial). The parallel of verse 7 to verse 8 suggests that this verse also refers to Israel’s influence on others, not just God’s blessing on Israel. See NICOT (pages 353–354). These similes may refer back to the prophecy in Micah 4:1–4, which also talks about how other nations will be blessed through Israel. See ABC (page 1081).</span></span> However, interpretation (2) is also acceptable. Both interpretations fit the context. Interpretation (2) is probably implied in interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This part of the chapter is about the future strength of Israel and its leaders. So this prophecy probably refers to the LORD’s blessing on Israel along with his blessing on other nations through Israel.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>dew…showers:</strong> These two words are similar in meaning. The word <em>dew</em> refers to water droplets that collect on plants or on the ground during the night. It can also refer to light rain. Dew was very important in that part of the world. It kept plants alive in seasons that had no rain.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>UBS (pages 216–217).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>showers</em> generally refers to a large amount of rain.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDB #7241 page 914).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the Old Testament <em>dew</em> and <em>showers</em> are often used as figures of speech to indicate something beneficial.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example, NAC (pages 103–104) cites Psalms 72:6, 16–19.

The Hebrew word translated as <em>grass</em> means “green plants” or “grass.” Since the word describes plants that are valuable to both humans and animals, it is used in figures of speech to indicate blessing.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NIDOTTE (Volume 3, page 546).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>showers on growing plants (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>showers on vegetation (NASB)</p></blockquote><h4>5:7d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:7d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>which do not wait for man</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>which do not require <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the help of</span> people</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The dew and rain</span> do not rely on human beings</p></li></ul></div><h4>5:7e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:7e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>or linger for mankind.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>or put their hope in humans.</p></li><li><p>or <span data-bnType=\"implied\">need</span> to wait for <span data-bnType=\"implied\">help from</span> anyone.</p></li></ul></div><h4>5:7d–e</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7d</sup> <u>which do not wait for</u> <strong>man</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7e</sup> <u>or linger for</u> <strong>mankind</strong>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">There is an ellipsis (a deliberately omitted phrase) in 5:7c. In some languages, it may be necessary to supply the missing words from 5:7b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7c</sup> <u>neither</u> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">do they</span> <u>linger for</u> <strong>mankind</strong>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">These lines are more literally “which does not wait for man and does not wait patiently for the sons of mankind.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Grammatically, the verbs are singular and point to a singular referent. Probably that referent is “dew.” Other possible referents are “remnant” or “grass.” “Remnant” is probably not the intended direct referent because it is only indirectly referred to via the similes. “Grass” is also unlikely. The similes compare the remnant to dew and showers, not to grass. Here are two suggestions for the singular verbs in the MT: According to KD (page 330), the verbs refer to the principle idea of the preceding clause, the “dew,” to which “showers” are explanatory and subordinate. UBS (pages 216–217) suggests that “dew was recognized as a direct gift of God which man could do nothing to provide for himself, and the description here is probably an allusion to this.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">These lines describe the dew and showers in 7b–c. The meaning of the lines is probably that these processes of nature occur with no need for human involvement. The LORD is the one who controls them. By implication, the LORD is also in control of what will happen to the remnant.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some ways to translate these lines:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Make explicit that “dew” and “showers” are the referents.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This option is followed by the Peshitta and by most modern versions.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples like <u>dew</u> from the Lord, like <u>showers</u> on the grass, which <u>do not wait</u> for anyone or <u>depend</u> on man. (NIV11)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Leave implicit a singular referent.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This option follows the Masoretic Text forms. However, in some languages it may wrongly imply that the referent is “grass” rather than “dew” or “dew” and “showers.”</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>it does not wait</u> for human beings; <u>it does not pause</u> for any person. (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Make “remnant” the direct referent instead of “dew” and “showers.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This option is different from the Masoretic Text, which gives an indirect reference to the remnant by means of the similes of dew and showers. However, the overall meaning of the verse remains the same. In some languages it may not be natural to personify dew and showers as waiting for humans. This may be a useful alternative translation option in those languages.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The <u>people of Israel who survive</u> will be like refreshing dew sent by the Lord for many nations, like showers on growing plants. <u>They</u> will depend on God, not people. (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>which:</strong> The relative pronoun <em>which</em> refers back to the referent in the previous lines. In some languages, it will be more natural to translate this line without using a relative pronoun. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>They</u> do not put <u>their</u> hope in humans or wait for mortals. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>wait for…linger for:</strong> In Hebrew, these verbs are more literally “wait…wait patiently.” Both words can be translated in this context as “wait,” “hope,” or “depend.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See TWOT #1994 I “wait, look for, hope.” See also NIDOTTE #859 (page 373) “wait, hope.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate these words:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>put their hope in…wait (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>need…require</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>man…mankind:</strong> These terms are two ways to refer to human beings.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>One meaning of the word “mortal” is human limits (see Merriam Webster “mortal” #5). Mortal/limited human beings have no control over the dew and the showers.</span></span> Some versions translate these words in a way that more clearly indicates the inability of human beings to control dew and showers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>which do not depend on human agency and are beyond human control (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They do not put their hope in humans or wait for mortals.

It best fits the parallelism, which depicts two types of prey, wild animals and domesticated animals. These parallel phrases may be a figure of speech. In this figure of speech, the two types of prey indicate all animals. Therefore, the similes imply that the remnant will conquer all surrounding nations, whether they are large and powerful or small and weak.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Waltke 2007 (pages 310–312).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate the parallel lines:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate 5:8c–d as a single sentence. The parallel lines describe the lion. The remainder of the verse describes what the lion does. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They will be like a lion among the animals of the forest, like a strong young lion among flocks of sheep and goats, pouncing and tearing as they go with no rescuer in sight. (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate 5:8c–d as two sentences. The parallel lines about the lion are in one sentence. The remainder of the verse is a separate sentence that refers back to the lion. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They will be like a lion among animals in the forest, like a young lion among flocks of sheep. When a lion hunts, it tramples its victims and tears them to pieces and there is no one to rescue them. (GW)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Combine and/or reorder the parallel lines. Translate the remainder of 5:8c–d as a separate clause that refers back to the lion. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Those who are left among the nations will be like a lion hunting for food in a forest or a pasture: it gets in among the sheep, pounces on them, and tears them to pieces—and there is no hope of rescue.

The LORD accused the people of Israel of failing to keep his requirements. Some scholars refer to this accusation as a “covenant lawsuit” because his requirements were based on his covenant with Israel.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example, ZIBBC (pages 140–141), Hays (page 315), and CBC (page 334).</span></span> Scholars point out, however, that this lawsuit was not conventional in some ways. For example, there was no judge, the witnesses were silent, and there was no pronouncement of punishment.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>ZIBBC (pages 140–141) and A&amp;F (page 513).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples of section headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lord’s case against Israel (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God Challenges Israel (NRSV)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1033006001\" data-endVerseId=\"1033006002\"><h3>Paragraph 6:1–2</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">The lawsuit/trial began with these verses. Micah called on the people to hear the LORD’s case against them and called on the mountains/hills to be witnesses.</p></div><h4>6:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Hear now what the LORD says:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Listen<span data-bnType=\"implied\">, people of Israel</span> to what Yahweh has to say:</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">People of Israel,</span> pay attention to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the charges</span> Yahweh has <span data-bnType=\"implied\">against you<sup>(plur)</sup></span>:</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Hear now what the LORD says:</strong> This command to hear/listen starts a new prophecy/oracle in which Micah introduced the LORD’s lawsuit.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Hear:</strong> The word <em>Hear</em> is plural. Micah was speaking to the people of Israel. In some languages, it may be more natural to make the addressee explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Listen to what the LORD says <u>to his people</u></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In Hebrew, the word <em>Hear</em> is followed by a particle that indicates emphasis or insistence.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The literal command is “<em>šimʿû–nāʾ</em>.” The particle <em>nāʾ</em> is defined by TWOT #1269 as “particle of entreaty or exhortation,” and by HALOT (electronic edition, page 656) as “particle giving emphasis.” A&amp;F (page 514) state that the particle makes the command “peremptory and insistent rather than pleading.”</span></span> Many versions leave this particle implied. Some English versions translate it as “now.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>Now</u> listen to what Yahweh says: (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this emphasis in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>what the LORD says:</strong> This phrase refers to the charge/case that the LORD will present. Some versions make this meaning explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Listen to the Lord’s <u>case</u> against Israel. (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>6:1b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning. The NIV11 has been used as the source line for 6:1b, because it follows the recommended interpretation:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1b</sup>(NIV11) “<u>Stand up, plead my case before</u> <strong>the mountains</strong>;</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1c</sup>and <u>let</u> <strong>the hills</strong> <u>hear your voice</u>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">These lines are more literally “Arise conduct a case with the mountains and let hear the hills your voice.” The literal Hebrew commands in 6:1b do not have an explicit pronoun such as “my” or “your.” Most versions supply one of these pronouns in 6:1b to make their interpretation clearer.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">There are three main interpretations of the identity of the participants in these parallel commands:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The LORD commanded Micah to rise and conduct the LORD’s case against the people of Israel. The mountains and hills were to hear Micah’s voice. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Come, present [My] case before the mountains, and let the hills hear you pleading (NJPS) <em>(NIV11, NJPS)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The LORD commanded Israel to rise and conduct Israel’s case against him.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The main context for this interpretation is 6:3. Israel’s complaint is implied by the rhetorical questions “what have I done to you? and How have I burdened you?” Commentaries that support interpretation (2) include NAC (pages 108–109), JFB (page 693), and CBC (page 334).</span></span> The mountains and hills were to hear Israel’s voice. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Stand up and state your case against me. Let the mountains and hills be called to witness your complaints. (NLT) <em>(CEV, NCV, NET, NLT)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>These versions make explicit this interpretation.</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Micah told the LORD to rise and conduct the LORD’s case against the people of Israel.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The main context for this interpretation is 6:2. In 6:1b–c Micah tells the LORD to conduct his case. In 6:2 the LORD complies by opening the case, referring to himself in 3rd person. Commentaries that support interpretation (3) include A&amp;F (page 514) and UBS (page 225).</span></span> The mountains and hills were to hear the LORD’s voice. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Arise, O Lord, and present your case; let the mountains and the hills hear what you say. (GNT) <em>(GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">Some versions that translate 6:1b with “your case” are ambiguous. In these versions, the referent of “your” could be either Israel or the LORD.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with the majority of commentaries.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Commentaries that support interpretation (1) include NICOT, KD, EBC, Waltke 2007, and TOTC.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the mountains…the hills:</strong> In 6:1–8, the mountains and the hills are parallel figures of speech (personification).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>JFB (Volume 1, page 693), NAC (pages 108–109), and KD (page 333).</span></span> Here they represented witnesses at a trial in a court of law. They were fitting witnesses because they were present throughout all of Israel’s history. Thus, they had figuratively seen everything good that the LORD has done for Israel as well as the people’s acts of disloyalty.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>UBS (page 225).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate this figure of speech:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the personification. This is the best option if the figure is natural in your language and people will understand the meaning correctly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Stand up, plead my case before the mountains; let the hills hear what you have to say. (NIV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Change the personification to a simile. Consider making the similarity of the mountains and hills to witnesses explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Arise and state my case. Speak <u>as if</u> the mountains and hills can hear you <u>like witnesses in the trial</u>.</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>6:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Arise, plead your case before the mountains,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He says to me,</span> “Arise to present my case before the mountains,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He tells me to</span> stand and conduct a lawsuit in the presence of the mountains</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(NIV11) Stand up:</strong> This command often functions as a call to action.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A&amp;F (page 514).</span></span> In the context of a legal case the gesture signifies the start of the court session.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>CBC (page 334).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(NIV11) plead my case:</strong> This phrase means “to fight with words,” as in a quarrel or a legal case. Here it refers to a legal case or lawsuit.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In Hebrew, <em>rîḇ</em>.</span></span></p><h4>6:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and let the hills hear your voice.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and the hills need to hear what you<sup>(sing)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">are about to</span> say.”</p></li><li><p>and the hills.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and let the hills hear your voice:</strong> In this clause, the phrase <em>let the hills hear</em> does not mean to allow or give permission to hear.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This is a Hebrew jussive form that indicates a desire or wish.</span></span> It means that the LORD wanted the hills to hear his case against Israel. The words <em>your voice</em> refer to the voice of Micah as he presented the LORD’s case.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Present my case before the hills</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and also before the hills</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:1b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to combine and/or reorder these parallel statements.

Micah called on the people to hear the LORD’s case against them and called on the mountains/hills to be witnesses.</p></div><h4>6:2a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2a</sup>“<u>Hear</u>, <strong>O mountains</strong>, <strong>the LORD’s indictment</strong>,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2b</sup> <strong>you enduring foundations of the earth</strong>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">There is an ellipsis (a deliberately omitted phrase) in 6:2b. In some languages, it may be necessary to supply the missing words from 6:2a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2b</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">hear</span> <strong>you enduring foundations of the earth</strong> <strong>the LORD’s indictment</strong>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In these parallel lines, Micah began conducting the case of the LORD against Israel. He first called/summoned the mountains and the foundations of the earth to be witnesses in the case.</p><h4>6:2a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:2a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Hear, O mountains, the LORD’s indictment,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>O mountains, hear Yahweh’s case.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">So</span> listen <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as witnesses</span> in Yahweh’s lawsuit, you<sup>(plur)</sup> mountains</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Hear:</strong> This is the same Hebrew word as in 6:1a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>O mountains:</strong> Here Micah addressed the mountains directly, as if they could hear and understand him. Some versions have added the word “you” or <em>O</em> to make it clear that <em>O mountains</em>, is a term of address (vocative).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a term of address (vocative) that is natural in your language when a person speaks to a group of listeners. In some languages, it may be helpful to use a simile here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Mountains, I call on you <u>as witnesses</u> to listen to the accusation of the LORD.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the LORD’s indictment:</strong> In Hebrew, the word for <em>indictment</em> is a form of the same word as “plead my case” in 6:1b.

However, Micah may have used the phrase <em>His people</em> to remind them that they were obligated to live according to their covenant with the LORD.

The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as “have I wearied you” in 6:3b sounds similar to the Hebrew word that the BSB translates as “I brought you up” in 6:4a. This word play may have emphasized a contrast, as if the LORD were saying “I have not wearied you.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I brought you out of Egypt (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>brought you up…redeemed you:</strong> Both phrases refer to the LORD’s rescue of the people from slavery in Egypt.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>UBS (page 228).</span></span> The phrase <em>brought you up</em> describes it as a change of their location. The phrase <em>redeemed you</em> describes it as a change of their circumstances from being slaves to being free people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>brought you up:</strong> The Hebrew word for <em>brought you up</em> literally means to bring someone upward from a lower to a higher place. It also has a figurative meaning of raising someone up from the underworld, giving life to someone dead.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>LTW “Resurrection.”</span></span> In this context, it may have both literal and figurative meanings.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Literally, Egypt was at a lower elevation than the places where the LORD brought them. Figuratively the LORD rescuing them from Egypt was comparable to his raising them from death to new life.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages will not have a single word or phrase with both these meanings. If that is true in your language it is recommended that you translate the literal meaning and leave the figurative meaning implied.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There are other Old Testament references to the same event that use the Hebrew word for “bring out” rather than “bring up.” An example is in Exodus 6:26. These other references suggest that the primary meaning of these similar phrases is the literal removal of the people from Egypt.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>For <u>I brought you out</u> of Egypt (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>redeemed you:</strong> In Hebrew, the word that the BSB translates as <em>redeemed you</em> is literally “I ransomed you.” The word “ransom” means “transfer ownership of a person or object to another through payment of a price or an equivalent substitute.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT (#1734) explains that when God delivered Israel from servitude to Egypt, the price he paid was the slaughter of the firstborn in Egypt, man and beast. Another suggestion is made by NICOT (pages 365–357). He says that here the Hebrew word for “I ransomed you,” has the general sense of release without thought of payment to the Egyptians.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate the word in this context:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and <u>ransomed you</u> from the house of slavery (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>from the place of slavery I <u>released you</u> (NAB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and <u>freed you</u> from slavery (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the land of Egypt…the house of slavery:</strong> Both phrases refer to Egypt. The phrase <em>the land of Egypt</em> describes the literal location. The phrase <em>the house of slavery</em> describes Egypt figuratively with reference to the circumstances of the people while they were there.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>UBS (page 228).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>house of slavery:</strong> In this phrase, the word <em>house</em> refers to a place, the land of Egypt. It does not indicate a literal house.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the place where you were forced to work very hard<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This suggestion is from UBS (page 228).</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the place of slavery (NAB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the land of slavery (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the place of slave-labour (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions leave the word <em>house</em> implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I rescued you from slavery (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>6:4c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:4c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I sent Moses before you, as well as Aaron and Miriam.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Indeed, I sent Moses, Aaron and Miriam to lead you<sup>(sing/plur)</sup>.</p></li><li><p>To help you I sent Miriam, Aaron, and Moses.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I sent Moses before you, as well as Aaron and Miriam:</strong> The LORD gave the people effective leaders. This was a second significant event in Israel’s past that gave evidence of the LORD’s goodness to his people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I sent…before you:</strong> This phrase probably indicates that the LORD chose and sent Moses, Aaron and Miriam to lead the people out of Egypt, through the wilderness of Sinai, and to the promised land.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some commentators point out that Moses, Aaron, and Miriam each served a prophetic role. This role is not made explicit here but their role as the representatives and spokesmen for the LORD is probably an implication of this phrase. See A&amp;F (page 519), and Davis (page 123).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>I sent</u> Moses, Aaron, and Miriam <u>to lead you</u>. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>I sent</u> Moses, Aaron, and Miriam <u>to help you</u>. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>I sent</u> Moses, Aaron, and Miriam <u>to you</u>. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Moses…Aaron and Miriam:</strong> The Hebrew is more literally, “I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.” In some languages it is natural to list the most important name first, as is shown here. The BSB and some other translations separate Moses to stylistically show his importance. Others follow the Hebrew more closely. The birth order of these siblings was probably Miriam, Aaron, and Moses. In some other languages, it is natural to list the oldest first. Translate these three names in the order that is most natural in your language.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For this suggestion see UBS (page 228).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"></p>",

It is more literally “from (the) Shittim to (the) Gilgal.” Most versions supply additional words such as “and what happened” in order to make the translation sound more natural.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is probably a reference to the people’s journey <em>from Shittim to Gilgal</em>. It is another event from Israel’s history that the LORD wanted the people to remember.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Davis (page 124) suggests that the verb ‘remember’ from 6:5a probably applies here also. See also Pusey (page 81), UBS (page 229), and NAC (page 111).</span></span> Consider placing a cross-reference here to Joshua 3–4.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The miraculous crossing of the Jordan river is probably the main event that the LORD referred to here.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This is the majority view of commentators. For example, NICOT, UBS, NAC, Davis, Waltke 2007, and TOTC.</span></span> Some versions make this referent explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>consider <u>the crossing</u> from Shittim to Gilgal (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, it is possible that the reference is both to the crossing of the Jordan river and to other events as well.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some commentators suggest that the reference may include Israel’s unfaithfulness at Baal Peor, the defeat of the Midianites, and the circumcision at Gilgal. See CBC (page 335) and KD (pages 334–335).</span></span> Most versions translate this clause in a way that leaves the specific events implicit. The BSB above is one example. Here is another example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>[Recall your passage]</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>From Shittim to Gilgal (NJPS)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Shittim:</strong> Shittim was a location on the east bank of the Jordan river.

Translate this word in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you may acknowledge:</strong> This phrase is literally “to know.” Most versions supply a phrase such as <em>you may</em> or “you might” as natural ways to introduce a result or a purpose clause in English. Here the phrase <em>you may</em> or “you might” does not indicate permission or uncertainty.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In Hebrew, the verb that the BSB translates as <em>acknowledge</em> has more than one meaning related to knowing, experiencing, and understanding. In this context, the word may have more than one aspect of meaning.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Aaron C. Fenlason, “Belief,” <em>Lexham Theological Wordbook</em>, Lexham Bible Reference Series (Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press, 2014) notes that the Hebrew word “indicates cognizance or mental awareness of something usually by means of personal experience.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The following examples are all acceptable ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for you to know (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And you will recognize (NJPS)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and you will realize (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the righteousness of the LORD:</strong> In Hebrew, this clause is more literally “the righteousness(es) of Yahweh.” The righteousness(es) of the LORD were his actions that were faithful to the terms of his covenant with the people of Israel.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Waltke 2007 (page 357), NICOT (pages 367–369), and EBC (page 539).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The LORD showed his righteousness by saving his people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Waltke 2007 (page 357) cites Achtemeier, who says “In short, Yahweh’s righteous judgments are saving judgments…. Yahweh’s salvation of Israel is his righteousness, his fulfillment of his covenant with her.”</span></span> Some versions make this connection between his righteousness and his saving acts explicit. For example, the NRSV and some other versions translate “the righteousness(es) of Yahweh” as “the saving acts of the LORD” or something similar.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>…the Lord has treated you fairly.” (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>…the Lord does what is right.” (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the LORD:</strong> Here the LORD referred to himself using third person, <em>the LORD</em>.

Some other versions supply a word like “when” or “and” to make the line sound more natural in English.

Rather, he had blessed them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In 6:6–8, the people (or a representative of the people) gave their response to this evidence. Their response in 6:6a–b was to ask a general question about what to bring to the LORD to please him. In 6:6c–d through 6:7, they asked about specific offerings. The offerings in 6:7 had higher value than those in 6:6.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In 6:8, Micah answered the people’s questions by reminding them of the LORD’s requirements.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The number and kind of offerings talked about in 6:7 appear to be exaggerated and unrealistic. This exaggeration may indicate that the people were insincere,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example, NICOT (pages 369–370) regards the questions as satirical.</span></span> or that they were truly unaware of what the LORD desired of them.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Many commentators suggest that the questions were sincere.

His answer was to remind the people what the LORD required of them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some versions begin this verse with the word “No,” to make the connection of this verse to the previous questions more explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No, O people, the Lord has told you what is good (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">There are three main ways to translate the structure of the clauses in this verse:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Translate 6:8a as a statement. Translate 6:8b–c as a rhetorical question.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The implied answer to the question is “nothing else is required.”</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>8a</sup>He has told you, O man, what is good;</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>8b–c</sup>and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?

Some versions have added the word <em>O</em> to make it clear that <em>O man</em> is a term of address (vocative). Use a vocative that is natural in your language when a person speaks to a group of people or a representative of a group.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In Hebrew, the phrase <em>O man</em> is literally the word “adam.” Here “adam” is the word for “human.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>DCH (pages 126–127).</span></span> It is not a name. This vocative may imply a contrast between finite human beings and the infinite God.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NICOT (page 371).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He has told you, O mortal, what is good (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Lord has told you, human, what is good (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>what is good:</strong> This phrase means “that which is good.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDB #4078 says that in some cases the question word “what” approximates in meaning to the simple relative.</span></span> In Hebrew, the word <em>good</em> has a wide range of meaning.

For examples of each form of the clause, see the Note on 6:8 “three main ways to translate the structure of the clauses.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The connecting word <em>And</em> begins this clause. It may indicate that the phrase in 6:8a “He has told you” applies to this clause as well. Not only has the LORD told the people what is good, he has also told them what he requires of them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>8b</sup>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he has told you</span> what he requires of you:</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions leave this connection implied.

However he also required good, moral attitudes and behavior. In this clause the word <em>but</em> contrasts these two thoughts.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Waltke 2007 (page 364) says the full thought is this: “You thought <em>I AM</em> requires sacrifice, <em>but rather</em> he requires ethical behavior.”</span></span> Most versions leave this contrast implicit.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you wish to make this contrast more explicit in your translation, here are some examples:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So what does the Lord require of you? He requires <u>not only sacrifices but/rather</u> for you to be just, to love mercy, and to live humbly with your God.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He has told you what he wants from you. <u>He does not want more offerings, but</u> for you to do what is right, to love being kind to others, and to live in humble obedience to your God.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>act justly:</strong> In Hebrew, the word translated as <em>act justly</em> has a broad range of meanings related to actions that are right and just. It can refer to judicial process as well as an attribute of man in general.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT (#2443c).</span></span> In this phrase, it may refer especially to fair and honest treatment of those who are weak or powerless.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TOTC (page 213) and NICOT (page 373).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>do what is right (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>do what is just (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>promote justice (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>love mercy:</strong> This phrase means to show kindness even when it is not required or deserved. It refers to both activities and attitudes.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>CBC (pages 336–338).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word that the BSB translates as <em>love</em> means to “like” or “love” a thing. It can refer to love for either physical/concrete or abstract things.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT (#29).</span></span> Here the meaning is to love to do kind deeds.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In Hebrew, the word that the BSB translates as <em>mercy</em> has several aspects of meaning:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>steadfastness, loyalty</p></li><li><p>kindness, mercy</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this phrase in a way that fits naturally in the context. Here it may refer particularly to showing a concern for the needs of others. The LORD’s covenant with Israel required them to have this concern in response to the love that the LORD had shown to them.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT (#698a) says God was obviously in a covenant relationship with Israel, and he expressed this relationship in eternal <em>ḥesed</em>, but <em>ḥesed</em> does not necessarily involve a covenant nor does it mean loyalty to a covenant. Rather, it is a kind of love, including mercy, close to the KJV rendering “lovingkindness.” Vine (page 142) insists that three basic meanings of the word always interact: kindness, steadfastness, and love. He says that <em>ḥesed</em> is not only a matter of obligation within a relationship; it is also generosity. It is not only a matter of loyalty, but also of mercy.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>let mercy be your first concern (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>show constant love (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>love being kind to others (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>walk humbly with your God:</strong> In this phrase the word <em>walk</em> is a figure of speech that means “follow a pattern of conduct or a lifestyle.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Mounce (page 924).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In Hebrew, the word <em>humbly</em> has a range of meanings related to being careful, wise, and prudent.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT (electronic edition, page 1039).</span></span> These qualities depend upon a person having an attitude of submission/humility to God and a desire to conform to his will.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>EBC (page 540) and TOTC (page 214).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>humbly obey your God (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>live in humble fellowship with our God (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"></p>",

In 6:9–12, the LORD charged the people of Jerusalem and the tribe of Judah with theft, dishonesty, deception, and violence. In 6:13–15, he stated how he will punish them. In 6:16, the LORD restated in a short summary the people’s sin and their punishment. In this section, the LORD was the speaker except for 6:9, in which Micah told the people of the city to listen.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples of section headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Cheating and Violence to Be Punished (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Israel’s Guilt and Punishment (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Accusations and Covenant Curses<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Suggestion by A&amp;F (pages 541–544)</span></span></p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1033006009\" data-endVerseId=\"1033006016\"><h3>Paragraph 6:9–16</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, the LORD accused the people of committing several kinds of sin. Most were sins committed by wealthy people. Some were sins by the general population.</p></div><h4>6:9</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In the first and third clauses of verse 6:9, Micah told the people to pay attention. He told them that the LORD was calling out to the city and the tribe of Judah to listen. This function of calling attention is similar to the first clause of 6:1, in which Micah told the people to listen to the LORD’s case against them. The second clause of verse 6:9 has a style of writing that resembles a wisdom saying.</p><h4>6:9a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:9a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The voice of the LORD calls out to the city</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Hear</span> the voice of Yahweh <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that</span> cries out to the city.</p></li><li><p>¶ Listen<span data-bnType=\"implied\">, people of</span> the city, to what Yahweh has to say</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The voice of the LORD calls out to the city:</strong> This clause is a statement. However, it functions as a call by Micah to the residents of the city. He urged them to give attention to what the LORD was about to say to them. Some versions supply a word such as “hear” or “listen” to make this function clear.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Hebrew grammarians differ in their analysis of the phrase “the voice of Yahweh.” Some regard it as the subject of the verb “cries out.” Others propose that either the word “voice” or the entire phrase “the voice of Yahweh” is an exclamation. Regardless of the grammatical understanding, the phrase serves the function of securing attention. See Waltke 2007 (page 395) and A&amp;F (page 545).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Listen! The Lord is calling to the city! (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>calls out:</strong> In Hebrew, this word means “call” or “summon” someone.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NIDOTTE #7924 (page 971) and DCH (pages 289–290). EBC (page 542) suggests that here the word may connote “call out a warning.” Waltke 2007 (page 396) suggests it may connote “make a proclamation.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Lord calls to the city (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Hark! The Lord summons the city (NJPS)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the city:</strong> This phrase refers to Jerusalem.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This is the view of a majority of commentators. For example, UBS, NAC, KD, JFB, and Waltke 2007.</span></span> Some versions make this identification explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So listen to my message for the city of Jerusalem.

The Masoretic Text has “and success/wisdom it will see your name” and the LXX has “and he will save those fearing his name.” However, this textual issue is not included in the Notes because nearly all modern versions follow the Masoretic Text here.</span></span></p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is a definition or description of wisdom. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and to fear your name is wisdom (NIV) <em>(BSB, ESV, GW, NAB, NASB, NIV, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is a statement about wise behavior. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is wise to fear the Lord. (GNT) <em>(KJV,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The KJV has “and the man of wisdom shall see thy name.” It may fit under this interpretation.</span></span> NET, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is an exhortation to wise people to fear the LORD. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Fear the Lord if you are wise! (NLT) <em>(NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">You may follow any of these interpretations. Interpretation (1) is followed by more versions. However, the difference in meaning between the interpretations is very slight. All of them indicate a connection between wisdom and fear of the LORD. All of them also imply an exhortation to fear the LORD, even though only interpretation (3) makes it explicit.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is similar to a proverb or wisdom saying. The words in 6:9b are not the words that the LORD cries to the city. Rather, this clause briefly interrupts the message here and is probably parenthetical.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This is indicated by the change of focus from the LORD calling to the city in the previous clause to a proverbial style wisdom saying here by someone apparently addressing the LORD with the phrase “your name.” A&amp;F (page 546) refers to this clause as a “pious aside.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to indicate that these are not the words that the LORD cries to the city:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Mark this clause as parenthetical. The BSB above is an example.</p></li><li><p>Move this clause to another part of the verse that does not interrupt the flow of logic. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>9b</sup>It is wise to fear the Lord. He calls to the city, <sup>9a,c</sup>“Listen, you people who assemble in the city!” (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause addresses the LORD directly using the second-person phrase “your name.” In some languages it may be more natural to express this saying with third-person forms such as “the LORD” or “his name.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It is wise to fear the Lord (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the fear of his name brings success (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a natural way in your language to translate this saying.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sound wisdom:</strong> In Hebrew, the word that the BSB translates as <em>sound wisdom</em> refers to the wisdom or practical good sense that leads to a successful result.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This note is taken in full from the glossary entry “sound judgment (Hebrew: <em>tušiyyah</em>)” in Translator’s Notes on Proverbs.</span></span> The word includes two ideas:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>competence, good sense, ability to plan what to do</p></li><li><p>the success that results from this ability.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The word focuses more on making an effective plan than on understanding a complicated situation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>prudence</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>discernment</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>fear Your name:</strong> There is a textual issue with the word that the BSB translates as <em>fear</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The LXX has “fear.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and it is sound wisdom to fear your name (ESV) <em>(ESV, GW, BSB, NAB, NASB, NIV, NLT, NRSV, REB, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Masoretic Text has “see.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and the man of wisdom shall see thy name (KJV) <em>(KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1) along with most versions.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>fear:</strong> The LXX word translated as <em>fear</em> indicates both real fear and reverential awe.

It is another way to refer to him.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT (electronic edition, pages 1550–1551) calls the phrase “an interchangeable expression for Yahweh.” NAC (page 100) says it refers to the LORD himself or to his manifested character.</span></span> The phrase <em>Your name</em> implies his character and his attributes, such as his power and authority.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Lord (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>O Lord (NET)</p></blockquote><h4>6:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Heed the rod and the One who ordained it.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Hear <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his voice</span>, O nation and assembly of the city!</p></li><li><p>Tribe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Judah</span> and people assembled in Jerusalem, listen <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to what Yahweh has to say</span>!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">The NRSV has been used as the source line for 6:9c, because it follows the recommended interpretation.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(NRSV) Hear, O tribe and assembly of the city!:</strong> There is a textual issue with this clause:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some scholars think that the original text was “Hear, O tribe, and the assembly of the city.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Listen, you tribe assembled in the city.

However, elsewhere in the Old Testament, the command “hear” calls attention to what a person says, as in option (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A&amp;F (page 545) notes that the Hebrew word for “hear,” especially after the Hebrew word for “voice,” must mean “listen (to words).”</span></span> It does not call attention to an inanimate object or to what the object represents, as in option (2).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In this command, Micah summons the people of the tribe and the city to hear. The implicit object of the verb <em>Hear</em> is the voice of the LORD from the first clause of 6:9.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>(NRSV) O tribe and assembly of the city:</strong> There are two main interpretations of the referent(s) of this phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The <em>tribe</em> and the <em>assembly of the city</em> are two distinct groups of people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Listen, O nation, and those assembled in the city! (NET) <em>(NAB, NET, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The <em>tribe</em> and the <em>assembly of the city</em> are one group of people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Listen, tribe of assembled citizens (NJB) <em>(GW, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Either interpretation is acceptable. It is possible that the assembly refers to people from throughout Judah who were gathered in Jerusalem for a feast or other celebration.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>UBS (page 237) proposes that the word “assemble” may suggest that not all the people addressed lived in the city. They may be from smaller towns or villages but gathered in Jerusalem for important occasions.</span></span> It is also possible that Micah expected people from the city to spread his words to others throughout the nation.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>(NRSV) O tribe:</strong> Here Micah addressed the people directly. Some versions have added the word <em>O</em> to make it clear that <em>tribe</em> is a term of address (vocative). Use a vocative that is natural in your language when a person speaks to a group of people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here the word <em>tribe</em> probably refers to the tribe of Judah.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NAC (page 120), UBS (page 237), JFB (page 694), and WBC (page 53).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>(NRSV) the city:</strong> This phrase refers to Jerusalem as in 6:9a.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The phrase “the city” is a reinterpretation of the first word of 6:10. In the Masoretic Text it is the word for “still.” However, in this recommended textual option scholars suggest that the original Hebrew word was “city,” and that it belongs with the phrase “assembly of the city,” which begins in 6:9c. The Hebrew words for “still” and “city” look very similar.</span></span></p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:9a–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to combine and/or reorder these lines.

Here are the two main options:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Hebrew word is a form of <em>nāśag</em>, “to reach,” or “attain to.” Here it means to reach the time for a child to be conceived or born. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You have been conceiving without bearing young, and what you bore I would deliver to the sword. (NJPS) <em>(NJPS, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Hebrew word is a form of <em>sûg</em>, “to remove, carry away.” Here it means “put away” as in storing food or property for safekeeping. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you will store up but never keep safe; what you do keep safe I shall hand over to the sword (NJB) <em>(BSB, ESV, GW, NAB, NASB, NCV, NIV, NJB, NLT, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option/interpretation (1). It has good support from commentators, both traditional and modern.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Waltke 2007 (pages 402–403) cites support in favor of <em>nāsag</em> as the word root from ancient versions, medieval Jewish commentators and modern Jewish exegetes. All interpreted the word in this way. See also NICOT (page 380) and TOTC (pages 216–217).</span></span> Option/interpretation (2) assumes an unattested meaning for the Hebrew word.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Waltke 2007 (pages 402–403) notes that elsewhere the root <em>sûg</em> in the hiphil means “to displace,” always with the object “boundary marker.” The extension of meaning “to remove” an implied object such as goods or articles lacks a parallel. This same point is made by BDB #5381 which states that in hiphil the usual meaning of <em>sûg</em> is “displace or move back a boundary mark.” Micah 6:14 is the only instance in the Old Testament for which this unique meaning is proposed. See also TOTC (pages 216–217).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase is part of a curse on childbirth. It describes the process of pregnancy that normally would result in childbirth.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(REB) but not bring forth:</strong> This phrase is more literally “and/but not you will bring to safety.” There is an interpretation issue with the Hebrew word that the REB translates as <em>bring forth</em>. The same Hebrew word also occurs in 6:14d. Both occurrences are underlined below. Here are the main interpretations:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The word means “bring an infant to safety” as in a safe delivery from a womb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>14c</sup>You will come to labour, but <u>not bring forth</u>; <sup>14d</sup>even if <u>you bear a child</u> I shall give it to the sword (REB) <em>(NJPS, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The word means “bring something to store in safety” as in storing food or treasures in a safe place. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>14c</sup>you will <u>store up</u> but never keep safe; <sup>14d</sup>what <u>you do keep safe</u> I shall hand over to the sword (NJB) <em>(BSB, ESV, GW, NAB, NASB, NCV, NIV, NJB, NLT, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). It has good support from commentators.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Waltke 2007 (pages 402–403), TOTC (pages 216–217), and Pusey (page 87). Waltke 2007 and TOTC both cite Job 21:10 which refers to delivering in birth.</span></span> See also Job 21:10.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase describes the undesirable outcome of the pregnancy. The child is not safely born. Some language groups may have euphemisms to refer to miscarriage or to a stillborn child. Translate this phrase in a culturally appropriate way.</p><h4>6:14d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:14d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and what you save, I will give to the sword.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Even if <span data-bnType=\"implied\">somehow</span> you<sup>(sing/plur)</sup> do bear a child, I will give it to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">an enemy to be killed by</span> the sword.</p></li><li><p>Whatever children you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">manage to</span> have, I will make sure they die in war.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(REB) even if you bear a child I shall give it to the sword:</strong> This clause continues the curse on childbirth from 6:14c. This is a conditional clause. When the condition, <em>you bear a child</em>, is true, the result is that the LORD will give it to the sword.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Verse 6:14c says that no more children will be born. This verse part, 6:14d, describes an imagined situation in which someone was still able to give birth to children. Even if that could happen, the children would nevertheless be killed. See Hosea 9:11–12, 16 for similar curses.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>(REB) give it to the sword:</strong> This expression means to give the child to an enemy to be killed.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Waltke 2007 (page 403) notes that life, not property, is what is given over to the sword.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>(REB) the sword:</strong> This phrase refers to violence and destruction in war.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NAC (page 119).</span></span> Some versions make the context of war explicit without using the word <em>sword</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>I will give it to those who conquer you (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>I will destroy in war (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"></p>",

It may refer to the use of oil as a skin lotion for Asher’s feet.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The way olive oil was extracted at that time was to squeeze olives in an oil press under a heavy beam or to turn them into pulp with a millstone.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NICOT (page 381).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The way wine was made was to stomp with bare feet on grapes in a vat. The juice was collected and fermented to make wine.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>UBS (page 241).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In this verse the Hebrew word for “new wine” is a figure of speech (metonymy) for <em>grapes</em>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Waltke 2007 (page 403) calls it a metonymy of effect. A&amp;F (page 549) suggest that the choice of this word rather than the more correct “grapes” or winepress telescopes the stages of the work.</span></span> Most modern versions translate this word as <em>grapes</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate these phrases:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use a generic word that refers to extracting liquid from fruit, if you have such a word in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You will <u>squeeze</u> oil from the olives…you will <u>squeeze</u> juice from the grapes (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a separate word for each process. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You will <u>press</u> your olives…You will <u>trample</u> the grapes (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Describe the process of making oil and wine in a general way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You will <u>make</u> oil and wine</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but not anoint yourselves with oil…but not drink the wine:</strong> Olive oil and wine were important products at that time. One use of olive oil was as a lotion to rub on skin.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NICOT (page 381).</span></span> The word <em>anoint</em> has that meaning here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but you will have no oil to rub on your bodies (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Wine was especially important in places where water supplies were scarce and impure.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>UBS (page 241).</span></span> Times of wine making were festive occasions. Having an abundance of wine was a cause of joy.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NICOT (page 381).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">These descriptions were vivid, striking ways to express disruption of normal life. It is recommended that you keep these descriptions explicit in your translation if they will be understood.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, in some language groups these products may be unknown. If that is true in your language, another option is to translate these descriptions in a general way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You won’t…use the oil from your olive trees or drink the wine from grapes you grow. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"></p>",

In 6:9–12, the LORD charged the people of Jerusalem and the tribe of Judah with theft, dishonesty, deception, and violence. In 6:13–15, he stated how he will punish them. In 6:16, the LORD restated in a short summary the people’s sin and their punishment. In this section, the LORD was the speaker except for 6:9, in which Micah told the people of the city to listen.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples of section headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Cheating and Violence to Be Punished (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Israel’s Guilt and Punishment (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Accusations and Covenant Curses<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Suggestion by A&amp;F (pages 541–544)</span></span></p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1033006009\" data-endVerseId=\"1033006016\"><h3>Paragraph 6:9–16</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, the LORD accused the people of committing several kinds of sin. Most were sins committed by wealthy people. Some were sins by the general population.</p></div><h4>6:16</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">There are two main ways to interpret the relationship between 6:16 and the previous verses:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Verse 6:16 repeats the main themes of the previous verses in a more concise way. The repeated themes are sin, and the judgment that results. People sinned by following the practices of King Omri and Ahab. As a result the LORD will judge them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>You have kept Omri’s laws and all the practices of the descendants of Ahab</u>, and you have followed their advice. <u>That is why I will ruin you</u>. Your people will be ridiculed. You will bear the disgrace of my people.” (GW) <em>(BSB, GW, NAB, NASB, NET, NIV, NJPS, NLT, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Verse 6:16 gives the reason for the LORD’s judgment described in 6:13–15. The reason for that judgment is that the people followed the practices of Omri and Ahab. The second part of 6:16 announces another judgment. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jerusalem, <u>this will happen because</u> you followed the sinful example of kings Omri and Ahab. <u>Now I will destroy you</u> and your property. Then the people of every nation will make fun and insult you. (CEV) <em>(CEV, ESV, KJV, NCV, NJB, NRSV, REB, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). It has good commentary and version support.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example, JFB (page 694) says that this verse recapitulates what was more fully stated before, Judah’s sin and resulting punishment. See also Mays (page 148) and A&amp;F (pages 549–550).</span></span> It also does not conflict with 6:13a.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Verse 6:13a has two explicit indicators of the reason for the LORD’s judgment that is described in 6:13–15. The word “Therefore” and the phrase “because of your sins” make clear that he will judge the people because of the sins listed in 10–12.</span></span></p><h4>6:16a–c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:16a–c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(combined/reordered)</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You follow the pattern of evil living set by Kings Omri and Ahab and their descendants.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>16a</sup> <u>You have kept</u> <strong>the statutes of Omri</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>16b</sup>and <strong>all the practices of Ahab’s house;</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>16c</sup> <u>you have followed</u> <strong>their counsel.</strong></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">There is an ellipsis (a deliberately omitted phrase) in 6:16b.

The lines in bold have similar meaning and the lines in italics have similar meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1b</sup>For <u>I have become</u> <strong>as when the summer fruit has been gathered</strong>, (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1c</sup> <strong>as when the grapes have been gleaned</strong>: (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1d</sup> <strong>there is no cluster to eat</strong>, (ESV, BSB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1e</sup> <strong>no early fig that I crave</strong>. (BSB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">There is an ellipsis (a deliberately omitted phrase) in 7:1c. In some languages, it may be necessary to supply the missing words from 7:1b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1c</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I have become</span> <strong>as when the grapes have been gleaned</strong>:</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">There are two similes in 7:1b–e. The lines are arranged as a chiasm. Lines 7:1b and 7:1e are parts of a simile about summer fruit. Lines 7:1c and 7:1d are parts of a simile about grapes.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In each simile, Micah compares himself to a person who looks for fruit that is left behind after the fruit harvests are done. In the first simile he looks for summer fruit. In the second simile he looks for grapes.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some versions combine the two similes into one.

The expression <em>lie in wait for blood</em> means “to attack and kill someone.” The expression <em>hunt one another with a net</em> is more literally “each hunts his brother [with] a net.” It compares how a person captured a fellow Israelite to the way a hunter trapped and killed animals.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">These expressions describe the behavior of the people of Israel at that time. The expressions may refer to people who killed others for personal gain. It is also possible that they are hyperboles (exaggerations) that refer to people who took advantage of others to benefit themselves in various ways.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Both ideas are suggested by commentators. KD (page 341) and WBC (page 545) suggest that excessive mistreatment of others may be meant, not necessarily murder. However, UBS (page 245) suggests that “the people are pictured as being so bad that everyone is waiting for a chance to commit murder.” TOTC (page 218) comments that the expression “hunters who lie in wait” means that “their practices are sinister and covert” and the expression “hunt with a net” means that they are “effectively deadly.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate these expressions:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the figures of speech.

The first example shows that the meaning is evil behavior, but not necessarily murder. The second example regards the meaning to be actual murder.

The word <em>day</em> does not refer to a literal 24–hour day. Here it refers to the time when the LORD would punish the people of Israel. The phrase <em>has come</em> indicates that the time had arrived.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>The day for your watchmen:</strong> There is a textual issue about the word <em>watchmen</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Masoretic Text has <em>watchmen</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The day of your watchmen (ESV) <em>(CEV, ESV, GNT, KJV, NAB, NASB, BSB, NCV, NIV, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Some scholars say that the original word was “judgment.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See CBC (page 343).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But your judgment day is coming swiftly now. (NLT) <em>(NLT, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Some scholars say that the original word was “from the north.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Waltke 2007 (page 421).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now from the north their punishment approaches! (NJB) <em>(NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1) along with most versions and commentaries.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">At the time of Micah, a “watchman” or “sentinel” was a person who gave a warning to the residents of a town or city when he saw potential danger. In this verse the word <em>watchmen</em> referred to the prophets. In the past the prophets had warned the people that this time of punishment was coming.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>UBS, KD, and A&amp;F.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate the phrase <em>The day for your watchmen</em>:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Make some aspects of meaning more explicit. Both examples below make explicit that the people were previously warned. The second example also makes explicit the identity of the sentinels/watchmen:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The day that your watchmen <u>warned you about</u> has come. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The day has come when God will punish the people, <u>as he warned them</u> through their watchmen, <u>the prophets</u>. (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the phrase literally and leave the aspects of meaning implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The day of their watchmen, of their punishment, has come. (RSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Leave the entire phrase <em>The day for your watchmen</em> implied. Allow the reference to punishment to provide the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The day of their punishment has come (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But your judgment day is coming swiftly now. Your time of punishment is here (NLT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>your:</strong> In 7:4a–b and 7:4d Micah uses the pronouns “them” and “their” to talk about the people. He used the pronoun <em>your</em> in this line and in 7:5 to address the people directly.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some commentators propose that a change of speaker and/or addressee occurs here. For example, A&amp;F suggest that the speaker is the LORD and the addressee is the people. NICOT proposes that the speaker is Micah and the addressee is the LORD. These notes will follow the suggestion of UBS, NAC, KD and Waltke 2007, all of whom regard Micah to be the speaker and the addressee to be the people.</span></span> In Hebrew poetry, it is common for an author to alternate pronouns in this way, even though the pronoun referent remains the same.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">One way that versions reduce the potential confusion to readers is to reduce the number of times the pronouns alternate. For example, the NRSV has “their” in this line to match the other pronouns in 7:4. The NIV does it differently. It has “you/your” in this line and in 7:4d:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>4c</sup>The day God visits <u>you</u> has come, the day <u>your</u> watchmen sound the alarm. <sup>4d</sup>Now is the time of <u>your</u> confusion. (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use the most natural and least confusing way in your language to translate the pronouns in this verse.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the day of your visitation:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase is literally “your visitation.” Here the phrase means “the LORD’s judgment of the people.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT (electronic edition, page 958), BDB #6486 (page 824). Waltke 2007 (page 421) calls the phrase “a metonymy for judgment.” Also see Davis, NAC, and CBC.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>your doom (NJPS)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>your judgment day…Your time of punishment (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>7:4d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:4d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Now is the time of their confusion.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Now a time will begin when you will be terrified/confused.</p></li><li><p>and it will be a time of panic/confusion.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Now is the time of their confusion:</strong> This line means that the punishment from the LORD will cause confusion among the people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Now:</strong> This word indicates “at that time.” Here are some other ways to translate it:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Then (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>That will be when (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>is the time:</strong> This phrase is not in the Hebrew text. It is an expression in English that the BSB and some other versions supply. It reinforces that the time of punishment would happen at that time. If this expression is not natural in your language, it is best to leave it untranslated.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>confusion:</strong> This word refers to chaos or disorder or panic that results from an attack by an enemy.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NAC, Davis, and CBC.</span></span> The LORD probably allowed this kind of attack as his means of punishment.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"></p>",

In 7:1–6, he talked about the wickedness of the people using a combination of figures of speech and direct speech. In 7:7, he concluded the lament by expressing his own hope in the LORD.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some scholars and versions place 7:7 in the next section. However, expressions of both sorrow and hope are features in some other laments, such as in the Psalms.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Psalm 55 is one example. NICOT (pages 383–385).</span></span> Also, both 7:1 and 7:7 have first-person pronouns and verbs that enclose third-person descriptions in 7:2–6.

It was because members of their own households were their enemies.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Micah gives three examples. In each example he describes a relationship between a member of a family to another member. In each relationship the younger member behaves in a way that dishonors and opposes the authority of an older family member. Each was an example of a serious offense in that society.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>ZIBBC (page 144).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">The examples use singular forms: “son,” “daughter,” “daughter-in-law,” etc. However, each phrase represents a large group of people: “sons,” “daughters,” “daughters-in-law,” etc. In some languages it will be more natural to use plural forms. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Sons refuse to respect their own fathers, daughters rebel against their own mothers, daughters-in-law despise their mothers-in-law. (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>7:6a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:6a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For a son dishonors his father,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For a son has contempt for his father,</p></li><li><p>Because sons insult their fathers,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> This word introduces a reason for Micah’s warnings in 7:5. See the previous note for more explanation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions indicate the connection of this verse to the previous ones in a different way. For example, the GNT refers back to the time period that is described in 7:1–5:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>In these times</u> sons treat their fathers like fools (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other versions do not have an explicit connecting word or phrase. Instead they leave the connection implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>A son treats his father with contempt (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a son dishonors his father:</strong> In Hebrew, the word <em>dishonors</em> is related to the word for “fool.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In Hebrew, the word <em>nābal</em> means “fool.” Here the participle of the word, <em>mǝnabbēl</em> is used.</span></span> In this clause the word means that the son insults and/or dishonors his father by treating him like a fool.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Mounce (page 990), BDB #5034 (page 614), NAC, KD, and Waltke 2007.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>A son will not honor his father (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>For son insults father (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>For a son thinks his father is a fool (NET)</p></blockquote><h4>7:5–6</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:5–6\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(combined/reordered)</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Sons disrespect their fathers, daughters rebel against their mothers, and daughters-in-law defy their mothers-in-law.

(GW) <em>(CEV, GNT, GW, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The phrase refers to all the males in a household.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This interpretation is favored by Waltke 2007. The MT word “people” in the phrase “people of his own household” is masculine plural. This gender marking is compatible with the interpretation of “males” here. However, this form alone is not conclusive evidence. The masculine plural form did not necessarily mean males only. It was also the standard form used to designate a mixed group of males and females.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A man’s enemies are the men of his own household (NASB) <em>(KJV, NASB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The phrase refers to the servants in a household.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This interpretation is favored by Margolis and KD.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a man’s enemies are his own servants (NET) <em>(NET)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions are ambiguous. They translate the word <em>household</em> literally which leaves implied the referents of the word. However, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). It best fits the context of the three relationships described in this verse.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The examples in the verse include both male and female relationships among family members. The wider context supports this view also. See Jesus’ quote of this verse in Luke 12:51–53 and Matthew 10:35.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">This line is probably a summary statement that refers to the relationships described in 7:6a–c.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>enemies:</strong> This word refers to people hostile towards others, “foe.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDB #340 (page 33), Mounce (page 892).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a person’s enemies will be members of his own family (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Your family is now your enemy (CEV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 7:5–6</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to combine and/or reorder the verses.

However, both words have a collective reference to a group of people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>UBS (page 250).</span></span> In some languages, it may be more natural to translate these words with plural forms. See the GNT example above.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Based on 7:8b, the enemy was probably a literal city or nation whose army had defeated the city of Jerusalem. In Hebrew, the word enemy is feminine. However, use the gender that is natural in your language to refer to an enemy city or nation.</p><h4>7:8b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>8b</sup> <u>Though I have fallen,</u> <strong>I will arise;</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>8c</sup> <u>though I sit in darkness,</u> <strong>the LORD will be my light.</strong></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In each line, the underlined part states a negative situation. The part in bold print states a positive outcome. Together, these lines give the reason why the speaker (Jerusalem) tells the enemy not to rejoice. It is because the city will not remain destroyed. The LORD will bring restoration and salvation.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Though I have fallen…though I sit:</strong> In this verse, both phrases refer to a past event, the defeat of the city by an enemy. However, the same phrases can apply to other, future negative situations also.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate these phrases:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate in a way that refers to the situation in Jerusalem at that time.

The enemy had previously taunted the people. But after the LORD saves them, the enemy will be shamed and disgraced.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>UBS, Pusey, ABC, and TOTC.</span></span> Throughout this verse, the NIV and some versions use singular pronouns and nouns, such as “my enemy.” Other versions, such as the REB, use plural forms such as “my enemies” (7:10a). In some languages, it may be confusing to use singular forms when the topic is the inhabitants and “the enemy” is a group of soldiers. If that is the case in your language, you should use plural forms.</p><h4>7:10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Then my enemy will see</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Then my enemy will see it <span data-bnType=\"implied\">too</span>,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You</span><sup>(plur)</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">,</span> our<sup>(excl)</sup> enemies, will see <span data-bnType=\"implied\">him rescue us</span><sup>(excl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with your</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">own eyes</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Then my enemy will see:</strong> This line refers back to the LORD’s vindication in 7:9. In Hebrew, the word <em>see</em> is used once in 7:9 and twice in this verse, with both literal and figurative meanings. Here the enemy will literally <em>see</em> with her own eyes that the LORD saves his people. The enemy will also <em>see</em> figuratively. She will “know” that the LORD is able to save his people, contrary to her taunt.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Then:</strong> This time word introduces the next event after the LORD’s vindication in 7:9e.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>When</u> my enemies see it (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>my enemy:</strong> See the note on “my enemy” in 7:8a.

The phrase <em>who said to me</em> introduces the words that the enemy spoke to Jerusalem. In some languages it may be unnatural or confusing to use a relative pronoun here. Some of the examples at the end of this note show other translation options.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The question, <em>“Where is the LORD your God?”</em> is rhetorical. The expected answer of the question is “Nowhere.” The rhetorical question implied either that the LORD was not real or that he had no power to save them. The purpose of the question was to taunt or mock the LORD and the people of Jerusalem.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>UBS, NAC, NICOT, A&amp;F, and ABC.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this line:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Make explicit the referent of the relative pronoun, <em>who</em>.

This understanding is supported by NAC and JFB and is followed by most versions. Waltke 2007 (page 436) proposes that the referent of “her” is “his righteousness.” The difficulty with his proposal is that it does not fit well with the context of the rest of the verse.</span></span> There are two main interpretations of this verse part:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means that the people of Jerusalem will witness the downfall of the enemy. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>With my own eyes I will see their downfall (NLT) <em>(BSB, CEV, ESV, GNT, GW, KJV, NAB, NASB, NIV, NJB, NJPS, NLT, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means that the people of Jerusalem will take pleasure in the downfall of the enemy.

In Hebrew, the attitude of the people of Jerusalem is not made explicit here. It is best to leave it implied.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>My eyes:</strong> This phrase may refer to literal eyes. However, the phrase is also a Hebrew expression for “I,” the one who sees. Some versions translate it as “I.” Either translation is acceptable. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>I</u> shall be watching (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The word “downfall” is supplied by several versions to make explicit what Jerusalem will see. The phrase “be trampled” means “defeat” or a change from a high to a low status. This kind of misfortune is indicated by the description in 10d–e.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate 7:10c:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate literally. Leave implied what the eyes will see. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My eyes will look on her (NASB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Supply the word downfall or another word with a similar meaning.

These versions may base their translations on a more metaphorical understanding of the clause, which has a wider reference beyond the city. This could be correct as a prophetic, secondary application of the meaning to a future time. However, it is recommended that the plain meaning of the Hebrew text be translated here.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>The day:</strong> In Hebrew, the word <em>day</em> means “day” or “time.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDB #3117 (page 399).</span></span> There are two main interpretations of the day or time indicated in this clause:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The day for building walls is left implied. It may or may not be the same day as the downfall of the enemy in 7:10. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The time will come when your walls will be built again (NCV) <em>(CEV, ESV, GNT, GW, KJV, NCV, NIV, NJPS, NRSV, BSB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The day for building walls is the same day as the downfall of the enemy in 7:10.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Waltke 2007 (page 437) suggests that the time in view is specified by the Hebrew word for “now” in 7:10.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>That will be the day for rebuilding your walls! (NJB) <em>(NAB, NASB, NET, NJB, NLT, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with a majority of English versions. In Hebrew, the specific day is not made explicit here. It is best to leave it implied.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>rebuilding:</strong> In Hebrew, this word can mean either “build” or “rebuild.” Here the word may be used in a general way that refers to either action. Either translation is acceptable. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It is the day for building your walls (NAB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It will be a day for rebuilding your walls (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your walls:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase has a collective singular pronoun <em>your</em><sup>(sing)</sup>. This form suggests that the city of Jerusalem is the addressee. However, the addressee, “city of Jerusalem,” actually refers to the people of Jerusalem.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>UBS (pages 253–254).</span></span> Some versions make this information explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>People of Jerusalem, the time to rebuild… (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be unnatural for a person to address a city. In those languages, this (GNT) translation example may be a good option to follow.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>walls:</strong> In Hebrew, the word <em>walls</em> means a “wall,” “fence,” “wall made of loose stones from the field without mortar.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Mounce (page 912).</span></span> The word usually refers to a stone wall around a vineyard or other property.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This meaning is favored by A&amp;F, KD, TOTC, and Pusey.</span></span> Some scholars propose that the word refers here to the walls that surround the city of Jerusalem.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NAC (page 129) and NICOT (pages 396–397) propose that the reference here is to the city walls of Jerusalem. NAC bases this proposal on the word pointing to a metaphorical use, to refer to restoration of the Jews to Judah and Jerusalem.</span></span> However, it is possible that more than one kind of wall is meant. For that reason, it is recommended that you leave the specific referent implied in your translation. Some examples are the BSB and the two examples under the previous note on “rebuilding.”</p><h4>7:11a–b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:11a–b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(combined/reordered)</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The day for rebuilding your walls and extending your borders is coming.

All the versions listed under interpretation (1) leave the identity of the people implied. These versions translate the word <em>they</em> either as <em>they</em> or as “people.” The implied reference could be either “Gentiles,” “Jewish exiles,” or both groups.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to you:</strong> The referent of <em>you</em> in this phrase is probably the city of Jerusalem as in the phrase “your walls” in 7:11a.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The context of the paragraph suggests that the city of Jerusalem remains the referent here. However, in Hebrew, the pronoun <em>you</em> is masculine singular here, but is feminine singular in 7:11a. This difference in form is probably stylistic in nature.</span></span> See the note there for more details.</p><h4>7:12b–e</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the similarity between these parallel lines:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12b</sup> <u>from Assyria</u> <strong>and the cities of Egypt</strong>,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12c</sup>even <u>from Egypt</u> <strong>to the Euphrates</strong>,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12d</sup> <u>from sea</u> <strong>to sea</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12e</sup>and <u>mountain</u> <strong>to mountain</strong>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Each of these four lines describes a separate large region.

For example, the GNT translates it this way, “Your people will return to you from everywhere….” See also TOTC (page 223). However, it is uncertain that these lines are figurative. For that reason it is not recommended that you follow this interpretation.</span></span> If readers are unfamiliar with these places, it may be helpful to include a map.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>from…to:</strong> In Hebrew, these words, used together, are an expression that indicates the boundaries of an area.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>DCH (page 343) gives the example “from Dan to Beer-sheba” in Judges 20:1.</span></span> In Hebrew, the word <em>from</em> means “from/from out of” a place.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>DCH (page 343) and Waltke 2007 (page 439).</span></span> In Hebrew, the word <em>to</em> means “to/as far as” a place.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>DCH (page 343).</span></span> The place names of each boundary are also part of the expression, as shown in each of the examples above.</p><h4>7:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>from Assyria and the cities of Egypt,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the region that extends from</span> Assyria to Egypt</p></li><li><p>They will travel from the countries of Egypt and Assyria <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and in-between</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>from Assyria and the cities of Egypt:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In Hebrew, the word <em>māṣôr</em> “Egypt” is a less common, poetic name of Egypt.

He also prayed that the people in those nations would respond by acknowledging the greatness of the LORD.</p><h4>7:16a–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>16a</sup>The nations will <u>see and be ashamed,</u> deprived of all their might.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>16b</sup>They will <u>put their hands over their mouths</u>,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>16c</sup>and their <u>ears will become deaf.</u></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In these lines, Micah prayed that the marvelous things, which the LORD would show the nations, would have strong impact on them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some versions translate these lines in a way that more clearly indicates a prayer.

The phrase <em>be ashamed, deprived of all their might</em> implies a comparison to the might of the LORD. The nations would feel shame because the power of the LORD showed how weak they really were.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this line:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When the nations see those miracles, they will no longer brag about their power.

They included Israel’s enemies.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Waltke 2007 (page 442) suggests that these were pagan people, in contrast to the LORD’s people. Also, UBS and Pusey.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>see:</strong> In Hebrew, this word means “see” or “realize.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Mounce (page 1037).</span></span> In this context the word probably had both meanings. The word <em>see</em> had a literal meaning because they would see miracles of the LORD with their own eyes. The word also had a figurative meaning because they would realize how weak they were by comparison.</p><h4>7:16b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:16b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>They will put their hands over their mouths, and their ears will become deaf.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">In shock</span> they will cover their mouths and be deaf <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to the sounds around them</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">In dismay</span> they will be unable to speak or hear.</p></li><li><p>May they be struck with shock and awe.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>They will put their hands over their mouths, and their ears will become deaf:</strong> In Hebrew, it is common to refer to attitudes and emotions by mentioning parts of the body (mouths, ears) that are associated with those attitudes and emotions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The gesture of laying a hand over a mouth and the description of deaf ears are probably two ways of indicating the emotional effect that the power of the LORD had on the nations. This would include humiliation, shock, awe, and other emotions that the nations felt.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TOTC (page 224) proposes that these expressions signify their humiliation. Davis (page 159) suggests shock and wonder. NAC (page 132) suggests awe and amazement. See also EBC, ABC and UBS for similar proposals.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The gesture of a person covering their mouth probably describes a literal action with symbolic meaning.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>UBS (page 259).</span></span> However, the description of their ears being deaf was probably not meant literally.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NET footnote on these lines suggests that the opposing nations will be left dumbfounded by the LORD’s power. Their inability to respond will make them appear to be deaf mutes. KD (page 347) cite Job 26:14 “who can understand the thunder of his power.” This verse in Job does not mention deaf ears. However, the expression “their ears will be deaf” may describe the same kind of impact on a person that Job experienced. The expression may express their inability to comprehend the greatness of his awesome power.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages these references to parts of the body may not have the same meaning as they do in Hebrew. If that is true in your language, here are some other ways to translate 7:16b–c:</p><p data-indent=\"1\"></p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Make the meaning of the references to body parts more explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They will cover their mouths <u>in silent awe</u>, deaf <u>to everything around them</u>. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>In dismay</u> they will close their mouths and cover their ears. (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Substitute different body part expressions that have the same meaning in your language. Make the meaning explicit if helpful. Include a footnote that describes the Hebrew gesture. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>May their livers fail and their kidneys be in dismay because of their great shame</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>footnote: In Hebrew: “they will lay their hands on their mouths, their ears will be deaf.”</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning directly.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>17b</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">They will lick the dust</span> <strong>like reptiles slithering on the ground</strong>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In these lines, Micah continued to pray about the effect of the LORD’s marvelous deeds on the nations. These lines are parallel similes. In each simile Micah compared the nations to animals that slid or crawled on the ground. The similarity is that the nations and the animals would both “lick the dust.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Genesis 3:14.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some versions translate these lines in a way that more clearly indicates a prayer. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Let them lick dust like snakes, like crawling things on the ground! (NJPS)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>They will lick the dust:</strong> In Hebrew, the phrase <em>lick the dust</em> was a figure of speech that meant humiliation in defeat.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Waltke 2007, NAC, A&amp;F, ABC, and JFB.</span></span> The leader of a defeated enemy would lie prostrate and kiss the feet of the one who defeated him.

In Hebrew, the word translated as <em>reptiles slithering</em> means “to crawl or glide like a snake.” The phrase <em>reptiles slithering on the ground</em> may refer to a snake, reptile, or worm.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Mounce (page 926) says “crawl, glide (of a snake).” Also, Waltke 2007 (page 443).

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Let them be humiliated by their defeat</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>7:17c–e</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning (these lines are from the NRSV, which follows the interpretation that the Notes recommend for understanding the structure of these lines):</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>17c</sup> <u>They shall come trembling out of their fortresses</u></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>17d</sup> <u>they shall turn in dread</u> <strong>to the Lord our God</strong>;</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>17e</sup> <u>and they shall stand in fear</u> <strong>of you</strong>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In these lines, Micah prayed that the nations would fear and submit themselves to the LORD. The first line implies that the nations would present themselves before him. The second and third lines talk about their submission to him. Each line says in a different way that the nations would fear him.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some versions translate these lines in a way that more clearly indicates a prayer. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Let them come trembling out of their strongholds to the Lord our God; Let them fear and dread You! (NJPS)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">There is an interpretation issue in 17c–d about the line to which the phrase “to the Lord our God” belongs. The parallel lines are more literally “they will quake from their strongholds to Yahweh our God. They will be in dread and they will be afraid from you.” These are the two interpretations:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The phrase “to the Lord our God” belongs to 17d. The LORD is the one they will dread.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In Hebrew, the phrase “to Yahweh our God” is the first (fronted) part of the line, which gives it emphasis. Davis (page 159) and Waltke 2007 (page 444).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>To the Lord our God they will come in dread (NASB) <em>(ESV, GNT, GW, KJV, NASB, NIV, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The phrase “to the Lord our God” belongs to 17c.

The phrase <em>the remnant</em> is another way to say <em>His inheritance</em>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Favored by Waltke 2007 (page 444), who suggests that the word “remnant” is in apposition to “his inheritance.” The two words refer to the same people, the remnant, that is, his inheritance. This interpretation fits the following context well. For example, 7:20 refers to God’s promise to be faithful to Jacob and Abraham, the ancestors of all the people of Israel.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who pardons the guilt of the remnant, overlooking the sins of his special people (NLT)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The parallel lines suggest that Micah described the same group of people in two ways.</span></span> <em>(NLT)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The GW may also follow this interpretation.

The first part, 7:14–17, contains prayers to the LORD for the restoration of his people and the defeat of their enemies. The second part, 18–20, is a hymn of praise to the LORD for his compassion and his faithful relationship with Israel. These Notes and the Display will assume that the main speaker is Micah, who speaks as a representative of the people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This suggestion is favored by EBC, JFB, TOTC, Mangum, and Waltke 2007. Commentators who suggest that the speaker is the people, collectively, include Achtemeier, NICOT, WBC, and UBS.</span></span> However, in 7:15 and in 18–20 there are brief changes of speaker and/or addressee. See the notes under paragraph 7:14–17 and under paragraph 7:18–20 for more detailed discussion.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples of section headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Prayer and Praise (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lord’s compassion on Israel (NLT)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1033007018\" data-endVerseId=\"1033007020\"><h3>Paragraph 7:18–20</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, the subject changes. In 7:14–17, the subject was the nations’ response to the marvelous things that the LORD would do. In this paragraph, the subject is the character of the LORD and his relationship to Israel.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The literary form of this paragraph is probably a hymn.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Waltke 2007 (page 444).</span></span> Micah is the speaker. He represents people of Israel who believe in the LORD. In this hymn, the addressee alternates between the LORD and the people. In 7:18a–c, Micah addresses the LORD. In 7:18d–19b, he addresses the people. In 7:19c–7:20, he again addresses the LORD. The main themes are God’s love and his forgiveness of sin.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some versions place a heading here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s Compassion and Steadfast Love (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No One is Like God (CEV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>7:20a–b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:20a–b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>You will show faithfulness to Jacob and loving devotion to Abraham,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You<sup>(sing)</sup> will be true to Jacob and show love to Abraham,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We</span><sup>(excl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">know that</span> you will be faithful <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to keep the covenant with</span> Abraham and Jacob</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>20a</sup> <u>You will show faithfulness</u> <strong>to Jacob</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>20b</sup>and <u>loving devotion</u> <strong>to Abraham</strong>,</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">There is an ellipsis (a deliberately omitted phrase) in 7:20b. In some languages, it may be necessary to supply the missing words from 7:20a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>17b</sup>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you will show</span> <u>loving devotion</u> <strong>to Abraham</strong>,</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In these lines, Micah expresses his confidence that the LORD will show his faithfulness and loyalty to Jacob and Abraham. The lines refer to the promise he made to Abraham and Jacob to be faithful to his covenant with them.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Waltke 2007, NAC, and EBC.</span></span> The implication is that the LORD would be faithful and loyal to the descendants of these patriarchs as well.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>JFB and EBC.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some versions make this implied information explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You will show your faithfulness and constant love to your people, the descendants of Abraham and of Jacob, as you promised our ancestors long ago. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>faithfulness…loving devotion:</strong> In Hebrew, these words have a similar meaning. This pair of words often occurs in other verses of the Old and New Testaments. For example, Exodus 34:6 “steadfast love and faithfulness” and John 1:7 “grace and truth.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A&amp;F (page 599) considers the two words to be hendiadys for “reliable mercy.”</span></span> In this verse, the word <em>faithfulness</em> means that the LORD is “reliable.” He keeps every promise.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDB #571 (page 54), CBC, and JFB.</span></span> The word <em>loving devotion</em> means that the LORD shows love by keeping his covenant.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDB #2617 (page 339), NAC, and CBC.</span></span> The same Hebrew word is used in 7:18d. See the note there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate these words:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>loyal…loyal love (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>faithfulness…unfailing love (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>keep your word…be faithful (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Jacob…Abraham:</strong> These are two important ancestors in the history of Israel. The LORD made his covenant with Abraham and reaffirmed it to Jacob.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>EBC and CBC.

However, in this context, the meaning is probably not a duration of time, but a point in time.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Waltke 2007 (pages 448–449).</span></span> It was the time in the distant past when the special relationship between the LORD and the people of Israel began. It is recommended that you translate this phrase in a way that indicates a point in time rather than a duration. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as you promised our ancestors many years ago (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate the phrase <em>the days of old</em>:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in ancient times (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>long ago (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in days gone by (REB)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 7:20a–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural to combine and/or reorder these lines.
