It tells us that this book was a message from the LORD to his people through the prophet Hosea. It also tells when Hosea received this message from the LORD.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In Hebrew, this first verse serves as a title for the whole book.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Andersen and Freedman (pages 142–149).</span></span> Most English versions have a separate book title, such as “Hosea,” followed directly by 1:1. There are two ways to show the relationship of 1:1 to the rest of the book:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Place a section heading before 1:1. Here are some other examples of section headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The beginning of the book</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The LORD gave a message to Hosea</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Do not place any heading before 1:1.

It is implied that Hosea would make this message known by his words or actions to the people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this line:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This is the message which the Lord gave Hosea son of Beeri…. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This book contains the words/message that God made known to Hosea the son of Beeri</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>LORD:</strong> The word <em>LORD</em> represents the Hebrew word “Yahweh,” the personal name of God. In Hebrew, this is a proper name, not a title or general noun. See the discussion of Yahweh, the LORD in the Introduction.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to Hosea son of Beeri:</strong> See the discussion of The author in the Introduction.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The writer introduced himself in the third person, as if he were speaking about someone else. The writers of the New Testament letters did this also. Most English versions keep the third person forms. However, if this would be confusing for your readers, you could reword it using “I…me.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I am Hosea son of Beeri. This is the message that God gave to me during…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you use “I” or “me” in this verse, you will need to make the same change in some of the verses that follow. For example, in 1:3, the CEV has:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So I married Gomer (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>son of Beeri:</strong> In languages that do not use specific terms for <em>son</em> or “daughter,” you may use a general term. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>child of Beeri</p></blockquote><h4>1:1a–c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1a–c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>combined/reordered</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ During the time that Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah ruled in Judah, and Jeroboam the son of Jehoash ruled in Israel, Yahweh spoke this message to Hosea the son of Beeri.</p></li></ul></div><h4>1:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>while Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah were kings of Judah.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yahweh made these words known</span> during the time when Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah ruled as kings of Judah,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yahweh spoke these words</span> during the time when Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah ruled as kings <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the country</span> of Judah,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah:</strong> This is a list of the kings of the southern kingdom of Judah who ruled one after the other.

Use an order that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In chapters 1–3, Hosea’s relationship with Gomer illustrates the LORD’s relationship to his people, the Israelites. Hosea married Gomer, but she was not faithful to him. Instead, she left him and lived with other men. In a similar way, the LORD had made an agreement with the people of Israel that he would be their God and they should worship only him. But they were not faithful to obey that agreement. Instead, they turned away from him and worshiped false gods. The LORD punished Israel because of their unfaithfulness, but eventually he was merciful and restored their relationship. In a similar way, Hosea was merciful to Gomer and restored their relationship.</p></div>",

The word <em>Go</em> serves primarily to introduce the second command. It may emphasize the need for Hosea to take action. It does not imply that Hosea should first go on a journey and then marry someone.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDB (#1980) and HALOT (#2289) both list various ways in which the Hebrew root <em>hlk</em> can be used in combination with other verbs. Some of the verses listed (such as 1 Samuel 9:9, Isaiah 2:3, and Genesis 19:32) have combinations such as “Come, let us go” or “Come, let us make our father drink…” (In these verses “come” is a translation of Hebrew <em>hlk</em>.) These combinations focus attention on the following action. Andersen and Freedman (page 156) understand a similar use of the verb “go” here. They say specifically that “it does not imply a journey.” They point to 1 Kings 1:12, where Nathan said to Bath-Sheba, “Go, let me counsel you, although he clearly wanted her to stay and hear his counsel.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this kind of double command:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a word or phrase that directs attention to the main command to get married. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Go marry… (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What I want you to do is to get married to…</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the main command to get married. Leave a word or phrase such as <em>Go</em> implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Marry… (GW)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate these commands in a way that is clear and natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a prostitute as your wife:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>a prostitute as your wife</em> is literally “a wife/woman of immoralities.” The Hebrew word “immoralities” refers to sexual activity that is contrary to God’s law. It includes both adultery and sexual relations between unmarried people. Some forms of this word refer to prostitution, that is, offering to have sexual intercourse for pay.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In this context, the plural form “immoralities” indicates repeated or habitual behavior.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Biblical Hebrew Reference Grammar for Students, NET footnote, Stuart, HALOT (#2529), and McComiskey (page 14). HALOT defines the plural form in this context as “inclined to fornicate.”</span></span> There are two main ways to interpret this phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The LORD told Hosea to <u>marry a woman who had already engaged in sexual relations contrary to God’s law. She may have been a prostitute</u>. People knew about her immoral character before her marriage to Hosea.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This interpretation is supported by Keil (page 37), McComiskey (page 14), and Pusey (page 20).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Go and marry a prostitute (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Go marry a promiscuous woman (NIV2011) <em>(BSB, CEV, GW, NET, NIV2011, NJB, NLT, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The LORD told Hosea to <u>marry a woman who would be unfaithful to him after their marriage</u>. Her promiscuous character would develop or become clear only after she became his wife.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Andersen and Freedman (pages 157–167), Macintosh (page 8), and Wood (page 166). Andersen and Freedman present evidence that this expression cannot refer to an unmarried prostitute. It can only mean a married woman who is promiscuous. They suggest that Hosea’s wife only became an adulteress after marriage but that the verse is speaking about that future state as if it had already occurred. (The technical term for this is prolepsis, a literary device that is fairly common in prophesies.) McComiskey (pages 11–14) argues against this evidence and points out some of the weaknesses of the proleptic view.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Go and get married; your wife will be unfaithful (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Go marry a woman who will commit adultery. <em>(GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions translate the Hebrew phrase “wife/woman of immoralities” quite literally. For example, the KJV, ESV, NJPS, and NRSV have “wife of whoredom(s).” The NASB has “wife of harlotry.” These expressions can refer to more than one interpretation, so the Notes have not listed them under either one.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In addition to these versions, the NIV has “an adulterous wife” which could imply that Gomer was already married to someone else and was committing adultery. Similarly, the NCV translation “an unfaithful woman” would normally refer to someone’s wife, not to an unmarried woman. But there is no evidence that Gomer was already married to a different man, and the commentaries used in preparing these Notes did not suggest this as a possible interpretation, so the Notes have not listed these versions under any particular interpretation.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most English versions. However, both interpretations have good commentary support. So it is also recommended that you mention interpretation (2) in a footnote. You may also want to mention interpretation (2) for the next phrase (“children of unfaithfulness”) in the same footnote, because the two interpretations correspond to each other.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and have children of adultery:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase is literally “and children of immoralities.” There are three main interpretations of this phrase:<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A fourth interpretation is that Gomer had some children who were conceived as a result of her prostitution before Hosea married her. After her marriage, she had three more children with Hosea. See McComiskey (page 15). This interpretation is not explicitly followed in any of the English versions cited in Translator’s Notes. The BSB (“children of adultery”) is ambiguous, so it has not been listed under any interpretation.</span></span></p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The children born to Gomer and Hosea would <u>be</u> born to an immoral mother. <u>Nothing is indicated about the behavior of the children</u>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Chisholm (page 1380). The expression “children of immoralities” is understood in the same way as similar expressions in the OT. “Children of old age” means “children born to an elderly parent,” so “children of immoralities” means “children born to an immoral mother.”</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and have children with her (NIV2011) <em>(CEV, GW, NIV2011, NJB, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The children born to Gomer and Hosea would be <u>like their mother in their behavior and character</u>. The immoral character of each would become evident in the future.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Wood (page 170).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and your children will be just like her (GNT) <em>(GNT, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The children born to Gomer after her marriage would <u>be a result of her adultery. Hosea would not be their father</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a prostitute who will bear illegitimate children conceived through prostitution (NET) <em>(NET, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The first and second interpretations are more likely than the third, since the rest of the chapter seems to indicate that Hosea is the father of these children. See 1:3, 1:6, 1:8.</span></span></p><h4>1:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because this land is flagrantly prostituting itself by departing from the LORD.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Do</span><sup>(sing)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">this</span> because the people of Israel <span data-bnType=\"implied\">are also unfaithful</span>. They repeatedly commit prostitution by forsaking Yahweh <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to follow other gods</span>.”</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Marry such a woman</span> to show the people of Israel that they have sinned like a completely unfaithful/immoral wife. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yes,</span> they have left me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in order to follow other gods</span>.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because:</strong> In Hebrew, this word introduces the reason that the LORD commanded Hosea to marry “a woman of immoralities.” The reason is that his marriage to an unfaithful wife would illustrate the LORD’s relationship to his unfaithful people, the Israelites.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions translate this word as “for” or <em>because</em>. Other versions leave it implied. Use a natural way in your language to introduce the LORD’s reason for his command to Hosea. In some languages, it may be necessary to make more information explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This will illustrate how Israel… (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Do that, because it will show how the people in this land…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>this land:</strong> Here the term <em>this land</em> is a figure of speech (metonymy). It represents the people who lived in the land, that is, the Israelites.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this figure of speech:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the people in this country (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>my people (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>is flagrantly prostituting itself:</strong> In Hebrew, this expression refers here to committing sexual immorality or behaving as a prostitute. It is used here as a figure of speech (metaphor). In this metaphor, the people of Israel are compared to a wife who is repeatedly unfaithful to her husband, because they had stopped worshiping the LORD and begun to worship other gods. See the General Comment on 1:2c for other ways to translate this figure of speech.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The form of the Hebrew expression emphasizes the extent of their immorality. It may imply several things:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>They repeatedly or continually commit immoral acts.</p></li><li><p>They are openly, brazenly, or flagrantly immoral.</p></li><li><p>Their immoral behavior is vile, extreme, or of the worst kind.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to express this emphasis:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>have been completely unfaithful (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>continually commit adultery</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>openly committing adultery (NLT96)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You should express this emphasis in a way that is appropriate in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by departing from the LORD:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase is literally “from after the LORD.” By worshiping other gods, the people of Israel had abandoned the LORD. To make the meaning clear, English translations supply a verb such as <em>departing</em> (BSB), “forsaking” (NRSV), “abandon” (GW), “turning away” (NET). You may also have to supply additional words to make the meaning clear in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the LORD:</strong> The LORD referred to himself in the third person, <em>the LORD</em>, as if he were speaking about someone else. This was good style in Old Testament Hebrew. In some languages, it may be more natural to use the pronoun “me” to make it explicit that the LORD is referring to himself. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the people in this land have abandoned <u>me</u>, <u>the LORD</u>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to avoid confusion is to use only the pronoun “me.” It may not be necessary to repeat the words <em>the LORD</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>my people have left <u>me</u> and become unfaithful. (GNT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:2c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The phrase “in departing from the LORD” explains the meaning of the figure of speech “vilest adultery” in nonfigurative language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other ways to express these two phrases:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Change the phrase “vilest adultery” into a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it is like the people of this land are being totally immoral, because they have turned their backs on me, the LORD.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Place the nonfigurative phrase “in departing from the LORD” first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the people of this land have abandoned the LORD. They are like a woman who repeatedly commits adultery.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Combine the two phrases into one phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the people in this country have been completely unfaithful to the Lord (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ul></div>",

Use a natural way in your language to introduce a result.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Hosea went and married:</strong> The Hebrew verbs that the BSB translates as <em>Hosea went and married</em> are literally “he went and he took.” These repeat the verbs of the LORD’s command to Hosea in 1:2b, “Go, take.” Many English versions follow the Hebrew pattern of repeating the same verbs in both places. For example, the RSV has “Go and take” for the command in 1:2b and “he went and took” in 1:3. Other versions have “marry” in both places.

It would also warn them that the LORD was going to punish Jehu’s descendants for what he had done.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the bloodshed of Jezreel:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase is literally “the blood of Jezreel.” It refers to the murders that Jehu committed at <em>Jezreel</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the bloodshed at Jezreel (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the people they killed at Jezreel (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the murders he committed in Jezreel Valley (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be necessary to make explicit that Jehu committed the murders.

Many English versions do this. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Name her Lo-Ruhamah (NCV) <em>Here is the NCV footnote:</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>[Lo-Ruhamah] This name in Hebrew means “not pitied.” (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Write both the Hebrew name and the meaning in the translation. If you do this, avoid giving the impression that the LORD explained the meaning of the name to Hosea. The GW uses brackets to accomplish this. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Name her Lo Ruhamah [Unloved].</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">If your readers are not familiar with this use of brackets, the first two options may be preferable to this one.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The names of Gomer’s next two children are discussed in 1:9a and 2:23b–c.

Introduce this two-part reason in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will no longer have compassion on the house of Israel:</strong> This is the first reason that the LORD told Hosea to name his daughter Lo-ruhamah. The name will indicate to them that the LORD will no longer show them love or mercy.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>have compassion:</strong> This is the verb in Hebrew from which Lo-ruhamah’s name is derived. You should translate this phrase with the same word or phrase that you used to describe the meaning of Lo-ruhamah’s name. For example, if you said that her name means “Not <u>pitied</u>,” you should also translate the verb here as “show <u>pity</u>.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the house of Israel:</strong> This phrase is a figure of speech that refers here to the nation of Israel, specifically the people of that nation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Israel (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the nation of Israel (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the people of Israel (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Try to translate the phrase <em>house of Israel</em> consistently, if the context is the same.

Her name indicates that the LORD will no longer forgive them. Both clauses have a similar, negative meaning.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Follingstad for a comprehensive discussion of the particle <em>ki</em>. McComiskey (page 24) says that the second clause further develops the thought of the first clause. According to Andersen and Freedman (page 192), the conjunction <em>ki</em> is “resumptive or assertive.” Their translation connects the two clauses with the word “or.” Dearman (page 92) agrees with Andersen and Freedman that the negative word “not” in the first clause modifies the second clause as well. Dearman connects the two negative statements with the word “and.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to express the relationship between these clauses:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a conjunction such as “and” or “or.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will no longer show love to the people of Israel <u>or</u> forgive them (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will no longer have mercy <u>and</u> forgive Israel (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Start a new sentence or clause at this point. Leave the connection implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will no longer love the nation of Israel. I will no longer forgive them. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I shall never again show love to Israel, never again forgive them. (REB)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>ever forgive them:</strong> In Hebrew, an emphatic form of the verb <em>forgive</em> is used here. It corresponds to the emphasis expressed in the phrase “no longer” in 1:6c. Some versions, such as the GW and REB quoted above, use an emphatic word or phrase in both 1:6c and 1:6d. The NET is similar:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will no longer have pity on the nation of Israel. For I will certainly not forgive their guilt. (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Other English versions use one expression of emphasis to cover both phrases. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will no longer have mercy and forgive Israel. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Emphasize this phrase in a way that is natural in your language.</p>",

The meaning of the child’s name, “not loved/pitied,” reinforced the LORD’s promise that he would destroy the northern kingdom of Israel. He promised to show them no mercy. In contrast, the LORD promised to deliver the people of Judah from destruction.</p></div><h4>1:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Yet I will have compassion on the house of Judah,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">unlike the people/nation of Israel</span> I will show love/pity to the people/nation of Judah.</p></li><li><p>But as for the people/nation of Judah, I will love/pity them,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Yet I will have compassion on the house of Judah:</strong> In contrast to the nation/people of Israel, the LORD will continue to show his compassion to the nation of Judah. This implies that the nation of Judah will not be judged/punished by the LORD at that time.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Yet:</strong> The BSB uses the conjunction <em>Yet</em> to introduce the contrast between the LORD’s judgment of Israel in 1:6 and his compassion toward Judah here in 1:7. Some versions use “but” or “instead.” You should introduce this contrast in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>have compassion:</strong> This is the same verb that was used in 1:6c. You should translate it in the same way.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the house of Judah:</strong> This phrase is a figure of speech.

The horses and cavalry (the men who rode the horses or drove the chariots into battle) were the strongest units in an army. By mentioning these weapons, horses, and cavalry, the LORD compared his power to the strongest human army and implied that he is stronger.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some cultures, people may not be familiar with these weapons and the use of horses in war. If that is true in your culture, you may need to make the meaning more explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will not do it by war—with swords or bows and arrows or with horses and horsemen (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will personally free them from their enemies without any help from weapons or armies (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>1:7d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:7d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but by the LORD their God.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Rather it will be Yahweh their God who will rescue them.”</p></li><li><p>No, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I myself,</span> Yahweh their God, will rescue them <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with my own power</span>.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but by the LORD their God:</strong> The LORD indicated that he will not be using a human army as his instrument to save Judah.

Use a natural way in your language to introduce this reason.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you are not My people:</strong> This is the reason that the LORD told Hosea to name his son Lo-ammi. The name will indicate to the people of Israel that the LORD will no longer regard them as his people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The pronoun <em>you</em> here is plural. Although God was speaking to Hosea, the plural pronoun indicates that these words referred to the people of Israel. If it is confusing to use a plural <em>you</em> pronoun, you may need to change the wording to make it clear that this clause refers to a group of people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because <u>the people of Israel</u> are not my people (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because <u>you, the people of Israel</u>, are not my people</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and I am not your God:</strong> In Hebrew, this clause is literally “and I, I will not be to you<sup>(plur)</sup>.” The word <em>God</em> is not in the Hebrew, but it is clearly implied. It is recommended that you make it explicit, as in most English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you translated the previous phrase “you are not my people” similarly to the GNT, it is suggested that you follow a similar approach here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and I am not <u>their</u> God (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, a phrase such as <em>your God</em> may imply “God belongs to you.” If that is true in your language, you may need to express the meaning of this phrase in a different way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I am no longer the God whom you worship/serve.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you have a section heading between this verse and 1:10, you will need to decide whether to use a closed quote mark at the end of the LORD’s words.

It has different verse and chapter numbers from the majority of English translations. These Notes follow the system of most English versions (unlike the NJPS and the NJB, which follow the Hebrew numbering system). You need to decide which system you are going to follow and be consistent throughout your translation. Usually it is good to follow the same chapter and verse numbering that is used by most other translations in your area.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In the previous section, 1:2–9, the LORD said that he no longer considered the people of Israel to be his people. In this section, 1:10–2:1, the LORD continued to speak to the people of Israel. He told them that there was still hope. He would make them a great and mighty nation in the future.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The BSB does not start a new section here, but TN and some other versions do.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s Promise to Israel (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Hope for Israel (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Restoration of Israel (NRSV)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1028001010\" data-endVerseId=\"1028002001\"><h3>Paragraph 1:10–2:1</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">The message of future hope for Israel in this paragraph contrasts with the messages of judgment that precede it. The Israelites had been unfaithful to the LORD. They had broken the covenant he made with them through Moses at Mt. Sinai. In spite of that, the LORD reminded them here that he still intended to keep the promise of the earlier covenant that he had made with their ancestor Abraham. In the future, he will once again bless the nation of Israel. He will increase their numbers and reunite the northern kingdom of Israel with the southern kingdom of Judah.</p></div><h4>1:10</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">If you start a new section here, you may need to make explicit at the beginning of 1:10 that the LORD is still speaking. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The Lord continued to speak. He said</span> …</p></blockquote><h4>1:10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Yet the number of the Israelites will be like the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or counted.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Then Yahweh said,</span> “But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the future</span> the people of Israel will become <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as many</span> as the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">grains of</span> sand on the seashore that no one can count or measure.</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yahweh continued to speak, saying,</span> “But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the future</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I will cause</span> the Israelites to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">become many again</span>. Their number will be like the sand on the edge of the ocean that is impossible to count.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Yet:</strong> This verse contrasts strongly with the previous verses. You should translate it in a way that indicates this contrast. If this is a new section in your translation, you may have to make the link to the previous section explicit by repeating part of verse 9. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Although I have said that you are no longer my people,</span> yet….</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Israelites:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase is literally “the number of the sons of Israel.” It refers here to the entire nation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the number of the people of Israel (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will be like the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or counted:</strong> This is a figure of speech (simile) that the LORD first used in Genesis 22:17 and Genesis 32:12. Those verses expressed his covenant promise to Abraham. Here the simile compares the number of Israelites to the sand on the seashore. The point of similarity is that they will be <u>so many</u> that no one will be able to count them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Hebrew and most English versions state the word “number” explicitly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Israelites will become as <u>numerous as</u> the grains of sand on the seashore. No one will be able to measure them or count them. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the <u>number of the</u> people of Israel will be like the sand of the sea which can be neither measured nor numbered. (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate in a natural way that makes the correct meaning of the simile clear.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>cannot be measured or counted:</strong> The words <em>measured</em> and <em>counted</em> have almost the same meaning in this context. They are used together for the sake of emphasis. The word <em>measured</em> does not occur in either of the similar verses in Genesis. In this context, it refers to measuring the amount of something dry like sand, using a container whose size is known.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If your language has a word for measuring something like sand, you may use it here. If it is confusing to compare the number of people to sand that is measured, you may want to use only one expression, as some English versions have done. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Someday it will be impossible to count the people of Israel, because there will be as many of them as there are grains of sand along the seashore. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You should translate this figure of speech in a way that is consistent with Genesis 22:17 and 32:12, so that readers can recognize that these words refer back to the LORD’s covenant with Abraham. At the same time, notice that there are some minor differences between these verses. If possible, you should maintain these differences in your translation. It is suggested that you refer to these Genesis verses in a footnote or in some other way.</p><h4>1:10b–c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:10b–c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And it will happen that in the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not My people,’ they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>In the place where they were told, ‘You<sup>(plur)</sup> are no longer my people,’ they will be told, ‘You are children of the living God.’</p></li><li><p>In the location where Yahweh said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ he will say to them, ‘You are the children of the God who is alive.’</p></li><li><p>In the place where Yahweh said to them that they were not his people, he will say to them that they are the children of the God who has life.</p></li></ul></div><h4>1:10b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the very place where it was said to them:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>in the very place where</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to a literal geographical <u>place</u>, either the land of Israel or the land where the people will be exiled.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Andersen and Freedman, Stuart, Keil, Davies, McComiskey, Dearman, and Wood all understand this to refer to a place. Keil (page 32) supports the land of exile, citing v. 11 where the people come out of exile. The Targums, Rashi and Ibn Ezra also understand the land of exile, but Davies (pages 60–61) feels that the land of Israel is more likely, following the people’s return from exile. Wood (page 173) says that the particular place is not important.</span></span> In this same place, the words that the LORD will say to the people will contrast with his previous words. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>at the <u>place</u> where they were told (NLT) <em>(BSB, ESV, GW, KJV, NASB, NIV, NLT, NJB, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is a special use of the Hebrew phrase. Here it means “<u>in place of</u>” or “<u>instead of</u>.” It does not refer here to a literal place. It simply introduces the contrasting words that the LORD will say to the people with his previous words. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>instead of</u> being told (NJPS) <em>(CEV, GNT, NCV, NET, NJPS, REB)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The CEV, NCV, REB, and GNT do not use an explicit word or phrase such as “instead.” They simply give the contrasting statements. The NET has “Although…,” indicating a concessive relationship. The NJPS is the only version that uses the word “instead.”</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with almost all commentaries and lexicons. The Hebrew word for <em>place</em> normally refers to a location. It occurs with this meaning approximately five hundred times in the Old Testament.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT (#5582) says there are approximately 500 occurrences of <em>maqom</em>. All the senses given in HALOT refer to locations. TWOT (#1999h) says that this “noun represents the physical location where something is or ought to be.” NIDOTTE (#5226) is similar. Its glosses all indicate locations. BDB (#8491, page 880) lists Hosea 1:10 (2:1) under sense 4, “place, locality, spot.” It also lists this verse under sense 7, “peculiar uses,” where it has “perhaps b.…instead of.” The two other verses listed under 7b (Isaiah 33:21 and Nahum 1:8) are not translated as “instead of” by any English version on TW or Bible Gateway.</span></span> With this interpretation, the focus in this verse is still on the changed relationship between God and his people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>it was said to them:</strong> This is a passive clause. The implied speaker is the LORD.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If it is more natural in your language to use an active verb in this context, here is another way to translate it:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the LORD said to them</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You are not My people:</strong> This is the same phrase as in 1:9b. Translate it the same way here.</p><h4>1:10c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they will be called:</strong> This is a passive clause like the similar clause in 1:10b. See the General Comment on 1:10b–c for a way to translate this as an active clause.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>sons of the living God:</strong> The Hebrew expression <em>sons of</em> can refer either to sons or to both sons and daughters. In this context, it refers to the entire nation, so a translation such as “children” is preferable to <em>sons</em>.

For example:<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The expression may be an allusion to the exodus from Egypt, which the people of Hosea’s time may have recognized. In Exodus 1:10, Pharaoh of Egypt warned that the Hebrews might “go up from the land,” that is, escape from Egypt.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and will spread far beyond their country (NJB) <em>(NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The people <u>will prosper in their own land</u>. This meaning is figurative. It fits with the metaphor of planting that is used in 2:23. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they will grow and prosper in their land (GNT) <em>(GNT, GW, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with a majority of versions.

In contrast to the negative connotations of Jezreel in 1:4–5, it explains that the LORD intends to give the name Jezreel the good connotations of planting. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for great will be the day of Jezreel (REB) <em>(BSB, ESV, KJV, NASB, NCV,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NCV has “because the day of Jezreel will be truly great. It has been listed under interpretation (1), because it translates the initial Hebrew word <em>ki</em> as “because.” The whole clause, which includes “truly great,” is also emphatic, but it differs from interpretation (2) in which the deictic particle <em>ki</em> introduces the clause as a whole.</span></span> NIV, NJB, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It <u>introduces an emphatic statement</u>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Commentaries that support interpretation (2) include: Andersen and Freedman, Stuart, and Lange. Andersen and Freedman (pages 209–210) point out that this clause doesn’t seem to be a logical reason. They argue that <em>ki</em> serves rather to intensify the word “great.” Stuart (pages 35–36) admits that the <em>ki</em> clause is grammatically ambiguous, but he agrees that an explanation does not seem to fit here. He translates the clause as an exclamation: “How great the day of Jezreel will be!”</span></span> In contrast to the negative connotations of Jezreel in 1:4–5, it emphasizes the LORD’s wonderful plans for Jezreel in the future. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Certainly, the day of Jezreel will be great! (NET) <em>(GNT, NET, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Most versions and commentaries follow this interpretation.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Commentaries that support interpretation (1) include: Keil, McComiskey, Dearman, and Barnes. McComiskey (page 30) gives the fullest explanation that the Hebrew particle introduces a reason here. He says that “Jezreel…prefigures a time of sowing (or great repopulation) for the nation…. Thus Hosea gives new significance to the name of the valley that witnessed the demise of the northern kingdom…” Other commentaries (including Wood and Macintosh) do not mention the particle <em>ki</em> specifically, but their understanding of the new future significance of the name Jezreel is very similar to that of McComiskey. See also TWOT (#976), which mentions that the assertive use of <em>ki</em> is relatively rare compared to the other uses.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, some scholars think that 1:11d is not a logical reason or explanation for 1:11a–c. If that is true in your language, you may want to follow interpretation (2). With either interpretation, it is recommended that you give the other interpretation in a footnote.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>great:</strong> Some other ways to translate the word <em>great</em> are “important” or “wonderful.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the day of Jezreel:</strong> The word <em>Jezreel</em> referred to the name of a valley in Israel. It was also the name of Hosea’s son (see 1:4a). It literally means “God scatters.” In 1:4–5, it had the bad connotation that God would scatter Israel among the nations. Here it means “scatters/sows (seed).” The expression <em>day of Jezreel</em> probably refers to a time in the future when the LORD will figuratively “plant” the people of Israel in their own country after their exile.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this expression:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use the literal expression <em>day of Jezreel</em> in your translation.</p></li><li><p>Use the literal expression <em>day of Jezreel</em> in your translation along with the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the day of Jezreel, the day when God will again plant his people in his land<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Adapted from the NLT.</span></span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the name <em>Jezreel</em> in your translation, but adjust the expression <em>day of</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the day called Jezreel</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Whichever way you translate the expression <em>day of Jezreel</em>, it is recommended that you add a footnote to explain the meaning. Here is a possible footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Jezreel means “God scatters.” In 1:4–5 it implied that God would punish his people by scattering them far from their own country. Here it implies that God will scatter his people like a sower scatters seed and will cause them to grow once again in their own country.</p></blockquote>",

In those verses, the LORD told Hosea to name his children “Not Loved” and “Not My People” (see notes on 1:9b). In this verse, he uses the same words as in 1:6 and 1:9 to promise a renewal of his covenant with them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Say <u>of your brothers</u>, ‘<strong>My people</strong>,’</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and <u>of your sisters</u>, ‘<strong>My loved one</strong>.’</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">These two parallel statements are a poetic way to emphasize that the LORD is restoring his covenant relationship with all the people.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>brothers…sisters:</strong> Both of these terms refer to the same people, that is, Israelites. They do not refer to literal <em>brothers</em> and <em>sisters</em>. In languages that do not use gender-specific terms for <em>brothers</em> and <em>sisters</em>, you may need to use phrases such as “male siblings” and “female siblings.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>‘My people’…‘My loved one’:</strong> In Hebrew, the name of Hosea’s daughter was Lo-ruhamah “Not Loved” and the name of his son was Lo-ammi “Not My People.” (See 1:6 and 1:9) The word <em>lo</em> in Hebrew means “not.” In this verse, the Hebrew words are literally <em>ruhamah</em> and <em>ammi</em>. These are the exact same words as in 1:6 and 1:9, except that they are not preceded by the word “not.” If it is possible in your language, you should translate these expressions in a way that makes this connection to 1:6 and 1:9 clear.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">To do that, use the same method to express <em>My people</em> and <em>My loved one</em> in your translation as you used to express the meaning of Lo-Ruhamah in 1:6b and Lo-ammi in 1:9a. For example, if you used the Hebrew name, <em>lo-ruhamah</em> in your translation of 1:6 and gave the meaning in a footnote, then use the Hebrew word <em>ruhamah</em> here and give the meaning <em>loved</em> in a footnote. Or, if you translated the name Lo-ruhamah as “Not Loved” in your translation of 1:6, then here you should translate “Loved.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is also important that in your translation the pronoun referent of “my” will be understood as the LORD and not as the Israelite who is speaking to his brother or sister. In other words, <em>My people</em> means “the LORD’s people” and <em>My loved one</em> means “the LORD’s loved one.” In some languages, it may be clearer to make the pronoun referent explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>“the LORD’s People” and “Loved-by-the-Lord.”</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:1</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to combine the parallel ideas into one line.

He commanded them to rebuke their mother (2:2a). However, the words “declares the LORD” in 2:13c indicate that the LORD is the speaker throughout this section. The reason for this double reference is that this section has both literal and figurative meanings. Literally, it applies to the relationship between Hosea, his wife Gomer, and their children. Figuratively, it expresses the relationship between the LORD and Israel. In a complex metaphor, the nation of Israel is compared to the LORD’s wife. At the same time, the entire nation of Israel is compared to a mother, and the individual Israelites that made up the nation are compared to her children.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Andersen and Freedman (pages 219–220) and Wood (page 175).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The LORD’s future punishment of Israel</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Israel is the Lord’s unfaithful wife (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Unfaithful Gomer—Unfaithful Israel (GNT)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1028002002\" data-endVerseId=\"1028002005\"><h3>Paragraph 2:2–5</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">This paragraph contains the first examples in Hosea of Hebrew poetry, including the use of parallel lines.

There are two ways to interpret the word here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>to accuse</u>. The children were told to accuse their mother of adultery.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This expression would be appropriate for an accusation in a trial for adultery (Stuart, page 47). According to ancient documents, an adulterous wife was sometimes punished by stripping her naked and turning her away. The children typically performed this legal act. It was intended to humiliate a wife who had abandoned her husband to live with another man (IVP Bible Background Commentary).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Accuse</u>! <u>Accuse</u> your mother! (CEV) <em>(BSB, CEV, NAB, NASB, NIV, NJB, NLT, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>to plead</u>. The children were told to plead with their mother to stop her adultery. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Plead</u> with your mother, <u>plead (NRSV)</u> <em>(ESV, GNT, GW, KJV, NET, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most lexicons and commentaries. The Hebrew verb used in this verse is not used elsewhere in the Old Testament to describe an appeal that someone change his ways.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions use an expression that refers to an actual trial. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>take your mother to court (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">But this verse may also refer to an informal accusation or rebuke, so if possible, use a more general expression, as in the NIV or CEV.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Rebuke…rebuke:</strong> In Hebrew and in some English versions, the word is repeated to emphasize the seriousness of this command. Another way to give emphasis is to add a word that intensifies the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>Sternly</u> accuse your mother</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a natural way in your language to emphasize this command.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your mother:</strong> This phrase refers literally to Gomer, the mother of Hosea’s children. At the same time, Gomer represented the entire nation of Israel. Her children represented the individual Israelites whom the LORD commanded to rebuke the nation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If possible, translate this phrase in a general way that allows both meanings to be understood. If the figurative meaning is not clear from the context, you may want to explain it in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In this verse, Hosea told his children to accuse their mother Gomer of committing adultery. This was a symbol of the LORD telling individual Israelites to accuse their mother, the nation of Israel, of committing spiritual adultery by worshiping idols.</p></blockquote><h4>2:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for she is not My wife,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because now she does not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">consider herself to be</span> my wife,</p></li><li><p>She no longer acts like she is my wife.</p></li></ul></div><h4>2:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and I am not her husband.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">and/so now</span> I do not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">consider myself to be</span> her husband.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">As a result,</span> I no longer act like I am her husband.</p></li></ul></div><h4>2:2b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2b</sup>for <u>she</u> is <strong>not My wife</strong>,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2c</sup>and <u>I</u> am <strong>not her husband</strong>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for:</strong> This word introduces the reason that the children are told to rebuke their mother.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>2b</sup>She no longer acts like my wife. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>2c</sup>And I no longer act like I am her husband.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Be careful not to imply that the husband had been unfaithful to his wife and had broken their relationship.</p><h4>2:2d–e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2d–e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(combined/reordered)</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Tell/Command<sup>(plur)</sup> her to stop her prostitution and adultery.</p></li><li><p>She must stop sleeping with men who are not her husband.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2d</sup>Let her remove <u>the adultery</u> <strong>from her face</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2e</sup>and <u>the unfaithfulness</u> <strong>from between her breasts</strong>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the adultery…the unfaithfulness:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>adultery</em> is literally “her immoralities.” The word “immoralities” means sexual activity that is contrary to God’s law. It is the same word that was used in 1:2b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>unfaithfulness</em> is literally “her adulteries.” The word “adulteries” refers to sexual intercourse with someone other than her husband.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Both these plural terms describe the woman’s character. They indicate repeated or habitual behavior, as in the NCV and NET quoted below.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Biblical Hebrew Reference Grammar for Students, NET footnote.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>from her face…from between her breasts:</strong> In Hebrew, it is common to refer to behavior by mentioning the parts of the body (face, breasts) that are associated with this behavior. These figurative expressions refer to the shameless attitude and behavior of a woman who is openly immoral and unfaithful to her husband.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to Macintosh (page 39), biblical Hebrew commonly refers to particular parts of the body to describe both attitudes and actions. He mentions Jeremiah 3:3 and Ezekiel 23, both of which describe prostitutes in language that is similar to Hosea 2:2. Keil, Wood, and Lange also favor the view that these figurative expressions refer primarily to the woman’s behavior. Stuart, Andersen and Freedman, and Davies suggest that the expressions may (also) refer to the makeup and/or jewelry that a prostitute wore. The NLT translates the first expression as “makeup.” No other versions use terms such as makeup or jewelry.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate these expressions:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to stop acting like a prostitute, to stop behaving like an unfaithful wife.

Hosea is instructing his children to tell their mother to stop being unfaithful to him.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">If it is not natural to use a third-person command in your language, here are some other ways to translate this command:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Tell her to stop… (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I want her to stop…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>She must stop…</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:2d–e</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">These two statements emphasize one main point.

Use a natural way in your language to introduce an explanation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>their mother:</strong> See the note on “on her children” in 2:4a. Here there is a similar change of pronoun from “your” to <em>their</em>. As in 2:4a, the husband (symbolizing the LORD) is still speaking to the children.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>your</u> mother</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>has played the whore:</strong> The Hebrew expression that the NRSV translates as <em>has played the whore</em> is literally “she has committed fornication.” The word “fornication” can refer to adultery or prostitution. The latter part of the verse indicates that she received pay for her acts of adultery. So prostitution is the meaning in this context.

Use a natural way in your language to introduce an explanation.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>she thought, ‘I will go after my lovers:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>thought</em> is literally “said” In this statement, the husband used a direct quote to tell his children what their mother had said, thought or decided.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to Keil (page 37), the verb “said” may indicate either speaking or thinking. Both McComiskey (page 34) and Andersen and Freedman (page 230) say that this quote represents a decision on the part of the wife. It is not clear whether she spoke these words to her husband or merely made a decision, using these words, in her mind.</span></span> In some languages, it may be more natural to use indirect speech for the statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>she said/decided that she would go after her lovers…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I will go after my lovers:</strong> This clause means that the woman will go and look for men who will pay her to have sex with them. It emphasizes her deliberate intention to be unfaithful to her husband. Symbolically, it refers to Israel’s deliberate worship of the gods of other nations, such as Baal, rather than her own God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I shall chase after my lovers (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will seek out my lovers (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will search for men who are willing to have sex with me</p></blockquote><h4>2:5d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:5d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who give me bread and water, wool and linen, oil and drink.’</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They supply me with what I eat and drink.

It does not refer to gifts. In some languages, it may be necessary to make this clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I’ll…sell myself to them for food and water… (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they pay me with food and water…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>bread and water:</strong> This expression refers to the basic requirements of life.

Some versions translate this as “flax” (NRSV). These were the basic materials that the Israelites used to make their clothing. Some versions make this purpose explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for clothing of wool and linen (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If your language does not have specific terms for <em>wool</em> and <em>linen</em>, you may use a more general word or phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>my clothing</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the clothes that I wear</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>oil:</strong> The word <em>oil</em> is a general term that refers to oil from plants or from animal fat.

The reason for this double reference is that this section has both literal and figurative meanings. Literally, it applies to the relationship between Hosea, his wife Gomer, and their children. Figuratively, it expresses the relationship between the LORD and Israel. In a complex metaphor, the nation of Israel is compared to the LORD’s wife. At the same time, the entire nation of Israel is compared to a mother, and the individual Israelites that made up the nation are compared to her children.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Andersen and Freedman (pages 219–220) and Wood (page 175).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The LORD’s future punishment of Israel</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Israel is the Lord’s unfaithful wife (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Unfaithful Gomer—Unfaithful Israel (GNT)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1028002006\" data-endVerseId=\"1028002007\"><h3>Paragraph 2:6–7</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, the husband (symbolizing the LORD) continued talking to his children about the unfaithfulness of their mother (symbolizing the nation of Israel).

In Hebrew, a conjunction is used at the start of this verse to introduce the woman’s action. Some versions, such as the BSB, do not translate this conjunction explicitly. Other versions use an explicit conjunction. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>then</u> if she chases her lovers she will not catch them (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a natural word or phrase in your language to introduce the next thing that will happen.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>but not catch them:</strong> This phrase describes an intended result that will not happen.

It refers to the woman’s persistent efforts to go and have sex with other men. In some languages, a literal translation may wrongly imply that the lovers are trying to run away or that the woman cannot run fast enough to catch them. Use an expression in your language that gives the right meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Then, although she keeps trying to go and have sex with other men, she will not succeed.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If it is inappropriate to refer directly to having sex, use an acceptable euphemism in your language.

It describes the woman’s persistent searching for her lovers. In some languages, a literal translation may wrongly imply that the lovers are lost and that the woman is trying to find them. The correct meaning is that she tries hard to find opportunities to have sex with them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>she will look carefully/diligently for opportunities to go and meet with her lovers.</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:7a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to combine and/or reorder these two verse parts.

At the same time, the entire nation of Israel is compared to a mother, and the individual Israelites that made up the nation are compared to her children.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Andersen and Freedman (pages 219–220) and Wood (page 175).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The LORD’s future punishment of Israel</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Israel is the Lord’s unfaithful wife (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Unfaithful Gomer—Unfaithful Israel (GNT)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1028002008\" data-endVerseId=\"1028002013\"><h3>Paragraph 2:8–13</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, Hosea continues to use the image of an adulterous wife to represent the unfaithful nation of Israel.

BDB does not cite Hosea 2:8.</span></span> So there are two ways to interpret this phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“She does not acknowledge.” She (Israel) knew the truth, but she refused to admit that her husband (the LORD) was the one who supplied her needs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>she would never acknowledge (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>she has refused to acknowledge (NET) <em>(BSB, GNT, NET, NIV, NJPS)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>“She did not know.” She (Israel) was not aware that her husband (the LORD) provided her food. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>she did not know (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>she had never realized before (NJB) <em>(CEV, ESV, KJV, NAB, NASB, NCV, NJB, NLT, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most commentaries.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This interpretation is supported by Andersen and Freedman (page 242), McComiskey (page 36), Macintosh (page 54), Wood (page 176), Lange (page 37), and Pusey (page 32). Lange points out that the Israelites “must have been inwardly conscious” that God was the Giver” and “could have known it from the law, but they ignored this truth, denied it.”</span></span> Verse 2:7d implies that Israel did know that the LORD had been her provider in the past.</p><h4>2:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that it was I who gave her grain, new wine, and oil,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>that it was I who provided her with the grain, wine, and olive oil <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that she needed</span>.</p></li><li><p>that I was the one who made their crops grow and gave them wine and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">cooking</span> oil</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that it was I who gave her:</strong> In Hebrew, the pronoun <em>I</em> that is used here indicates emphasis. The BSB expresses this emphasis by using special wording.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other languages may be able to use an emphatic pronoun. Use a natural way in your language to express this emphasis.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>grain, new wine, and oil:</strong> These three items are often listed together in the Old Testament (for example, Deuteronomy 7:13). They were basic products of agriculture that the nation depended upon to sustain them. Together they represented everything that the LORD had provided for the Israelites.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>grain:</strong> This word refers to any kind of <em>grain</em>. In languages that do not have a general word for <em>grain</em>, here are two other options:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use the word for a specific grain crop, such as wheat or rice.</p></li><li><p>Use a more general term, such as “crop” or “what is harvested.”</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>new wine:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>new wine</em> refers to wine that has been pressed recently from grapes. It is not yet fermented or is just beginning to ferment.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>fresh wine</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions do not specify <em>new</em> wine, probably because the emphasis is on the LORD’s provision of the wine, not on its age. If it is awkward to express the concept of newly made wine, you may want to use a more general term. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wine (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>wine:</strong> <em>wine</em> is an alcoholic drink. It is made from the juice of a fruit called grapes. When grape juice ferments, it becomes wine.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some areas, people may not be familiar with grapes or with wine.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If that is true in your area, here are some other ways to translate <em>wine</em>:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a specific term for another alcoholic drink made from fruit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>pomegranate wine</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a drink like palm wine</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a descriptive phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>fruit juice/water</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>grape juice</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>oil:</strong> See the note in 2:5d.</p><h4>2:8c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:8c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who lavished on her silver and gold—which they crafted for Baal.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I also gave her/Israel much silver and gold, but she used these things for Baal!</p></li><li><p>and also much silver and gold. But they used <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that silver and gold</span> to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">worship the false god</span> Baal.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who lavished on her:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>lavished</em> is literally “multiplied.” It indicates that the LORD gave it generously.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>giving her more and more (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I gave her much (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>silver and gold—which they crafted for Baal:</strong> These two phrases describe the unexpected way in which the people used the silver and gold that the LORD gave them. The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>crafted</em> is a somewhat general verb for action taken on an item. It could mean “to do,” “to use,” or “to make.” It does not indicate specifically how the people used <em>silver and gold</em> for Baal. They may have used it to make idols of Baal, but they may also have used it in other ways that were related to Baal worship. For that reason, you should use a general phrase to translate this statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>which they used for Baal (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>which they have spent on Baal (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>which they used in worshiping Baal (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions use punctuation marks to emphasize the fact that the Israelite’s behavior was unexpected. It was the LORD who gave them these gifts, but instead they used the gifts to honor a false god. For example, the NET uses a hyphen and exclamation mark for emphasis:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>silver and gold—which they used in worshiping Baal! (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The NCV creates similar emphasis by using the word “but”:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I gave her much silver and gold, but she used it for Baal. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a natural way in your language to emphasize that this behavior was unexpected.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>they:</strong> The preceding pronouns “she/her” in 2:8a–c refer to the nation or people of Israel. The following pronouns in 2:9b–10a are the same. Here in 2:8c, the pronoun <em>they</em> is used. You should use a phrase or pronoun in your language that clearly refers to the nation or people of Israel.</p>",

He commanded them to rebuke their mother (2:2a). However, the words “declares the LORD” in 2:13c indicate that the LORD is the speaker throughout this section. The reason for this double reference is that this section has both literal and figurative meanings. Literally, it applies to the relationship between Hosea, his wife Gomer, and their children. Figuratively, it expresses the relationship between the LORD and Israel. In a complex metaphor, the nation of Israel is compared to the LORD’s wife.

Similarly, Hosea will punish Gomer, because she was unfaithful to him.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The notes and translation advice in this paragraph focus mainly on the way that the LORD intends to punish Israel.

Either way is acceptable:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As <u>specific</u> festival days for Baal. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the festival days of the Baals, when she offered incense to them. (NRSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As <u>unspecific</u> times, whenever people worshiped Baal. These times included the feast days for Baal, but may have included other times also. The BSB above is one example. Another example is the GNT:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the times that she forgot me, when she burned incense to Baal. (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Baals:</strong> Baal was the name of the main Canaanite god. The Hebrew word here is plural.

So English versions translate this term in two ways. Either way is acceptable:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As <u>plural</u> <em>Baals</em>. This is how the BSB and most English versions have translated it.</p></li><li><p>As <u>singular</u> “Baal.” This is how the GNT has translated it.</p></li></ul><h4>2:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>when she decked herself with rings and jewelry, and went after her lovers.

In this context, there is a contrast between Israel pursuing lovers but forgetting the LORD. So “but” is an appropriate translation. Some versions leave this conjunction implied. Use a natural way in your language to express this contrast.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In Hebrew, the word order of the pronoun <em>Me</em> within this clause gives it strong emphasis. The BSB shows this emphasis by using the word order <em>Me she forgot</em> instead of the more common English word order “she forgot me.” Another way that English versions show this emphasis is by using an exclamation mark. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but she forgot me!

In this section, 2:14–23, the LORD showed that he continued to love the people of Israel. If they worshiped him, he would bless them and not harm them. In spite of their past sins, he would reestablish a covenant with them. In this section, the tone switches from negative to positive, so there is a sharp contrast between the previous section and this one.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples of section headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Future Repentance and Restoration of Israel (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lord’s Love for Unfaithful Israel (NLT)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1028002014\" data-endVerseId=\"1028002015\"><h3>Paragraph 2:14–15</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, the LORD described his intention to reestablish a covenant relationship with Israel. He used the image of a man courting a woman in the desert to illustrate it. This image referred to Israel’s past. After the Israelites left Egypt, they wandered for forty years in the desert of Sinai. It was there that the LORD first established his covenant with the Israelites.</p></div><h4>2:15a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:15a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>There I will give back her vineyards</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>From there I will return her vineyards to her.</p></li><li><p>I will make her vineyards grow again.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>There I will give back her vineyards:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>There</em> is literally “From there,” as in the NRSV. In this context, it refers to the same image of Israel in the wilderness as 2:14b. It was from this desert that the LORD promised to restore to Israel her vineyards.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Andersen and Freedman (page 272), Stuart (page 53), and McComiskey (page 42). Andersen and Freedman comment that “there” and “from there” often differ only slightly in meaning.</span></span> This promise referred to the future restoration of vineyards in Israel. Some versions leave the word “there” or “from there” implied.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I will give back her vineyards:</strong> In 2:12, the LORD said that he would destroy Israel’s vineyards, but here in 2:15, he promised to restore them. Some versions indicate this idea of restoration explicitly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will <u>give back</u> to her the vineyards she had (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I shall <u>restore</u> her vineyards to her (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will <u>return</u> her vineyards to her (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Other versions leave it implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>From there I will give her her vineyards (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Be sure that the idea of restoration is clear in your translation.</p><h4>2:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and make the Valley of Achor into a gateway of hope.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And I will make the Valley of Trouble into a Gateway/Door of Hope.</p></li><li><p>And she will not have to experience trouble/danger any longer.

As a result, the LORD allowed the enemies of Israel to defeat them. This happened when they were entering the promised land of Canaan (Joshua 7:1–26).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Hosea probably uses <em>the Valley of Achor</em> as a figure of speech (synecdoche) that represents the whole land.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Macintosh (pages 74–75).</span></span> He means that the LORD will change Israel from a nation that experienced trouble to a nation where people have hope.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions translate the meaning rather than the actual place name. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Valley of Trouble (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Trouble Valley (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions include a footnote that gives the Joshua reference and a brief explanation as above. Consider whether any of these options will help your readers better understand the meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a gateway of hope:</strong> The change from a place of disaster to <em>a gateway of hope</em> illustrated that Israel’s disastrous relationship with the LORD could be changed. Here, <em>hope</em> means “expectation, optimistic outlook.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT (#10282).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>gateway of hope (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Opportunity for Hope (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that the NET uses capital letters to show that this phrase is parallel to “Valley of Trouble.” Consider whether capital letters will help your readers to understand the parallelism.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If it is necessary to specify an object of <em>hope</em>, you may use a phrase that refers to prosperity or a better life. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a place where people have hope for a good life</p></blockquote><h4>2:15c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:15c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>There she will respond</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And she will respond <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by loving me</span></p></li><li><p>And she will say ‘Yes’ to me there</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>There:</strong> This word refers to the same place as it does in 2:15a. Some versions leave it implied.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>she will respond:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>respond</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>respond</u>. When the nation of Israel was young, she responded to the LORD’s love by accepting his covenant and obeying him. In this verse, the LORD said that she will respond like this again. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>There she will respond (NJB) <em>(BSB, CEV, GNT, GW, NCV, NJB, NJPS, NLT, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>sing</u>. When the LORD rescued the nation of Israel from the Egyptians at the Red Sea, they sang a song of thanksgiving (Exodus 15). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>There she will sing (NET) <em>(KJV, NASB, NET, NIV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Wood (page 179), feels that “sing” is an appropriate meaning here, because the context calls for a joyful response. Keil (page 42), mentions Israel’s song of praise at the Red Sea as one of her responses, but says that the verb means “answer” rather than “sing.” Stuart (page 53), says that the verb indicates a range of positive responses, and Andersen and Freedman (page 276), argue that “respond” is more appropriate in the context of the husband speaking.</span></span> “Respond” is the usual meaning of this verb. It also allows for more kinds of responses than just singing.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural to use direct speech to express her response. For example, here is a slight adaptation of the CEV:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>she will say ‘Yes’ to me</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, a verb such as <em>respond</em> is used only in the context of answering a question. If that is true in your language, you may need to use a different expression. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>She will give herself to me there (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>As a result, she will accept my love for her</p></blockquote><h4>2:15d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:15d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>as she did in the days of her youth, as in the day she came up out of Egypt.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>just as she did when she was a young woman, when she came out of Egypt.”</p></li><li><p>as she did when she left Egypt <span data-bnType=\"implied\">long ago</span> when she was young.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallelism:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>as she did in the days</u> of <strong>her youth</strong>,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>as in the day</u> <strong>she came up out of Egypt</strong></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The first line describes a period of time in the past. The second line describes an event that happened during that time.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>days…day:</strong> These words refer here to periods of time, not to literal 24-hour days.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as in her youth,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as when she came up from Egypt. (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>youth:</strong> This word refers here to Israel as a young nation, when the LORD established his covenant with her at Mt. Sinai.

Verse 2:16b gives a positive command. Verse 2:16c gives a corresponding negative command.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>16b</sup> <u>you will call Me</u> <strong>‘my Husband’</strong>;<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HOTTP suggests that the verb translated here as “call” has a double meaning.

The Hebrew word <em>ʾiš</em>, which the BSB translates as <em>Husband</em>, connotes an affectionate relationship between a man and his wife. The Hebrew word <em>baʿal</em>, which the BSB translates as <em>Master</em>, has the meanings “owner/master” and “husband.” Women commonly used this word to refer to their husbands, but it had a more formal or legal connotation. It was also the name of the Canaanite god, “Baal.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NET footnote, NIDOTTE (#1251), and Davies (page 82).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the context of this metaphor, the LORD (Israel’s God) was pictured as Israel’s husband. People who spoke Hebrew would have understood two things from this verse:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The LORD wanted Israel to be loyal to him alone. He did not want her to refer to him by the name of the heathen god Baal or to confuse him in any way with the worship of Baal.</p></li><li><p>The LORD wanted to have an intimate relationship with Israel. He wanted Israel to think of him as her beloved husband (<em>ʾiš</em>), not just her master (<em>baʿal</em>).</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">In most languages, it will not be possible to reproduce this play on words so that both meanings can be understood. There are two options:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate <em>baʿal</em> as a proper name. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My Baal (NJB) <em>(GNT, KJV, NASB, NCV, NJB, NJPS, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate <em>baʿal</em> as a title. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My master (NET) <em>(BSB, GW, NET, NIV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">The first option fits better with the following context, especially 2:17a. The second option fits better with the preceding context, especially 2:14 and 2:15c. The Display will follow the first option, but you may choose either option. It is recommended that you add a footnote to explain the play on words.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is a possible footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>There were two words for “husband” in Hebrew: <em>ish</em> and <em>baal</em>. The word <em>baal</em> also meant “master.” The LORD wanted Israel to no longer use the word <em>baal</em>, because Baal was also the name of one of the Canaanite gods. Instead, they should use the word <em>ish</em>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you:</strong> Up through 2:15, the LORD used the pronoun “she” to refer to Israel. But in this verse, he used the pronoun <em>you</em> to address the nation of Israel directly.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is a textual variant here. The MT (Hebrew) has “you will call” and ancient versions (Greek, Syriac, Vulgate) all have, “she will call me.” Most English versions follow the reading of the MT (BSB, CEV, KJV, NASB, NIV, NLT, NRSV), but some follow the ancient versions and read the third person “she” (GNT, NAB, NCV).</span></span> In Hebrew poetry, it is common for an author to alternate pronouns in this way, even though the pronoun referent remains the same. It happens frequently in this chapter.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In the MT (Hebrew) from 2:2 to 2:15, the LORD spoke about the people of Israel using third person (“she”). In this verse, he uses second person singular (“you”). In 2:17, he uses third person (“her”). Then, in 2:19, it is back to second person (“you”), and in 2:23, it is third person (“her”) again.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">One way that versions reduce the potential confusion to readers is by reducing the number of times the pronouns alternate. For example, the NLT changes to “you” in this verse (2:16) and continues to use “you” until 2:20. The GNT does it differently. It continues to use “she” in this verse:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Then once again she will call me her husband—she will no longer call me her Baal. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It changes to “you” in 2:19. In some languages, it may be more natural to use “they” when referring to the Israelites.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">You should use the most natural and least confusing way in your language to translate the pronouns here and in 2:17–18. The Display will follow the BSB pronoun choice in the first meaning line and give another pronoun choice in the second meaning line.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:16b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to put the negative statement before the positive statement.

In this section, 2:14–23, the LORD showed that he continued to love the people of Israel. If they worshiped him, he would bless them and not harm them. In spite of their past sins, he would reestablish a covenant with them. In this section, the tone switches from negative to positive, so there is a sharp contrast between the previous section and this one.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples of section headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Future Repentance and Restoration of Israel (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lord’s Love for Unfaithful Israel (NLT)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1028002016\" data-endVerseId=\"1028002020\"><h3>Paragraph 2:16–20</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Verses 16–17 describe a future time when the LORD will cause the Israelites to stop worshiping the gods they call Baals. The LORD alone will be the one they worship and serve.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In return for their devotion, he promised to protect them and their crops from wild animals and from war (verses 18–20). Compare the similar promise to the Israelites in Leviticus 26:5–6.</p></div><h4>2:17</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>17a</sup>For I <u>will remove from her lips</u> <strong>the names of the Baals</strong>;</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>17b</sup> <u>no longer will</u> <strong>their names</strong> <u>be invoked</u>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse explains why Israel will no longer use the names of Baal to refer to her husband, the LORD. It is because the LORD will stop Israel from doing so.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The first line means that the LORD will cause Israel to stop saying the various names of Baal. The second line indicates the result of the LORD’s action. The result is that the nation of Israel will no longer use the names of Baal, especially in prayers or vows.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Andersen and Freedman (page 279).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some versions, such as the BSB, leave this reason-result relationship implied. Other versions make it explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For I will remove the names of the Baal idols from your lips, so that you will never again utter their names! (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Express this relationship in a natural way in your language.</p><h4>2:17a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:17a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For I will remove from her lips the names of the Baals;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I will keep her from saying the names of Baal</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">For</span> I will cause you<sup>(sing)</sup> to stop worshiping the Baal <span data-bnType=\"implied\">idols/gods</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For I will remove from her lips the names of the Baals:</strong> This is a figure of speech in which the phrase <em>her lips</em> (literally “her mouth,” as in the NRSV) represents the action (of speaking) performed by the mouth. The line as a whole means that the LORD will not allow the Israelites to speak the names of the Baals. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will never let her say the names of Baal again (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>her lips:</strong> The Hebrew uses the pronoun <em>her</em> and not “your,” even though the pronoun refers to the same person here as in the previous verse. See the note on the pronoun “you” in 2:16b–c for translation advice.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Baals:</strong> The word <em>Baals</em> is plural. See the note on 2:13a. You should translate it the same way in both verses.</p><h4>2:17a–b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:17a–b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(combined/reordered)</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I will never let her/you<sup>(sing)</sup> speak the name of Baal again.</p></li></ul></div><h4>2:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>no longer will their names be invoked.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that she never speaks their names again.</p></li><li><p>You<sup>(sing)</sup> will never mention their names or call out to them <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for help</span> again.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>no longer will their names be invoked:</strong> This is a passive clause.

Compare the similar promise to the Israelites in Leviticus 26:5–6.</p></div><h4>2:18a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:18a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>On that day I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and the birds of the air and the creatures that crawl on the ground.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>At that time I will make an agreement with the wild animals, the birds, and the reptiles for their sake.</p></li><li><p>I will cause all the animals to agree <span data-bnType=\"implied\">not to harm you</span><sup>(plur)</sup>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>On that day:</strong> This is the same phrase that was used in 2:16a, and it refers to the same future time. For that reason, some versions do not repeat it here but leave it implied. That is an acceptable option as long as it is clear that the time period is the same.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will make a covenant for them:</strong> The word <em>covenant</em> is an important theological word that is used many times in the book of Hosea. Usually it refers to an agreement between God and people. Here it refers to an agreement that the LORD made with the animals for the benefit of the Israelites. If your key term for covenant does not allow this use, you may need to use a different term. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will make an agreement (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I shall make a treaty (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will cause…to agree</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for them:</strong> In this context, the Hebrew word that most versions translate as <em>for</em> means “for the benefit of” or “on behalf of.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Hubbard (page 86), McComiskey (page 44), Macintosh (page 81), and Davies (page 83).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>on Israel’s behalf (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions leave the phrase <em>for them</em> implied. Most of these versions use other phrases to clarify the kind of benefits that Israel will enjoy. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will make a covenant with all the wild animals and birds, <u>so that they will not harm my people</u>. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>them:</strong> Here in 2:18a, the pronoun <em>them</em> refers to the Israelites. The GNT uses the phrase “my people.” The CEV continues to use “you.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with the beasts of the field and the birds of the air and the creatures that crawl on the ground:</strong> In this context, these three phrases represent all animals that could cause harm to people or crops.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Hubbard (page 85) and Stuart.</span></span> The same three phrases occur in Genesis 1:30, although the context is different. See how you translated the same phrases there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the beasts of the field:</strong> This phrase refers to untamed animals that are often dangerous to people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Andersen and Freedman (page 281).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the wild animals (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the birds of the air:</strong> This phrase refers to flying creatures. In English, the words <em>of the air</em> are redundant, because the word <em>birds</em> includes this idea. So some English versions leave the words <em>of the air</em> implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the birds (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the creatures that crawl on the ground:</strong> This phrase refers to small animals, including reptiles.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Ibid. Also, Hubbard (page 85) and Macintosh (page 82).</span></span> In English, the category “wild animals” can include small animals. That is perhaps why some English versions, as the GNT, leave this phrase implied.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In other languages, it may be necessary to use two categories to express the meaning of this phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>crawling things and slithering things</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use categories that are natural in your language for describing the same kinds of living creatures. You may need to use more or less than three categories.</p><h4>2:18b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:18b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And I will abolish bow and sword and weapons of war in the land,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I will bring an end to war, to every bow and sword and battle in the/their land,</p></li><li><p>I will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">also</span> destroy every weapon of war in your<sup>(plur)</sup> country,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And I will abolish bow and sword and weapons of war in the land:</strong> This clause expresses an additional promise from the LORD. It is not related to the covenant with the animals in 2:18a. In some languages, it may be necessary to clarify that this is a separate promise. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will <u>also</u> remove… (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>abolish:</strong> In Hebrew, this word is literally “break.” It means “to break” the weapons in order to end warfare.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>remove (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>destroy (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>bow and sword and weapons of war:</strong> The bow and the sword were the two main weapons of war during the time of Hosea. Here these weapons are used as a figure of speech (synecdoche) that represents all weapons of war. The phrase <em>weapons of war</em> then summarizes and extends the figure to mean “warfare” or “battle” (NIV, ESV, RSV)</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>weapons of war (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all weapons of war from the land, all swords and bows (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the bow, the sword, and war from the land (ESV)</p></blockquote><h4>2:18c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:18c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and will make them lie down in safety.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that when they go to sleep, they will not fear danger.</p></li><li><p>so that you<sup>(plur)</sup> will have safe and peaceful lives.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and:</strong> The Hebrew conjunction <em>waw</em> that the BSB translates as <em>and</em> can have many different functions. Most English versions translate it here as <em>and</em>. But in this context, it probably introduces the purpose or intended result of the LORD’s previous actions.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>McComiskey (page 44) and Macintosh (page 82).</span></span> The purpose/result is that the people of Israel can live in safety.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This conjunction probably refers back to two actions: making the covenant (2:18a) and abolishing war (2:18b). Use a natural way in your language to introduce the purpose or intended result of the LORD’s previous actions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The result will be that (T4T)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>them lie down in safety:</strong> This statement tells what happens after the LORD makes the covenant with the animals and abolishes war. To <em>lie down in safety</em> means to sleep without fear of danger. It is a figure of speech that represents a safe life, not only safe sleep. In some languages, it may be clearer to translate this meaning directly and not keep the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and will let my people live in peace and safety (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so people can live safely (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that they will have no cause to fear</p></blockquote>",

Compare the similar promise to the Israelites in Leviticus 26:5–6.</p></div><h4>2:19–20</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">These two verses are one unit. The word that the BSB translates as “betroth” is repeated three times. This term refers figuratively to the LORD’s restored relationship with the people of Israel. Although the people had been unfaithful to him, he will restore their relationship as if he will get married to them again.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In Hebrew, the three repetitions of “I will betroth you” in 2:19–20 emphasize the image of a new marriage.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Andersen and Freedman (page 283).</span></span> If this kind of repetition expresses the same emphasis in a natural way in your language, you may want to maintain it. You may also want to format these verses to show the poetic structure more clearly. For example, the following fairly literal Hebrew translation indents the parallel lines.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>19a</sup>I will <u>betroth</u> you to me</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>forever;</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>19b</sup>I will <u>betroth</u> you to me</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in righteousness and in justice,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in love and compassion.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>20a</sup>I will <u>betroth</u> you to me</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in faithfulness,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>20b</sup>and you will know the LORD.</p></blockquote><h4>2:19a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:19a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So I will betroth you to Me forever;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">People of</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Israel,</span> I promise to take you<sup>(plur/sing)</sup> as my wife forever.</p></li><li><p>I will be your husband and you will be my wife forever.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will betroth you to Me forever:</strong> The word that the BSB translates here as <em>betroth</em> refers to a legally binding commitment to begin a marriage relationship.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In Hebrew culture, a betrothed couple did not sleep together until after the wedding, but in other ways they were considered to be legally married.</span></span> In this context, it is a promise to be married forever.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will make you my wife forever. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will commit myself to you forever (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you:</strong> In Hebrew, verse 2:18a uses the pronoun “them.” Verse 2:19a uses the pronoun <em>you</em>, because the LORD is speaking directly to the Israelites. In Hebrew, this pronoun is singular, because it compares the nation of Israel as a group to the LORD’s unfaithful wife.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions add the vocative “Israel” to make clear who the LORD is speaking to. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Israel, I will make you my wife forever. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to Me:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase occurs following each of the three occurrences of “betroth.” This repetition emphasizes the personal relationship that the LORD will have with his people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Andersen and Freedman (page 282).</span></span> Use a natural way in your language to emphasize the personal nature of this relationship.</p><h4>2:19b–20a</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will betroth you in righteousness and justice, in loving devotion and compassion:</strong> The phrases <em>in righteousness and justice, in loving devotion and compassion</em> and “in faithfulness” refer to the qualities that the LORD promises to show to Israel.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some scholars say these are qualities the LORD promises to demonstrate in his relationship with Israel (Davies, pages 85–86; Hubbard, page 87; Macintosh, page 83). Others say these are qualities the LORD promises to give to Israel so that Israel as well as the LORD will demonstrate them in their relationship (Andersen and Freedman, page 283). Still other scholars feel that both aspects are in view or that some of the qualities (such as love and compassion), apply more to the LORD, whereas faithfulness refers primarily to Israel’s response. Stuart (page 59), Wood (page 179), and Keil (page 43).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>betroth you in…:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase normally refers to a bride price, a gift that the husband gives to the bride’s father or to his bride. In this context, it probably refers to the qualities that the LORD promises to show to his bride, Israel.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The CEV is one version that uses the term “bride price.” It has: “instead of a bride price I will give you justice, fairness,…”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate these lines:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will be true and faithful; I will show you constant love and mercy and make you mine forever.

I will be true to you as my promised bride (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>righteousness and justice:</strong> The words that the BSB translates as <em>righteousness</em> and <em>justice</em> have similar meanings in this context. They refer here to the LORD’s promise to meet all his legal obligations as a figurative husband and to treat Israel fairly and properly.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate these words:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will be good and fair (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The way I treat you will be right and just/proper</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>loving devotion and compassion:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates here as <em>loving devotion</em> refers to the loyal love and kindness that the LORD shows to the people with whom he has made a covenant.

Compare the similar promise to the Israelites in Leviticus 26:5–6.</p></div><h4>2:20a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:20a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And I will betroth you in faithfulness,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I also promise to be faithful to you<sup>(plur/sing)</sup>.</p></li><li><p>As your husband, I will also keep all my promises to you.</p></li></ul></div><h4>2:20b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:20b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and you will know the LORD.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Then</span> you<sup>(plur/sing)</sup> will truly know <span data-bnType=\"implied\">me, I who am</span> Yahweh.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Then</span> you will be devoted to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">me,</span> Yahweh.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And:</strong> In this context, the Hebrew conjunction <em>waw</em> that the BSB translates as <em>And</em> introduces a result. As a result of the marriage relationship that is based on the qualities in 2:19b and 2:20a, Israel will know the LORD.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to introduce this result:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Then you will know the Lord. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The result is that you will know the LORD.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Introduce this result in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you will know the LORD:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>know</em> has more than one meaning related to knowing, experiencing, and understanding. There are two main ways to interpret this word in this context:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means that <u>Israel knows the LORD</u> in an intimate, personal way.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The verb “to know” is frequently used in the Old Testament as a euphemism for sexual intimacy between a man and his wife. Here it refers to Israel intimately knowing and experiencing God and his ways. There is no sexual component.</span></span> In the context of a betrothal covenant, it implies that Israel understands and enjoys the LORD’s character, as described in 2:19b–20a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you will truly know who I am (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you will finally know me as the Lord (NLT) <em>(BSB, CEV, ESV, GW, KJV, NAB, NASB, NCV, NJB, NJPS, NLT, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means that <u>Israel acknowledges or agrees that he is the LORD</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you will acknowledge me as Lord (GNT) <em>(GNT, NET, NIV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions and commentaries. In a marriage, symbolic or otherwise, a wife (Israel) knows her husband (the LORD) in a personal way. She does not just recognize or admit who he is.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages have different words for knowing someone personally and knowing facts about someone. If that is true in your language, you should use the word that refers to a personal relationship. In some languages, it may be necessary to use a different phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you shall be devoted to the Lord (NJPS)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the LORD:</strong> Here the LORD speaks of himself using third person <em>the LORD</em> . If it is not natural in your language for a person to refer to himself in that way, you may use the pronoun “I” or “me,” as the CEV has done (quoted above).</p>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And in that day, says the Lord (RSV) <em>(CEV, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1) along with most versions and commentaries.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is the first time that the phrase <em>I will respond</em> occurs in 2:21–22. The text does not identify who the LORD will respond to. There are two main ways to interpret the function of this statement here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It indicates that the LORD will <u>respond to the heavens</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>On that day I will answer, says the Lord, I will answer the heavens (NRSV) <em>(BSB, ESV, KJV, NASB, NET, NIV, NJB, NJPS, NLT, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It indicates that the LORD will <u>respond to the prayers of the Israelites</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will answer the prayers of my people Israel (GNT) <em>(GNT, GW, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions and commentaries. Some versions indicate that this is a general request that introduces other requests. The BSB does this by inserting a long dash. Another way to indicate this is to reorder the phrases in this verse part and use a colon. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The LORD says, “At that time I will respond:</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may not be possible to use a statement such as <em>I will respond</em> without indicating who the LORD is responding to. If that is true in your language, you may need to use a different phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The LORD says, “At that time this is what I will do:</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>declares the LORD:</strong> This phrase emphasizes that the message was directly from the LORD. This is the same phrase as in 2:13c.

It means that the LORD will do something in response to the implied request from the heavens that he send clouds or rain. In some languages, it may be necessary to clarify this figure of speech by making some of the implied information explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will answer the sky <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as it pleads for clouds</span> (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the heavens:</strong> In this context, the phrase that the BSB and many versions translate as <em>the heavens</em> refers to the sky, that is, the atmosphere above the earth.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they will respond to the earth:</strong> This is a figurative statement. It means that the skies will respond to the implied request of the earth for rain. In some languages, it may be necessary to make some of the implied information explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">which will pour down water</span> on the earth in answer to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">its cries for rain</span>. (NLT96)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>they:</strong> The plural pronoun <em>they</em> refers back to “the heavens.” If you translated “heavens” with a form such as “sky/heaven,” then you will need to use a singular form here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will speak to the sky, <u>it</u> will speak to the earth (GW)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:21b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to reorder and/or combine the parts of this verse.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will establish my people in the land and make them prosper.

It will help your readers to understand the connection with the name “Jezreel” in the previous verse.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>her:</strong> The NRSV translates this pronoun as “him” since it refers to Jezreel, which is normally masculine in gender. However, in Hebrew, this pronoun is feminine, probably since Jezreel represents Israel, the LORD’s bride.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In many languages, there is no distinction between masculine and feminine pronouns. Translate this pronoun so that it refers clearly to the people of Israel. In some cases, it may be clearer to use a more specific phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>At that time I will plant a crop of Israelites and raise them for myself! (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>as My own:</strong> This phrase indicates that the LORD will once more accept the Israelites as his own people.</p><h4>2:23b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:23b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and I will have compassion on ‘No Compassion.’</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">once again</span> show my love to the one I called/named ‘Not Loved/Pitied.’</p></li><li><p>I will show Lo-Ruhamah that I love her.</p></li></ul></div><h4>2:23c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:23c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I will say to those called ‘Not My People,’ ‘You are My people,’</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And those whom I called ‘Not My People’ I will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">once again</span> say to them, ‘You<sup>(plur)</sup> are my people.’</p></li><li><p>And I will say to Lo-Ammi, ‘You are my people.’</p></li></ul></div><h4>2:23b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallelism:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>23b</sup> <u>and I will have compassion</u> on ‘<strong>No Compassion</strong>.’</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>23c</sup> <u>I will say</u> to those called ‘<strong>Not My People</strong>,’ ‘<u>You are My people</u>,’</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">These parallel lines refer back to the names of Hosea’s second and third children given in 1:6–9. Each of these names had a negative meaning. In 1:10 and 2:1, the LORD said that he would give those names a positive meaning. In this verse, he spoke about the fulfillment of that promise. The LORD’s covenant with Israel will be restored and the Israelites will once more be his people.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some versions, such as the NJB, keep the names Lo-Ruhamah and Lo-ammi here. Others, such as the GNT, replace these Hebrew names with their meanings “Not my loved one” and “Not my people.” The NET includes both the meanings and the Hebrew names:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will have pity on ‘No Pity’ (Lo-Ruhamah). (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will say to ‘Not My People’ (Lo-Ammi), ‘You are my people!’</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">See the discussion in 1:6b and 1:9a on how to translate these names and their meanings. Depending on how you translated the names there, you may be able to translate them the same way here. But notice that the BSB transliterated the Hebrew names in 1:6b and 1:9, but it used the meanings of the names here in 2:23. That is because the names in chapter 1 referred to the literal children of Hosea and Gomer. Here in chapter 2, they refer to the people of Israel.

His action was an illustration of the LORD’s unfailing love for the nation of Israel. Israel had been unfaithful to the LORD and had been worshiping other gods. In the same way, Gomer had been unfaithful to Hosea and had left him for other lovers. And just as Hosea was commanded to take Gomer back as his wife, so the LORD planned to restore Israel to himself.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>An Illustration of God’s Love for Idolatrous Israel (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Hosea Redeems His Wife (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Hosea’s Reconciliation With His Wife (NIV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>3:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Then the LORD said to me, “Go show love to your wife again,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Then Yahweh said to me, “Go again and show/demonstrate your<sup>(sing)</sup> love for your wife,</p></li><li><p>¶ Then Yahweh said to me, “Go and take back your wife.

The word <em>again</em> modifies the verb <em>Go</em> or the phrase <em>Go show</em>…. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lord said to me, “<u>Go again and show</u> your love…” (GNT) <em>(BSB, ESV, GNT, GW, KJV, NET, NIV, NJB, NLT, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p><u>said again</u>. The word <em>again</em> modifies the verb <em>said</em>. This interpretation may indicate that the LORD is continuing the series of speeches described in 1:2–9.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Andersen and Freedman (page 294).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lord <u>said to me again</u>, “Go, love… (NRSV) <em>(CEV, NCV, NJPS, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most English versions.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Interpretation (1) is also supported by the LXX, Vulgate, and Peshitta. Commentaries that support this interpretation include Macintosh (page 93), Wood (page 181), and Keil (page 66). Interpretation (2) is supported by Stuart, Hubbard (page 90), and Andersen and Freedman (page 294).</span></span> This command probably refers back to 1:2b, where the LORD told Hosea, “Go, take a prostitue as your wife…” Here the meaning is that Hosea should go and take back his wife so that he can once again show his love to her as her husband.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>show love:</strong> The Hebrew word translated as <em>love</em> has a broad range of meaning. In this context, it probably means for Hosea to use words and acts of love to reaffirm his marriage. It probably does not mean to “court,” that is, to try to persuade the woman to respond, as in 2:16.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Andersen and Freedman (page 295).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your wife:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>your wife</em> is literally “a woman.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Go again, love a woman (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Most scholars think that this phrase refers to Hosea’s wife, Gomer.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Versions that specify “your wife” include the BSB, GW, NET, NIV, and NLT. Most versions translate this phrase literally. These versions include the CEV, ESV, GNT, NASB, NCV, NJB, NJPS, NRSV, REB, and RSV. Most of these versions are ambiguous, but the ESV, NASB, and NJB indicate by means of a heading or a footnote that they understand the word “woman” to refer to Hosea’s wife, Gomer. Of the commentaries, Stuart thinks this phrase probably refers to a different woman. McComiskey (page 50), Macintosh (page 97), Hubbard (page 54), Wood (page 181), Andersen and Freedman (page 295), Dorsey (page 265), and Bush (page 336) think that it refers to Gomer. This has not been discussed in the Notes as an interpretation issue, because no versions clearly specify that the word “woman” clearly refers to a different woman.</span></span> The “woman” is further described as an adulteress. This accurately describes Gomer. It is unlikely that the LORD would command Hosea to commit adultery by marrying a different woman who was also an adulteress. A specific reference to Gomer also fits the symbolism of the LORD again showing his love to Israel, the nation that he first chose as his own.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some of the commentators that support the first view are McComiskey, Macintosh, Hubbard, and Bush.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, a literal translation of the Hebrew phrase may imply that God commanded Hosea to show his love to a different woman.

However, since there is no verb in the Hebrew, it is not clear what the similar action refers to. There are two ways to interpret this statement:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means that both of them <u>will refrain from sexual activity</u>. In 3:3b, Hosea told Gomer to refrain from sexual activity. Here Hosea said that he too will refrain from sexual activity with her. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you shall not have intercourse with a man, nor I with you (NRSV) <em>(CEV, NLT, NJPS, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means that both of them <u>will live in the same home</u>. In 3:3a Hosea told Gomer to “live with” him. One implication of that command is that she must continue to live with Hosea in his home. Here Hosea promised that he will also continue to live with her. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will live with you (NIV) <em>(NIV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions (GNT, GW, NET, NJB) use a phrase such as “wait for.” In the context of 3:3b, this probably implies that Hosea and Gomer will need to wait before having sexual relations with each other.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NIV2011 says: “I will behave the same way toward you.” The NCV is similar. It has: “I will act the same way toward you.” The BSB has a similar translation. These versions do not specify a particular behavior or action, but in light of the preceding commands, they may imply sexual activity. Other versions (ESV, NASB, RSV) translate the Hebrew phrase quite literally. They are more ambiguous.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions and commentaries. This interpretation better fits the two preceding commands in 3:3b. These commands refer clearly to refraining from sexual activity. The long period without sexual intimacy between Gomer and Hosea is probably symbolic of the long period in 3:4 without a close relationship between Israel and the LORD. It may also symbolize a time of purification.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:3a–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to reorder and/or combine the parts of this verse in order to make the overall meaning clearer. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now you are mine! You will have to remain faithful to me, though it will be a long time before we sleep together. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to express the direct quote in this verse as an indirect quote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I told her that for a long time she would have to wait for me without being a prostitute or committing adultery; and during this time I would wait for her. (GNT)</p></blockquote></div>",

Macintosh (pages 106–107) also comments on the close association of these two terms, but concludes that the Israelites used the ephod in the context of the idolatrous cult to consult Yahweh. Wood (page 138) and Pusey (page 43) both make a distinction between the ephod, used by the high priest to consult Yahweh, and the idols (teraphim) used to consult pagan deities.

This term can refer to sacrifices to the LORD or sacrifices to idols.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But the time will come…Then (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But later…At that time (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to combine and/or reorder these phrases into one phrase.

In Division 4:1–10:15, Israel’s spiritual unfaithfulness continues to be described figuratively as prostitution. But the relationship between Hosea and Gomer is not mentioned again. These chapters describe the LORD’s response to his people’s unfaithfulness. The LORD condemned Israel and announced his plans to punish them. He also expressed his disappointment at their refusal to repent.</p></div>",

In 4:1–3, the LORD brought an accusation or charge against the people of Israel. The charge consisted of three parts. First, the LORD stated their crimes (4:1). Second, he presented the evidence of their crimes (4:2). Third, he announced the resulting judgment (4:3). The charge serves as a general introduction to the messages that follow in the remainder of chapter 4.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples of section headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lord’s Legal Case Against Israel (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lord Accuses Israel (ESV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>4:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Hear the word of the LORD, O children of Israel,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ People of Israel, hear these words from Yahweh,</p></li><li><p>¶ You<sup>(plur)</sup> Israelites, listen to what Yahweh has to say!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Hear the word of the LORD:</strong> In the Old Testament, this command was a standard way to introduce a prophetic message or warning of judgment. It emphasized that the message that followed was important because it was from the LORD. Hosea told the message to the people, but the LORD was the source of the message.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this command:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>hear what Yahweh says (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>O children of Israel:</strong> See the note on “the Israelites” in 3:1c. The same phrase also occurs in 3:4a. Hosea used this phrase here to address the Israelites directly.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this vocative:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>O people of Israel (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a term of address (vocative) that is natural in your language when a person speaks to a group of people.</p><h4>4:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for the LORD has a case against the people of the land:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because he has a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">serious</span> accusation/charge to make against you<sup>(plur)</sup> who live in this land/country:</p></li><li><p>Yahweh/He has accused all of you who live <span data-bnType=\"implied\">here</span> in the land <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Israel</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for the LORD has a case against the people of the land:</strong> In Hebrew, the word <em>for</em> probably introduces the reason or motivation for the Israelites to listen carefully to the LORD’s message.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to McComiskey (page 56), Macintosh (page 56), and Wood (page 184), the Hebrew word <em>ki</em> here introduces the reason for the command to listen. Keil’s translation (page 50) supports this view. Follingstad disagrees with this traditional causal interpretation of <em>ki</em>. According to his analysis in <em>Deictic Viewpoint of Biblical Hebrew Text</em> (on TW), which focuses on passages that are not analogous to Hosea and does not comment on this or other passages in Hosea, the primary function of <em>ki</em> is to shift the listener’s viewpoint to the content of the following proposition. However, Follingstad admits that “there often is a causal connection between the semantic contents of the clauses” (10.2.3).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Israel, hear the word of the LORD; for the Lord has a charge to bring against the inhabitants of the land: (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Hear the word of the LORD, O people of Israel; for the Lord has an indictment against the inhabitants of the land. (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions leave this connection implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Listen to the word of the LORD, you Israelites. The Lord has brought these charges against those who live in the land: (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a natural way in your language to translate the relationship between 4:1a and 4:1b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for the LORD has a case against the people of the land:</strong> This statement indicates that the LORD was making a very serious accusation against the people of Israel.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>case:</strong> This is the same word that the BSB translated as “rebuke” in 2:2. In Hebrew, it means “to fight with words,” as in a quarrel or a legal case.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions use an expression that refers to an actual trial. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Lord has filed a lawsuit against you (NLT96)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">But this verse may also refer to an informal accusation, so it is better to use a more general expression. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Lord has an accusation to bring against the people who live in this land.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The GNT translation could refer either to a legal accusation as part of a court case or to a non-trial setting.</span></span> (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the people of the land:</strong> This phrase refers to the inhabitants of the land of Israel.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>citizens of the country (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The NLT probably left the rest of the phrase implied because it is clear from both the preceding and following context.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:1a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to reorder these two clauses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1b</sup>The Lord has an accusation to bring against the people who live in this land. <sup>1a</sup>Listen, Israel, to what he says: (GNT)</p></blockquote></div><h4>4:1c–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>There is no truth, no loving devotion, and no knowledge of God in the land:</strong> In 4:1c–d, the LORD stated his charge. The people of Israel were guilty of these three crimes.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural to make explicit a human subject here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>No one is faithful or loyal or truly cares about God. (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“There is no truth, no loving devotion,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“There is not one faithful/dependable person <span data-bnType=\"implied\">here</span>, no one who shows love,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This is what he says:</span> “<span data-bnType=\"implied\">In this entire nation,</span> none <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of you Israelites</span> are trustworthy <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in your dealings with your fellowmen</span>.

Two possible objects are other people and God:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>There is no truth and no love <u>towards other people</u>.</p></li><li><p>There is no truth and no love <u>towards God</u>.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">If possible, you should translate in a way that allows either or both objects to be understood. If you need to make an object explicit in your language, it is recommended that you specify other people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Macintosh (page 127).</span></span> This better fits the context of 4:2 that lists cursing, lying, murder, stealing, and adultery. These are sins that the people committed against other people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Hubbard (page 97).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>truth:</strong> In Hebrew, this word describes a person who is honest and dependable in what he says and does. Some languages may have a single expression that has these meanings. In other languages, it may be appropriate to use more than one expression.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate the statement “There is no truth”:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>No one is faithful (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>There are no trustworthy people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>No one tells the truth or can be trusted</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>loving devotion:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>loving devotion</em> has several aspects of meaning:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>steadfastness, loyalty</p></li><li><p>love</p></li><li><p>kindness, mercy</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">A number of versions translate one aspect of the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>love (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>loyalty (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>kindness (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions have two aspects. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>faithful love (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>steadfast love (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be possible to express all three aspects. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>consistent/unchanging love and kindness</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this term in a way that fits naturally in the context. Here it may refer particularly to showing a concern for the needs of others. The LORD’s covenant with Israel required them to have this concern in response to the love that the LORD had shown to them.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Hubbard (page 97). TWOT (#698a) says God was obviously in a covenant relationship with Israel, and he expressed this relationship in eternal <em>ḥesed</em>, but <em>ḥesed</em> does not necessarily involve a covenant nor does it mean loyalty to a covenant. Rather, it is a kind of love, including mercy, close to the KJV rendering “lovingkindness.” Vine (page 142) insists that three basic meanings of the word always interact: kindness, steadfastness, and love. He says that <em>ḥesed</em> is not only a matter of obligation within a relationship; it is also generosity. It is not only a matter of loyalty, but also of mercy.</span></span></p><h4>4:1d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:1d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and no knowledge of God in the land!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>no one who knows <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and obeys</span> God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">anywhere</span> in your<sup>(plur)</sup> land/country.</p></li><li><p>and no one knows me or acknowledges <span data-bnType=\"implied\">my authority as</span> God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>no knowledge of God:</strong> The phrase <em>knowledge of God</em> means that a person knows God and has a relationship with him. He also knows who God is and what God wants his people to do. It is implied that a person who knows God will obey him. He will acknowledge God’s authority by his actions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In verses such as 2:20b, there is a difference of interpretation between “know” and “acknowledge.” Here (4:1d), both senses fit the context. Most English versions choose one sense or the other. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>no knowledge of God (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people do not acknowledge me as God (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If possible, translate in a way that allows or includes both senses of meaning. See the meaning lines in the Display for 4:1d for two examples.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>God:</strong> The Hebrew word here is <em>ʾelohim</em> and not Yahweh. Versions indicate this by translating this word as <em>God</em> and not as “LORD.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the land:</strong> This phrase also occurs in 4:1b. In some languages, it may be natural to translate this phrase explicitly both here and in 4:1b, as in the BSB. In other languages, it may be better to translate this phrase explicitly in only one of these places. For example, the CEV makes this phrase explicit only in 4:1b:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1b</sup>the Lord accuses everyone <u>in the land</u>! <sup>1c</sup>No one is faithful or loyal <sup>1d</sup>or truly cares about God. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The NLT makes this phrase explicit only in 4:1d:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>1b</sup>The Lord has brought charges against you, <sup>1c</sup>saying: There is no faithfulness, no kindness, <sup>1d</sup>no knowledge of God <u>in your land</u>. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">With any of these options, make sure that the meaning is clear in the context.</p>",

Since lying is the next sin listed in this verse, you should translate “cursing” in a way that clearly shows the difference between it and lying.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to Macintosh (page 129), the word “cursing” is one in a series of five distinct terms. It should not be understood in combination with “lying.” It does not mean that “oaths are imposed and broken.” In this context it means “to invoke a curse upon someone from God. When a person invokes such curses improperly, he makes wrongful use of God’s name. (Exodus 20.7).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>lying:</strong> The commandment against lying is in Exodus 20:16 and Deuteronomy 5:20. Here <em>lying</em> means to be dishonest in ways that are harmful to other people. This meaning includes deceiving people in order to cheat them and giving false testimony in a legal case.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>dishonesty (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>deception (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>murder:</strong> The commandment against murder is in Exodus 20:13 and Deuteronomy 5:17.

It implies that people commit violent crimes everywhere in the land.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT (#7754, sense #6a, c). Of the versions listed here in support of the second interpretation, only the NLT makes explicit the idea of violence increasing or spreading everywhere.

In 4:1–3, the LORD brought an accusation or charge against the people of Israel. The charge consisted of three parts. First, the LORD stated their crimes (4:1). Second, he presented the evidence of their crimes (4:2). Third, he announced the resulting judgment (4:3). The charge serves as a general introduction to the messages that follow in the remainder of chapter 4.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples of section headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lord’s Legal Case Against Israel (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lord Accuses Israel (ESV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>4:3a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:3a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Therefore the land mourns,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Because of all these <span data-bnType=\"implied\">wicked things that they have done</span>, the land will experience/undergo drought,</p></li><li><p>And so a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">terrible</span> drought will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">soon</span> make the land/ground <span data-bnType=\"implied\">groan with thirst. It will become</span> dry and barren.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Therefore:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase introduces the result of something that was said previously. The meaning here is that because of all the sins mentioned in 4:1–2, the land mourns.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And so (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This is why (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Therefore (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the land mourns:</strong> There are two ways to interpret this clause:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><u>The land of Israel is undergoing drought</u>. The word <em>land</em> is literal and refers to the land of Israel. The word “mourn” is figurative and refers to drought. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And so the <u>land will dry up</u> (GNT) <em>(CEV, GNT, GW, NCV, NJPS, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p><u>The people of Israel are mourning</u>. The word <em>land</em> is figurative and refers to the people living in the land of Israel. The word “mourn” is literal and refers to people mourning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This is why the <u>country is in mourning</u><span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Here the term “country is in mourning” is assumed to refer to the people of the country.</span></span> (NJB) <em>(NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions. It better fits the following context that describes animals dying. Drought is a logical cause of their death.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Hebrew form of the verb “mourn” (the imperfect) can indicate either present or future. So there are two ways to interpret this verse:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to the <u>future</u>. This is an announcement of future judgment. The imperfect tense indicates that the mourning had not yet begun. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And so the land will dry up (GNT) <em>(GNT, NET, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to the <u>present</u>. The imperfect tense indicates that the mourning was already occurring at that time. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Therefore the land mourns (NRSV) <em>(BSB, GW, NCV, NIV, NJB,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NJB translates “mourns” as present tense but translates the final verb in the sentence as future, “the fish in the sea will disappear.”</span></span> NLT, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The majority of versions use present tense here. However, interpretation (1) is recommended. This interpretation is supported by the occurrence of the same pattern elsewhere.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example, in Amos 3:2 as well as here, the word “therefore” is followed by an imperfect tense verb. In the Amos passage it is clear that the reference is to future judgment. Wood (page 184) supports a present judgment. Davies (page 116–117), McComiskey (page 58), Andersen and Freedman (page 340), and Macintosh (page 132–133) support the idea of a future judgment, though Andersen and Freedman do not exclude the idea of an actual drought.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, the verbs have either past or nonpast tense. Nonpast verbs refer to either present or future, as in Hebrew. If that is true in your language, a nonpast verb would be appropriate here.</p><h4>4:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and all who dwell in it will waste away</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and everything that lives here will die.</p></li><li><p>Nothing will survive/live,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and all who dwell in it will waste away:</strong> In Hebrew, a preposition that is attached to each group of animals in 4:3c indicates that all the animals will waste away along with the people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Van der Merwe (Biblical Hebrew Reference Grammar, 39.6 3iii beth comitantiae) and Waltke and O’Connor (Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax. “The Subordination of Nouns to the Verb by means of Prepositions,” page 119).</span></span> English versions make this clear in different ways:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a word or phrase such as “with,” “together with,” or “even.” The BSB and others do this. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>all who live in it languish; together with the wild animals… (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…everyone is wasting away. Even the wild animals…are disappearing. (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the same word, such as “die” for both people and animals. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…everything that lives on it will die. All the animals…will die. (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Combine the terms in 4:3b–c. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Every living creature is dying—people and wild animals, birds and fish. (CEV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a natural way in your language to make it clear that both people and animals are included in this judgment.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>waste away:</strong> Versions translate this term in two main ways:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><u>To become weak and exhausted</u>. This is the literal meaning of the term. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>will languish (REB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p><u>To die</u>. This Hebrew term probably refers to weakness that results in death.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT (#140) and Macintosh (page 133).</span></span> Some versions make this result explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>will die (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Either option is acceptable.</p><h4>4:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>with the beasts of the field and the birds of the air; even the fish of the sea disappear.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The wild animals, the birds, and even the fish will disappear/die.”</p></li><li><p>not animals, not birds, not even the fish.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with the beasts of the field and the birds of the air; even the fish of the sea disappear:</strong> These three types of animals, <em>beasts</em>, <em>birds</em>, and <em>fish</em>, are listed together to emphasize the animals that live in the three large regions of the earth—the land, the air, and the water.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Andersen and Freedman (pages 340–341).</span></span> This list of three types of animals is probably a figure of speech (synecdoche) that represents all animals.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the beasts of the field:</strong> This phrase usually refers to untamed animals. However, in this context, it may refer to all animals that live on the land.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wild animals (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>animals (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the birds of the air:</strong> As in 2:18a the phrase <em>of the air</em> may be redundant. So some English versions leave the words <em>of the air</em> implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>birds (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the fish of the sea:</strong> In Hebrew, a word that some versions translate as “even” precedes the phrase <em>fish of the sea</em>. This word emphasizes the great extent of the drought. It will be so severe that even bodies of water will dry up. As a result, the fish in them will die. Some versions do not include this emphasis. Others do include it. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>even</u> the fish in the sea will perish. (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you include this emphasis in your translation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Hebrew word translated as <em>sea</em> sometimes refers to the Mediterranean Sea, which forms the western boundary of the land of Israel. However, it can also refer to rivers and lakes as well as the sea. Here it probably means that the drought will affect the fish that live in the rivers and lakes within the land of Israel.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Macintosh (page 133).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In English, the words <em>of the sea</em> are redundant, because the word <em>fish</em> implies this idea. So some English versions leave the words <em>of the sea</em> implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>fish (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>disappear:</strong> In Hebrew, the word that the BSB translates as <em>disappear</em> can mean to perish or be removed.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BART interlinear.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate it:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and the fish of the sea are dying (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In this verse, “to die” or <em>disappear</em> are different ways of saying the same thing. The way in which the animals disappear is through death. Use a natural expression in your language to translate the idea of death in this context.</p>",

The LORD said in 4:1–3 that the people had committed terrible sins and that everything living in the land of Israel would undergo judgment. It would be reasonable to expect the LORD to blame the people. But instead, he gave a command not to blame them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to introduce this unexpected response:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Don’t accuse just anyone! Not everyone is at fault. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a natural way in your language to emphasize that this response was unexpected.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>contend…offer reproof:</strong> The Hebrew word translated <em>contend</em> is the verb form of the noun translated “case” in 4:1b. See the note on that verse. The meaning is similar here. The words <em>offer reproof</em> are a synonym of <em>contend</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be helpful to make explicit that the LORD is giving the command.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>my complaint is against you priests (GNT) <em>(CEV, ESV, GNT, GW, NAB, NET, NJB, NLT, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Masoretic Text has “your people are like those who bring charges against a priest.” <u>The LORD placed blame on the people</u> as a group, because they rebelled against the priest (as in Deuteronomy 17:12–13).

The singular form does not make explicit whether the LORD is speaking to just one priest or to priests as a group. The singular form can mean either.

Specifically, they will be destroyed.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If the metaphor of stumbling does not clearly express this meaning in your translation, here are some other ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Change the metaphor to a simile and make it explicit that <em>stumble</em> refers to punishment.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>I will destroy</u> them because of their lack of knowledge.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>are destroyed:</strong> In Hebrew, the form of this verb indicates that destruction will certainly occur. Some versions, such as the BSB, express this certainty by using present tense, as if the destruction has already begun. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>My people perish (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Other versions use future tense.

It indicates that the people do not know God. They also refuse to obey him. They do not show by their actions that they acknowledge his authority.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>for:</strong> This word introduces the cause of the people’s destruction.

He rejects them because they have rejected knowledge.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject:</strong> The repetition of the word <em>reject</em> emphasizes that the LORD’s response matches the priest’s offense.

See how you translated the similar phrases in those verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will also reject you as My priests:</strong> This statement means that the LORD will take away their status as his priests. He will not allow them to serve in that role.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this statement:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I shall reject you from my priesthood (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will refuse to let you be my priests (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you:</strong> Most scholars understand the word <em>you</em> here to be the priests who were first mentioned in 4:4b.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some scholars such as Lange (page 52) and Keil (page 78) suggest that “you” refers to the whole nation of Israel as a kingdom of priests. This interpretation is unlikely, since up to this point in this section the LORD has addressed the priests, and the pronoun “you” has consistently referred to the priests. Most other commentators understand “you” to refer to the priests. For example, see Wood (pages 185–186), Stuart (page 78), Macintosh (page 139), and Andersen and Freedman (page 353).</span></span> Some versions make the pronoun referent explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You priests have refused to acknowledge me (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In Hebrew, the pronoun <em>you</em> is singular. However, it probably refers to priests as a group, as in 4:4b. See the note there.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:6b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it is more natural to put the statement of rejection before the reason.

He ignores them because the priests have ignored God’s law.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you have forgotten the law of your God, I will also forget:</strong> The repetition of the word <em>forget</em> emphasizes that the LORD’s response matches the priest’s offense. See how you translated the similar situation in 4:6b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>forgotten:</strong> Here the word <em>forgotten</em> means to deliberately reject the instruction of the LORD. It does not mean to forget accidentally or temporarily.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to TWOT (#2383), to forget God is similar to not knowing God. Forgetting is not simply a lapse of memory. To forget God is to ignore his commandments (Deuteronomy 8:11). To forget God is to follow other gods (Deuteronomy 8:19); to forget God is to stand in fear of harm and danger, to live fretfully and timidly (Isaiah 51:13). To forget God is to challenge him (Psalm 106:13).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>rejected (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>refuse to obey (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>forsake (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the law of your God:</strong> In Hebrew, the word <em>law</em> means “teaching” or “instruction.” Although the word is singular it does not refer to only one law. It refers to the many instructions of the LORD.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the laws of your God (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>my teaching (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the teachings of your God (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will also forget your children:</strong> The phrase <em>forget your children</em> probably means that the LORD will not allow the sons of the priests to become priests.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Andersen and Freedman (page 354), Macintosh (page 139), and Hubbard (page 101).</span></span> Some versions make this idea explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I…will not acknowledge your sons as my priests (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will reject your descendants (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your children:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase is literally “your sons.” In some Old Testament contexts, the word “sons” refers to both sons and daughters. Here most versions translate this word as <em>children</em>. However, if your language requires you to specify the gender of the child, you should use “sons.” In this context, “your sons” can only refer to male descendants, because only men could become priests.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:6c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it is more natural to put the result before the reason. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will ignore your children, because you have ignored the law of your God.</p></blockquote><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:6b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to reorder and/or combine the parallel parts in these two lines. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You priests have refused to acknowledge me and have rejected my teaching, and so I reject you and will not acknowledge your sons as my priests.

Some versions make this idea explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The <u>more of you priests there are</u>, the more you sin against me (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, the word <em>multiplied</em> probably also refers to an increase in their prestige and power.

Some versions, such as the BSB, use past tense to indicate this. Other versions use present tense. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the more they sin against me (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a natural way in your language to indicate that the sinful pattern of behavior of the priests was already established.</p><h4>4:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>they exchanged their Glory for a thing of disgrace.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I will take away their high status <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as my priests</span>, and they will be humiliated/disgraced.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">So</span> I will change your<sup>(plur)</sup> dignity/honor into shame/disgrace.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse part is the result of 4:7a. The result of the priests’ increasing sinfulness is that the LORD will humiliate them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">therefore</span> will I change their glory into shame (KJV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So I’ll turn their honor into disgrace (Voice)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Most versions leave this relationship implied.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The ESV has been used as the source line for 4:7b, because it follows the textual recommendation regarding the pronoun “I” or “they.” It also follows the recommended interpretation regarding “glory” or “Glory.” Notice that the NET and NRSV followed textual option (2), but chose interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(ESV) I will change their glory into shame:</strong> There is a textual issue here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Masoretic Text has “<u>I will</u> exchange their glory.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The MT is supported by Hubbard (page 102), Keil (page 78), Macintosh (page 141), and Pusey (page 49). Wood (page 186) and McComiskey (page 63) follow the MT, but do not discuss the textual issue.</span></span> This statement continues the pattern that was set in 4:6. The pattern is that the LORD responds to the sin of the priests with a statement of judgment. Here the LORD’s judgment is that he will take away the glory of the priests and give them something disgraceful instead. <em>(CEV, ESV, GNT, GW, KJV, NASB, NCV, NJPS, REB, RSV)</em></p></li><li><p>An ancient scribal tradition has “<u>They have</u> exchanged their glory.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to the NET footnote on this verse, the Masoretic scribes intentionally made this change, because they believed that the received consonantal text was corrupt. This variant is also supported by Andersen and Freedman (page 355) and Stuart (page 72).</span></span> This tradition is followed by the Targum and by the ancient Syriac translation. In this context, it indicates that the priests rejected their Glory (God) and accepted something disgraceful instead. <em>(BSB, NET, NIV, NJB, NLT, NRSV)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1) along with most versions and commentaries. The MT makes good sense and fits the overall context of the LORD’s punishment of the priests.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>(ESV) their glory:</strong> There are two main ways to interpret this phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to the <u>glory or honor of the priests</u>. It may refer to their wealth and power or to the high status they enjoyed in the eyes of the people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>their dignity (NJPS)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your honor (GNT) <em>(CEV, ESV, GNT, GW, KJV, NASB, NCV, NET, NJPS, NRSV, REB)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Notice that the NRSV preferred “their” to “I” in the textual issue, but here it followed “glory” (small g). The NET also changed their preference in the interpretation issue. It has “their glorious calling.”</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to <u>God, the Glory of Israel</u>. This is the way this phrase is understood in Psalm 106:20 and Jeremiah 2:11. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>their Glory (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the glory of God (NLT) <em>(BSB, NIV, NJB, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions and commentaries. This interpretation better fits the context, because the previous high status of the priests contrasts with their shameful removal from the priesthood.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>(ESV) shame:</strong> In Hebrew, this word here means disgrace, humiliation, or dishonor. It is the opposite of glory and honor.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT (#2024a, <em>qalon</em>). See also BDB (#3519, page 459). It identifies sense 3 “honour, dignity of position” as being an antithesis to <em>qalon</em> in Hosea 4:7.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this whole verse part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will take away their honor and give them shame.

He then described his response to that behavior (4:9–11a).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">As in chapter 2, the Hebrew pronouns alternate between “you” and “she.” In 4:4–6 the LORD used “you” when speaking to the priests, but in 4:7–10, he referred to the same priests as “they.” The BSB uses the pronoun “they.” The GNT continues to use “you.” Use a natural way in your language to refer to the priests. Be consistent throughout this paragraph. It should be clear in your translation that the LORD is speaking here to the same group of priests as in 4:4–6.</p></div><h4>4:9a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:9a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And it shall be like people, like priest.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>In the future, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the proverb</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will come true that says,</span> ‘There will be no difference between what the priests experience and what the people experience.’</p></li><li><p>The time is coming when the same thing will happen to the priests and the people.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And it shall be like people, like priest:</strong> This verse part focuses on the LORD’s judgment against the priests because of their sins described in 4:8. It affirms along with 4:9b that he will punish them in the future in the same way as the people. There are three main ways to interpret the connection of 4:9a with 4:8.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It indicates a change of topic from the sins of the priests to the LORD’s future punishment. The specific relationship with 4:8 is left implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And it shall be like people, like priest (NRSV) <em>(BSB, ESV, GNT, KJV, NAB, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, NLT, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Verse 4:9a gives the expected result of 4:8. It is normal to punish sins. This result is specified with a word such as “So” or “Therefore.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So the priests will be punished like the people. (GW) <em>(CEV, GW, NJPS)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Verse 4:9a gives the unexpected result of 4:8. Most did not consider it normal for priests to be punished. This unexpected result is specified with the word “But.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But people and priest will fare alike. (REB) <em>(NJB, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions. This interpretation will allow your readers to understand either of the two results in addition to the change of topic.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>And it shall be:</strong> Here are some other ways to indicate the future fulfillment of this verse:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In the future,…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>A time is coming when…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>like people, like priest:</strong> This is a Hebrew proverb. It means that the people and the priests are alike in some way. In this context, it indicates that the LORD will judge the priests in the same way as the people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this proverb:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the priests will be punished just like the people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the priests will have no advantage over the people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You will suffer the same punishment as the people! (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The GNT uses the pronoun “you” as if the LORD is speaking directly to the priests. You will need to decide whether it is more natural here to use indirect speech or direct speech in your language.</p><h4>4:9b–c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:9b–c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(combined/reordered)</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I will judge them because of the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">evil</span> they have done.</p></li><li><p>In the future, I will punish you<sup>(plur)</sup> priests and give you what you deserve for your <span data-bnType=\"implied\">wicked/sinful</span> deeds.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">The ESV has been used as the source line for 4:9b, because it allows for the recommended interpretation. Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>9b</sup> <u>I will punish them</u> for <strong>their ways (ESV)</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>9c</sup>and <u>repay them</u> for <strong>their deeds</strong>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The parallelism emphasizes the LORD’s punishment for their sinful behavior.</p><h4>4:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I will punish both of them for their ways</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I will punish them for their <span data-bnType=\"implied\">wicked</span> way <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of life</span>.</p></li><li><p>I will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">show no favoritism when I</span> judge you<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">priests</span> for your <span data-bnType=\"implied\">sinful</span> behavior.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>them:</strong> In Hebrew, this pronoun is literally “him.” The immediately preceding referent is “priest” in 4:9a. It refers to the priests as a group.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Hubbard (page 101) says the singular pronoun refers to the chief priest, but on page 103 he says that the proverb refers to the “priesthood.” Most English versions and commentaries use plural forms, regardless of the interpretation they follow.</span></span> But the preceding context also mentions the people, so there are two ways to interpret the referent of <em>them</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to the priests. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will punish you and make you pay for the evil you do. (GNT) <em>(GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to both the priests and the people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will punish them both for what they have done (NCV) <em>(BSB, NCV, NET, NIV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most versions are ambiguous. They use the pronoun <em>them</em>. These versions include the ESV, GW, KJV, NAB, NASB, NJB, NRSV, and REB. If you can maintain the ambiguity in your language, you may do so. Otherwise, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This entire section (4:4–11a) focuses on the sinful priests and their punishment.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The first meaning lines in the Display will use an ambiguous pronoun. The second meaning lines will follow the recommended interpretation.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>punish…repay them:</strong> The term <em>repay</em> means to do something in exchange for what another person has done. Here <em>repay</em> is another way to say <em>punish</em>. In response to the evil behavior of the priests, the LORD will respond with punishment that is a fair exchange for their evil deeds.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:9b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to combine and/or reorder the parallel parts in these two lines. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will punish them for all their wicked deeds.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">See 4:9b–c (combined/reordered) in the Display for other examples.</p></div><h4>4:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and repay them for their deeds.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I will give them what they deserve for the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">evil</span> they have done.</p></li><li><p>Your<sup>(plur)</sup> punishment will be appropriate for your <span data-bnType=\"implied\">wicked</span> deeds.</p></li></ul></div>",

It included prostitution that was part of worship in false religions.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Stuart (page 80), Andersen and Freedman (page 362), Chisholm (page 1389), and Wood (page 186).</span></span> Here the term may refer partly to this type of prostitution. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You will worship the fertility gods (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, it probably refers more generally to any kind of prostitution as well as to other immoral behavior, such as adultery and fornication. Use a natural term in your language that refers to prostitution or to sexual immorality in general.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here as elsewhere in the book of Hosea, the term variously translated as <em>promiscuous</em> or some form of harlotry or prostitution can be understood both literally and figuratively at the same time. It refers literally to sexual sin and figuratively to the worship of false gods. If possible, translate the phrase so that the literal and figurative meanings can both be understood.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>not multiply:</strong> This phrase probably means to <em>not multiply</em> in numbers.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to Stuart (page 80), it may have a figurative meaning: they will not increase “in honor, prestige, or wealth.” The NLT phrase “gain nothing from it” probably includes this figurative meaning. Other versions normally cited in TN probably support the literal meaning “not increase in number” or “not have any children.”</span></span></p><h4>4:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For they have stopped obeying the LORD.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">These things will happen</span> because they have abandoned Yahweh</p></li><li><p>because you<sup>(plur)</sup> have forsaken me</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For they have stopped obeying the LORD:</strong> The word <em>For</em> introduces the reason for the results in 4:10a–b. The priests will experience the unexpected results of 4:10a–b, because they had deserted the LORD. In some languages, it may be more natural to put the reason before the results. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10c–11a</sup>They have stopped obeying the LORD for promiscuity. <sup>10a–b</sup>Therefore, although they eat, they will not be satisfied. Although they frequently sleep with prostitutes, their numbers will not multiply.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>they have stopped obeying the LORD:</strong> Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>My people have rebelled (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for they have abandoned the Lord (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you have turned away from me (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the LORD:</strong> Here the LORD speaks of himself using a third person reference: <em>the LORD</em>. If it is not natural in your language for someone to refer to himself in this way, you may make a first person pronoun (I/me) explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>you have turned away <u>from me</u> (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>have been unfaithful <u>to me, their Lord</u> (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:10d–12a</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">These lines contain interpretation issues that involve verse and paragraph boundaries as well as differences in the object(s) of the verb. Here is a comparison of the verse and paragraph breaks in the BSB, NIV, and the NRSV. The BSB has:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10c</sup>For they have stopped obeying the LORD. <sup>11a</sup>Promiscuity, <sup>11b</sup>wine, and new wine take away understanding. <sup>12a</sup>My people consult their wooden idols (BSB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The NIV has:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10d</sup>to give themselves <sup>11a</sup>to prostitution, <sup>11b</sup>to old wine and new, which take away the understanding <sup>12a</sup>of my people. They consult a wooden idol (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The NRSV has:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10d</sup>to devote themselves to <sup>11a</sup>whoredom.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>11b</sup>Wine and new wine take away the understanding. <sup>12a</sup>My people consult a piece of wood, (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">TN will first discuss the interpretation issue in 4:10d–11b. It will then discuss the issue in 4:11b–12a.</p><h4>4:10d–11b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">The NRSV has been used as the source line for 4:10d-11b, because it allows for the recommended interpretation.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(NRSV) to devote themselves to whoredom. Wine and new wine take away the understanding:</strong> There are three ways to interpret the object(s) of the Hebrew verb that the NRSV translates as <em>devote themselves to</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The object of the verb is the first term that follows it (prostitution).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The LXX and Syriac follow this interpretation.</span></span> With this interpretation, the next two terms (old wine and new wine), are the subject of the next verb (take away). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they have forsaken the Lord to devote themselves to whoredom. Wine and new wine take away the understanding. (NRSV) <em>(GNT, NAB, NJB, NJPS, NRSV, REB)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The GNT has the same structure as the other versions that follow interpretation (1). However, the GNT understands “prostitution” symbolically. It has: “you have turned away from me <u>to follow other gods</u>.”</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The objects of the verb are the three terms that follow it (prostitution, old wine, and new wine). With this interpretation, all three terms are also the subject of the next verb (take away). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they have left the Lord to give themselves to prostitution, to old and new wine, which take away their ability to understand. (NCV) <em>(ESV, NCV, NIV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The object of the verb is the term that precedes it (the LORD). With this interpretation, the three terms that follow the verb (prostitution, old wine, and new wine) are the subject of the next verb (take away). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they have stopped giving heed to the Lord. Harlotry, wine and new wine take away the understanding. (NASB) <em>(BSB, GW, KJV, NASB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions. It better fits the way that prostitution and wine are described in Hosea and the rest of the Old Testament.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Throughout the OT, Israel’s rejection of the LORD is closely linked with prostitution, both literal and spiritual. Wine is not connected with rejecting the LORD. Moreover, wine is often described as something that keeps people from thinking clearly. Prostitution is not usually described in those terms.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Another reason to follow interpretation (1) is that it has fewer grammatical difficulties than the other interpretations. The verb “take away” is singular in Hebrew. With interpretation (1), the nouns “new wine” and “old wine” agree with the verb, because they function as a single unit. With interpretations (2) and (3), all three nouns would not agree with the singular verb unless all three function as a single unit. That is improbable.</span></span></p><h4>4:10d–11a</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(NRSV) to devote themselves to:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase is a single word. Here it indicates that the priests enthusiastically gratify their sexual desires and worship idols.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(NRSV) whoredom:</strong> This word is a noun form related to the verb that the BSB translated as “be promiscuous” in 4:10b. See the note there.</p><h4>4:10d–11a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:10d–11a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Promiscuity,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>in order to devote themselves to prostitution <span data-bnType=\"implied\">instead</span>.”</p></li><li><p>in order to sleep with prostitutes and to worship other gods.”</p></li></ul></div>",

The repetition emphasizes the intoxicating effect of wine. The distinction in meaning between the two words for wine is not important here. So some versions have only “wine.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Wine</u> has robbed my people of their understanding. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">For translation advice on the word <em>wine</em>, see the note on 2:8b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>(NRSV) Wine:</strong> The Hebrew word that many English versions translate as <em>Wine</em> is the normal word for “wine.” It does not refer to wine that has been aged for a long time. In some languages, a phrase such as “old wine” may have a wrong connotation. If that is true in your language, you should simply use your term for “wine,” as the NLT has done.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(NRSV) take away the understanding. My people consult…:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the possible connection of the phrase <em>My people</em> to the word <em>understanding</em>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This issue of interpretation overlaps with a textual issue that involves the verse numbering. The Masoretic Text places the phrase <em>My people</em> at the beginning of 4:12. The LXX places the phrase at the end of 4:11. Unfortunately, the differences in verse numbering do not line up with the differences in meaning in the English versions. For example, the NIV places the phrase “of my people” at the start of 4:12, but connects it to the word “understanding” at the end of 4:11. The NET also translates this phrase as “understanding of my people,” but it places the entire phrase at the end of 4:11. To minimize confusion over differences in verse numbering, the Notes will discuss this issue in terms of the way it affects the meaning. The English versions will be listed according to how they connect the phrase “my people,” not according to where they divide the verse numbers.</span></span></p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The phrase <em>My people</em> <u>does not connect</u> to the previous word <em>understanding</em>. The phrase <em>My people</em> serves as the subject of the verb <em>consult</em> that follows it. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>take away the understanding. <u>My people consult</u>… (NRSV) <em>(BSB, ESV, GW, KJV, NASB, NCV, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The phrase <em>My people</em> <u>connects</u> to the previous word <em>understanding</em>. They are parts of a larger phrase: “understanding of my people.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>take away the <u>understanding of my people</u>. They consult… (NET) <em>(CEV, GNT, NET, NIV, NJB, NLT, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). In Hebrew, the position of the phrase <em>My people</em> in relation to the verb <em>consult</em> highlights the fact that it is God’s own people that consult idols.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to express this emphasis:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>My <u>own</u> people consult a piece of wood!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>(NRSV) take away the understanding:</strong> The Hebrew idiom that the NRSV translates as <em>take away the understanding</em> is literally “take away the heart.” The people of Israel considered the heart to be the center of thought and knowledge. To take away the heart meant to interfere with clear thinking. In this context, it meant that the people’s habit of drunkenness led to their lack of clear thinking regarding the LORD and his standards. See “lack of knowledge” under 4:6a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be necessary to make explicit whose understanding is being referred to. One way to do this is to refer to people in general. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Wine takes away people’s ability to understand.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Wine keeps a person from thinking clearly.</p></blockquote><h4>4:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>wine, and new wine take away understanding.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ “Wine takes away the ability of a person to understand <span data-bnType=\"implied\">right from wrong</span>.</p></li><li><p>¶ Yahweh continued to say, “<span data-bnType=\"implied\">Too much</span> wine destroys <span data-bnType=\"implied\">good</span> sense.</p></li><li><p>¶ “People cannot think clearly/properly <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when they are drunk</span> with wine.</p></li></ul></div>",

It is because a spirit of prostitution has led them away from him. Other translations leave this connection implied. Use a natural way in your language to introduce this reason.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a spirit of prostitution:</strong> In this context, this phrase probably refers to a strong desire to be immoral. It probably does not refer to a demon or evil spirit.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NIDOTTE (#8120), Macintosh (page 152), Davies (page 124), McComiskey (page 66), and Stuart (page 81) understand <em>ruaḥ</em> ”spirit” as a strong desire or tendency to act in a certain way. Andersen and Freedman (pages 366–367) prefer the idea of a demonic spirit that deceives people and “incites…promiscuity.”</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>an urge</u> to go whoring (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>leads them astray:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>leads them astray</em> is literally “has-caused-to-wander.” It indicates here that the people’s desire to be immoral has led or caused them to do what is wrong. The form of the Hebrew verb indicates that the people had been led astray in the past and were still being led astray. The BSB uses present tense to translate this idea. Some versions use past tense forms. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>an urge to go whoring <u>has led them astray</u> (NJB)</p></blockquote><h4>4:12d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:12d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and they have played the harlot against their God.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They have abandoned me in order to worship false gods.</p></li><li><p>They have turned away from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">me</span>, their God, and have rejected my authority.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and they have played the harlot against their God:</strong> In Hebrew, this clause is literally “and they have committed fornication<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The BART interlinear for 4:12d glosses this <em>qal</em> form of the verb <em>zanah</em> as “they have prostituted themselves.” NIDOTTE (#2388) glosses the <em>qal</em> form as “commit fornication, act as a harlot, have illicit intercourse.” TWOT (#563) and BDB (#2181) are similar. In 4:12d the verb refers figuratively to religious immorality or unfaithfulness to God.</span></span> from under their God.” It means here that the people rejected the authority of the LORD and devoted themselves to idolatry and self-indulgence instead.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:12c–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Some verse parts in the following context (4:13a–c) focus on idolatry. Other verse parts (4:13d–e) focus on the literal prostitution that was part of idol worship. If possible, your translation of “spirit of prostitution” and “played the harlot against their God” in 4:12c–d should include both meanings.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">It is suggested that you use at least one expression that refers to sexual unfaithfulness between people. Use other expressions that refer to idolatry or unfaithfulness to God. In the following examples, sexual unfaithfulness will be marked with an underline. Idolatry or unfaithfulness to God will be marked with bold print:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12c</sup>Their strong desire for <u>sexual pleasure</u> and <strong>idol worship</strong> has led them to abandon what is right. <sup>12d</sup>They <strong>have left their God to serve other gods</strong>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12c</sup>Their <u>uncontrolled lusts</u> have caused them to sin. <sup>12d</sup>They are no longer <u>faithful to one another</u> or <strong>to God</strong> .</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12c</sup>Like <u>prostitutes</u>, they have <strong>chased after other gods</strong> <sup>12d</sup>and <strong>have left their own God</strong>. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12c</sup>A <u>spirit of prostitution</u> leads them astray. <sup>12d</sup>They <u>commit adultery</u> by <strong>giving themselves to other gods</strong>. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">You may also want to clarify the relationship between literal and figurative prostitution in a footnote. Here is a suggested footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>People who worshiped idols at mountain shrines sacrificed animals and incense to the idols. As part of the ritual, they often had sex with the prostitutes who worked at the shrines (see 4:13–14). When they did this, they were acting immorally. They were also being unfaithful to God by worshiping other gods.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to reorder and/or combine the parallel parts in 4:12c–d. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Their longing for the pleasures of sexual immorality and idolatry has led them to abandon me, their God.</p></blockquote></div>",

They were stubborn and refused to return to the LORD. As a result, the LORD promised to discipline them so that in time they would be ashamed of their idolatry.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples of section headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lord Condemns Pagan Worship (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Worship in Israel is idolatrous and debauched (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The previous section focused primarily on the priests. This section focuses on the people as a group. A section heading may be appropriate here if you chose interpretation (1) in 4:10d–11b. In that case this section would begin with a new sentence. A section heading is not recommended if you chose interpretation (2) or (3), because the heading would interrupt a sentence.</p></div><h4>4:14a–b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:14a–b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(combined/reordered)</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">But</span> these <span data-bnType=\"implied\">young women</span> are not the ones I will punish.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>14a</sup>I will not punish <u>your daughters</u> when they <strong>prostitute themselves</strong>,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>14b</sup>nor <u>your daughters-in-law</u> when they <strong>commit adultery</strong>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">There is an ellipsis in 4:14b. In some languages, it will be necessary to supply the missing verb from 4:14a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>14b</sup>nor <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will I punish</span> <u>your daughters-in-law</u> when they <strong>commit adultery</strong>,</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In Hebrew, the parallel parts in these lines are identical to the parallel parts in 4:13d–e. In some languages, it is unnatural to repeat the same noun phrases two verses in a row. If that is true in your language, you could use one or more pronouns instead. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Yet I will not punish <u>them</u> for <u>this</u> (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will not punish:</strong> In this clause the pronoun <em>I</em> refers to the LORD. Some versions introduce this phrase with a word that indicates that this result is unexpected. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Yet</u> I will not punish (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>But</u> I won’t punish (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a natural way in your language to introduce this unexpected result.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>when…when:</strong> The word <em>when</em> in these parallel lines introduces the behavior that the LORD will not punish. He will not punish them when they are immoral. Another way to express this relationship is to use the word “for.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But I will not punish your daughters <u>for</u> becoming prostitutes (NCV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:14a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to combine these parallel statements into one line. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But I won’t punish them. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice that the CEV leaves the reason for the punishment (their immorality) implied in 4:14a–b. The CEV states their immoral behavior explicitly in 4:13d–e (quoted above).</p></div><h4>4:14a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:14a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I will not punish your daughters when they prostitute themselves,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yet/But</span> I will not punish your<sup>(plur)</sup> daughters for becoming prostitutes.</p></li></ul></div><h4>4:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I will also not punish your<sup>(plur)</sup> daughters-in-law for committing adultery.</p></li></ul></div><h4>4:14c–d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:14c–d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(combined/reordered)</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">No!</span> It is you<sup>(plur)</sup> men <span data-bnType=\"implied\">whom I will punish,</span> because you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">regularly</span> eat with the prostitutes when you sacrifice at the shrines, and then you have sex with them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>14c</sup>For the men themselves <u>go off</u> with <strong>prostitutes</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>14d</sup>and <u>offer sacrifices</u> with <strong>shrine prostitutes</strong>.</p></blockquote><h4>4:14c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:14c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For the men themselves go off with prostitutes</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Because you<sup>(plur)</sup> yourselves <span data-bnType=\"implied\">continue to</span> go aside/off <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to have sex</span> with prostitutes</p></li><li><p>You men are the ones who go sleep with prostitutes.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> This word introduces the reason that the LORD will not punish the young women for their immoral behavior. It is because he places the blame on the men of Israel. The men led the nation into idolatry, and their immoral behavior influenced the young women to become immoral.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the men themselves:</strong> The Hebrew pronoun that the BSB translates as <em>the men themselves</em> is literally “they<sup>(masc)</sup>.” The pronoun refers to the men of Israel. The following examples show different ways to translate the pronoun. All are acceptable:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“<u>the men</u>.” An example is the BSB above.</p></li><li><p>“your men.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>your men</u> resort to whores (REB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>“you men” or “you.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>You men</u> are to blame (CEV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Many versions also give emphasis by adding a word such as <em>themselves</em>. The BSB above is an example. Another example is the GNT:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you <u>yourselves</u> go off with temple prostitutes (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Express this emphasis in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>go off with prostitutes:</strong> This phrase probably means that each of the men separated from a larger group to be alone with a prostitute.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>go aside with harlots (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wandering off with whores (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase implies that the men had sexual relations with the prostitutes. Some versions make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>have sexual relations with prostitutes (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:14d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:14d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and offer sacrifices with shrine prostitutes.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>at the shrines and to offer sacrifices with them.</p></li><li><p>They are with you<sup>(plur)</sup> when you sacrifice animals at the places where people worship idols.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and offer sacrifices with shrine prostitutes:</strong> As part of the ritual, the worshiper offered an animal sacrifice at an altar and later ate some of the meat from the sacrificed animal. Shrine prostitutes were part of that ritual. She and the worshiper may have shared the sacrificial meal together. She also had sexual intercourse with him as part of the ritual.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>shrine prostitutes:</strong> This term refers to prostitutes who worked at the shrines where people worshiped idols.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this term:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>temple prostitutes (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>prostitutes who work at the pagan shrines</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:14c–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to combine these parallel statements into one line.

It is very similar to the statement “My people are destroyed from lack of knowledge” in 4:6a, although the context here is different. See the note on that passage.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This expression may have been a proverb that was familiar to the people of that time. Some versions make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>As the proverb says, ‘A people without sense will be ruined.’ (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a people without understanding:</strong> This phrase refers here to people who do not have spiritual or moral understanding. Such people refuse to understand God and the way he acts. This lack of understanding is equivalent to moral or spiritual foolishness.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Your own foolishness… (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>O foolish people!

But I do not want Judah to follow your example.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Though you prostitute yourself, O Israel, may Judah avoid such guilt:</strong> In this verse part the LORD mentioned the sexual immorality and idolatry of the people of Israel as a basis for giving an indirect warning to the people of Judah. He warned them not to become guilty of the same sins.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">These two clauses have a number of probable implications. It may be helpful to make some of the logical relationships explicit.</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The LORD knew that the people of Israel were prostituting themselves.</p></li><li><p>He expected that the people of Judah would follow Israel’s example and become guilty of the same sins.</p></li><li><p>But he did not want this to happen, so he warned Judah not to commit those sins.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">There is an implied contrast between what the LORD expected and his warning. In some languages, it may be more natural to express this contrast with a word such as “but.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You Israelites prostitute yourselves, <u>but</u> Judah must not become guilty of the same sin.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you prostitute yourself:</strong> The word that the BSB translates as <em>prostitute</em> is a different form of the same word that it translates as “be promiscuous” in 4:10b (see the note there). It probably refers here to both sexual immorality and unfaithfulness towards God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>O Israel:</strong> In this context, the direct form of address <em>O Israel</em> implies a rebuke. Use a form of address in your language that is natural to use in a rebuke.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>may Judah avoid such guilt:</strong> In this context, this phrase is an indirect command or warning to the people of Judah. It expresses the LORD’s desire that they not become guilty of the same sin as the people of Israel. It may also imply a rebuke. It is likely that some people from Judah already worshiped at idol shrines in Israel.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase is not a command to Israel that Israel must prevent Judah from becoming guilty. It is an indirect command to Judah.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A command to Israel to prevent Judah&apos;s guilt would use a second person verb addressed to Israel here. However, this verb is a third person jussive addressed indirectly to Judah. The jussive expresses the speaker&apos;s desire that a situation will occur or in this case, will not occur.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to express this meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Though you, Israel, play the whore, <u>there is no need for Judah to sin too</u>. (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Even though you people of Israel are unfaithful to me, <u>may Judah not be guilty of the same thing</u>.

The LORD told his people not to worship at these two places.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Do not journey to Gilgal, do not go up to Beth-aven:</strong> The LORD may have given this command to the people of Israel, the people of Judah, or both groups of people. Most English versions, including the BSB, are ambiguous. It is recommended that you follow the example of these versions and not specify who the command refers to.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Beth-aven:</strong> Bethel means “house of God.” The name <em>Beth-aven</em> means “house of wickedness.” The LORD used the name <em>Beth-aven</em> here to emphasize how evil Bethel had become.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Years earlier Bethel was a place for worshiping the LORD. Later Jeroboam set up a shrine with a golden calf there (see 1 Kings 12:20–33). From that time on it became a place for worshiping false gods.</span></span> See also 5:8 and 10:5.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you use the name <em>Beth-aven</em> in your translation and not “Bethel.” Some other ways that versions spell this name are Beth Aven and Bethaven.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is also recommended that you add a footnote to explain that the LORD substituted <em>Beth-aven</em> for “Bethel.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Bethel means “house of God.” Here the LORD called it Beth-aven, which means “house of wickedness.”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Do not journey…do not go up:</strong> The second of these parallel phrases is more specific than the first. It often refers to going uphill. Many verses speak of “going up” to Jerusalem, and Bethel was located at an even higher elevation. If your language uses a specific term for traveling uphill, you may want to use it here. However, in this context the uphill direction is not in focus. Both phrases refer to travel to a shrine for the purpose of worship.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this idea:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>Do not come</u> to Gilgal, <u>Do not make pilgrimages</u> to Beth-aven (NJPS)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>Don’t worship</u> at Gilgal or Bethaven (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>4:15c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:15c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and do not swear on oath, ‘As surely as the LORD lives!’</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And do not say, ‘<span data-bnType=\"implied\">I will keep my oath/promise</span> as surely as Yahweh lives.’</p></li><li><p>and do not make promises that you<sup>(plur)</sup> confirm by using my name, the name of Yahweh who lives.</p></li><li><p>And do not say, ‘I will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">certainly</span> fulfill my oath/promise. It is just as certain as the truth that Yahweh is alive.’</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and do not swear on oath, ‘As surely as the LORD lives!’:</strong> As the BSB clarifies, in this context, to <em>swear</em> means to make an oath or a promise. The Israelites used the expression <em>As surely as the LORD lives</em> as part of the oath. It was a guarantee that they would do what they promised. In the past, the LORD allowed them to use his name in this way because of his covenant relationship with them (see Deuteronomy 6:13, 10:20).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, the Israelites broke that covenant when they turned away from the LORD to worship idols instead. Since they did not honor him, the LORD told them to stop using his name to make an oath.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this sentence:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And quit making promises in my name—the name of the living Lord (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Do not…take oaths there in the Lord’s name.

There are two ways to interpret the function of this word:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It introduces the <u>reason for something that follows</u>. Israel is stubborn. For that reason, the LORD will no longer care for the people as a shepherd cares for his sheep. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>16a</sup> <u>Since</u> Israel is stubborn Like a stubborn heifer, <sup>16b</sup>Can the Lord now pasture them Like a lamb in a large field? (NASB) <em>(NASB, NIV, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It introduces the <u>explanation for a previous statement</u>. It was because of Israel’s stubbornness that they were forbidden to use the LORD’s name. It was also because of their stubbornness that they were immoral and worshiped idols. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>for</u> Israel is as stubborn as a stubborn heifer (NJB) <em>(BSB, KJV, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). It fits well with the logic of the verse, that Israel’s stubbornness is the reason for the LORD’s response in 4:16b. Many versions leave the reason implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Like a stubborn heifer, Israel is stubborn (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Israelites are stubborn, like a stubborn heifer. (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If is natural in your language to express this reason implicitly, you may do so.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>as obstinate as a stubborn heifer:</strong> This is a simile that compares the behavior of the people of Israel to that of a stubborn heifer/cow. A stubborn heifer refuses to follow the person that tries to lead it. Similarly, the people of Israel refuse to follow the LORD and obey him. It is recommended that you keep this comparison if the meaning is clear. If the meaning is not clear in your language, you may substitute a different comparison that has the same meaning and impact. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as stubborn as mules (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>heifer:</strong> This word refers to a young cow that has not given birth to a calf. Some languages may have a word that refers specifically to this kind of cow. In other languages, it may be necessary to use a more general word or phrase.

He compared the people of Israel to lambs in a large pasture. There are two ways to interpret this comparison:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is a rhetorical question. The implied negative answer is: “He cannot.” The Israelites were so stubborn that the LORD could not provide and care for them as a shepherd would lead and care for his sheep.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Macintosh (page 165), Wood (page 188), and Hubbard (page 109).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>can the Lord now feed them like a lamb in a broad pasture? (NRSV) <em>(BSB, CEV, ESV, GNT, GW, NAB, NASB, NIV, NJB, NLT, NRSV)</em> <em>This same interpretation can also be expressed as a statement. For example:</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so stubborn that I, the Lord, cannot feed you like lambs in an open pasture (CEV) <em>(CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is a statement of the LORD’s judgment. He compared the people of Israel to sheep in a wide land. The meaning is that he will scatter them to places where they would not be under his care and protection.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Keil (page 83), McComiskey (page 71), and Pusey (page 54).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so the Lord will put her out to pasture. She will stand alone and unprotected, like a helpless lamb in an open field. (NLT96) <em>(KJV, NCV, NET, NJPS, NLT96)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions. The image of a shepherd caring for sheep is a common one in the Old Testament. The image almost always has a positive connotation.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Support for interpretation (2) is also reasonable. The most important points in its favor are that this clause lacks an interrogative marker and that it is introduced by a Hebrew word “now” or “soon” that generally introduces a judgment. Nevertheless, these points are not conclusive. It is not unusual, even in Hosea, for a rhetorical question to be unmarked. Also, the word “now” does not always indicate a judgment. It can simply indicate a conclusion. Another argument against interpretation (2) is that there are no definitive examples in the Old Testament of the image of a shepherd caring for sheep in a wide place being used in a negative sense.</span></span></p>",

You have caused many people to be killed.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The rebels are deep in slaughter:</strong> There is a textual issue here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Masoretic Text has “and rebels have made deep slaughter/corruption.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And the revolters have gone deep into slaughter (ESV) <em>(BSB, ESV, GW, KJV, NAB, NASB, NET, NCV, NIV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Some scholars think that the original Hebrew text was “they have made deep the pit of Shittim.” This is a figure of speech that is similar to the trap metaphors in 5:1c. The meaning is also similar. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They have dug the ditch deep at Shittim (NJB) <em>(CEV, GNT, NJB, NLT, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1) along with most versions. It makes sense, fits the context, and does not require a different original text.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Scholars agree that the Masoretic Text is difficult to understand. Two of the three words, <em>śeṭim</em> “rebels” and <em>šaḥaṭah</em> “slaughter/corruption” occur only once in the OT, and the derivation of the second word is uncertain. However, option (2) involves at least three changes to the text, for which there is no clear evidence. For more details, see the NET footnote on TW or Macintosh (pages 178–181).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>The rebels:</strong> In this context, <em>The rebels</em> implies people who have rebelled against the LORD. It refers to the same groups of people that are referred to in 5:1a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>are deep in slaughter:</strong> There are different ways to interpret the Hebrew noun that the BSB translates as <em>slaughter</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Hebrew noun comes from a verb root that means “<u>kill, slaughter</u>.” The phrase <em>deep in slaughter</em> means that they are responsible for killing many people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The revolters are deeply involved in slaughter (NKJV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The rebels have <u>caused</u> many people <u>to be killed</u>. <em>(BSB, ESV, NET, NIV, NKJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Hebrew noun comes from a verb root that means “<u>corrupt</u>.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to TWOT (#2362b), “many modern commentators” suggest that <em>šaḥaṭah</em> “slaughtering” in the Masoretic Text should be changed to <em>šaḥatah</em> “destruction/corruption.” Morag, quoted in Macintosh (pages 179–180), gives another alternative. He argues that <em>šaḥaṭah</em> is simply a variant spelling of <em>šaḥatah</em>. None of the commentaries used in preparing these Notes recommended the textual change mentioned by TWOT. Of the lexicons consulted, HOL lists this word with the meaning “corruption.” BDB, TWOT, HALOT, and NIDOTTE list it with the meaning “slaughter.”</span></span> The phrase “deep in corruption” means that they are responsible for many evil deeds. It does not refer specifically to officials who take bribes or other government corruption. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You are deeply involved in sin. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The rebels have done many evil things <em>(NAB, NASB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Interpretation (1) will be used in the Display. It is supported by most of the lexicons. It also offers the most straightforward explanation of the word that is used in the Masoretic Text.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, you may also use interpretation (2). This interpretation is easier to apply to the people of Israel as a whole. It also closely matches a very similar expression in Hosea 9:9 that uses forms of the same Hebrew words.</p><h4>5:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but I will chastise them all.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Therefore I will discipline them all.</p></li><li><p>So I am going to punish all of you<sup>(plur)</sup>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will chastise:</strong> In this context, the word <em>chastise</em> means to punish someone in order to correct their bad behavior. The same word is used of a parent who disciplines a child. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>punish (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>them all:</strong> This phrase refers to both the leaders and the people of Israel. The GNT says “all of you” instead of <em>them all</em>. That is because the Hebrew text in 5:1 uses the pronoun “you” to refer to the leaders and people. The GNT uses the same pronoun here, since the LORD is speaking to the same people as in 5:1. Translate this phrase in a natural way in your language.</p>",

(ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>8c</sup> <u>Sound the alarm</u> at <strong>Beth-aven</strong> (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">These actions signaled that an enemy army was approaching. When an enemy army was near a city, the watchmen or soldiers who guarded the city blew a horn or a trumpet or in some way sounded an alarm. These three parallel lines emphasize that it was a time of war.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(ESV) Blow the horn…the trumpet…Sound the alarm:</strong> In this verse, the purpose of all three actions is the same. There are two main ways to interpret this purpose:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Their purpose was to <u>warn</u> the people. They gave a signal to the people that they should move to the safety of their city along with their flocks and cattle.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Macintosh (page 194).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“Blow the horn in Gibeah and the trumpet in Ramah. Give the <u>warning</u> at Beth Aven (NCV) <em>(CEV, ESV, GW, NAB, NASB, NCV, NET, NJPS, NRSV)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Most of these versions have “sound the alarm.” The implicit purpose of “sound the alarm” in these versions is probably to warn. However, it is also possible to interpret the purpose as a call to do battle.</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Their purpose was to summon their soldiers to <u>fight</u> against the enemy. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“Sound the trumpet in Gibeah, the horn in Ramah. Raise the <u>battle cry</u> in Beth Aven. (NIV) <em>(BSB, GNT, NIV, NJB, NLT, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions and commentaries. However, it is possible that the purpose was both to warn the people and also to summon their troops into battle.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>horn:</strong> The <em>horn</em> or “shophar” was an instrument made from a ram’s horn.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>trumpet:</strong> The <em>trumpet</em> was a long, slender instrument made of metal.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Sound the alarm:</strong> This command may refer to blowing into one of the instruments. It may also refer to shouting an alarm. In some languages, it may be necessary to indicate what the warning or alarm was about. If that is true in your language, try to use an expression that will allow for both interpretations (1) and (2). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Warn <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the people</span>…<span data-bnType=\"implied\">that their enemies are coming</span>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Give a signal <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to the people</span>…<span data-bnType=\"implied\">that they need to prepare for war</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(ESV) Gibeah…Ramah…Beth-aven:</strong> These three cities were located in the territory of the tribe of Benjamin. This territory was located between the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to Wood (page 191), Gibeah and Ramah were located near the northern border of Judah. Bethel was located near the southern border of Israel. See 1 Kings 12:28–29.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Beth-aven:</strong> Here <em>Beth-aven</em> probably refers to Bethel. The name <em>Beth-aven</em> means “house of wickedness.” Some alternate ways that versions spell this name are Beth Aven and Bethaven. See also the note on Beth-aven in 4:15b.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:8a–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to combine and/or reorder these parallel statements.

First the Notes will discuss the textual issue:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Masoretic Text has a phrase that means “<u>after/behind</u> you, Benjamin!” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We are behind you, Benjamin! (NJB) <em>(BSB, CEV, ESV, GNT, KJV, NAB, NASB, NCV, NIV, NJB, NLT, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The LXX has a phrase that means “<u>Tremble</u>, O Benjamin!” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Tremble in fear, O Benjamin! (NET) <em>(NET, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow textual option (1) along with most English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are three ways to interpret the Hebrew phrase that is literally “after/behind you, Benjamin:”</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Hebrew phrase “after/behind you, Benjamin!” is a <u>promise</u>. The people shouting this phrase are promising <u>to follow</u> the soldiers of Benjamin into battle. They will be allies with the tribe of Benjamin against a common enemy. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>we follow you</u>, O Benjamin! (ESV) <em>(BSB, ESV, KJV, NIV, NJB, NLT, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Hebrew phrase “after/behind you, Benjamin!” is a <u>rallying cry</u>. The people shouting this phrase are giving a signal to the army of Benjamin <u>to begin fighting</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Into battle</u>, men of Benjamin! (GNT) <em>(GNT, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Hebrew phrase “after/behind you, Benjamin!” is a <u>warning</u>. The people shouting this phrase are warning the people of Benjamin that the <u>enemy army is located behind them</u>. The enemy is at their border and is about to attack. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>look behind you</u>, Benjamin! (NRSV) <em>(CEV, NAB, NASB, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). However, interpretation (2) is also acceptable. Both interpretations indicate that it was time to fight the enemy.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The expression “after/behind you, Benjamin” is from the song of war of Deborah in Judges 5:14. The people of Hosea&apos;s time probably knew the expression well. However, the historical situation is different, so the participants may not be the same.</span></span></p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:8a–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In 5:8a–c the LORD is the speaker. He told the sentries to warn the people. In 5:8d there is a change of speaker. We do not know who promised to follow Benjamin, but clearly they were friends or allies. In some languages, it may be necessary to make the change of speaker explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>8d</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">The friends/allies of the people of Benjamin said,</span> “Men of Benjamin, we will follow you.”</p></blockquote></div>",

This oppression is the means by which the LORD judges them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the preceding context, the judgment on Ephraim clearly refers to a future event (see 5:7, 5:9). The following context (5:14) also refers to a future event. Here in 5:11a, Hosea describes the judgment as if it has already begun. Scholars have not been able to identify the exact historical context. So we do not know if this judgment refers to the same future event as in 5:9a or if it refers to a different event that has already begun.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Scripture records three invasions of Israel by Assyria: one during the reign of Menahem (2 Kings 15:19–20), one during the reign of Pekah (2 Kings 15:29), and the final defeat and exile of Israel during the reign of Hoshea (2 Kings 17:5–6). Hosea served as a prophet during this entire time.</span></span> Examples of both options are given in the following note on “oppressed, trampled.” You may choose either option.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Ephraim:</strong> In this context, the tribe of <em>Ephraim</em> probably represents all the people of the nation of Israel. See the note on Ephraim…Israel at 5:3a–b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>oppressed, crushed:</strong> The words that the BSB translates as <em>oppressed</em> and <em>crushed</em> have almost the same meaning in this context. Both words are passive forms that refer to people who are being mistreated or caused hardship by their enemies.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The translations <em>crushed</em> and “trampled” are both figurative. They do not refer here to literal crushing or trampling. Use one or more literal or figurative terms in your language that refer to oppression.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this whole clause using passive forms:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Israel is crushed by the punishment (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The people of Israel will be crushed and broken by my judgment (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be necessary to use active forms and to make explicit who oppresses the people of Israel and who judges them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate this clause using active forms:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The time <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for me</span> to punish the people of Israel has arrived. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I will send their enemies</span> to cause them great hardship and suffering.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The enemies of</span> Israel oppress and mistreat them as a result of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">my</span> judgment against them.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in judgment:</strong> This phrase indicates that the LORD allows an enemy to oppress and trample the people as his judgment or punishment against them.</p><h4>5:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for he is determined to follow worthless idols.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because they persist in worshiping idols.</p></li><li><p>for they have decided to do what is worthless.

Some versions translate this word as “because” (RSV). Other versions leave it implied. Use a natural way in your language to introduce this reason.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>determined to follow:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase is more literally “he was determined to walk after.” It means that the people had made a deliberate decision to follow something.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BART interlinear.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>having <u>deliberately</u> followed (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>decided</u> to follow (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>worthless idols:</strong> There are several textual and interpretation issues involving the Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>worthless idols</em>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Textual options followed by one or more English versions are: 1) The LXX, Targum, Peshitta, and Vulgate follow an emended text (<em>šawʾ</em>) that means “vanity,” “emptiness,” “futility,” or “worthlessness.” The NRSV, NJPS, and REB follow this text. 2) The ESV and NAB have “filth,” derived from the assumed root <em>ṣwʾ</em> “filthy” (TWOT #1884). 3) The MT has <em>ṣaw</em>. This anomalous form occurs elsewhere only in Isaiah 28:10, 13, where it may represent a nonsense syllable or mimicry. The NASB and KJV understand it to mean “command” (derived from <em>ṣawah</em>), perhaps referring to Jeroboam’s establishment of idol worship at Bethel and Dan in 1 Kings 12:28–29. See TWOT (#1887c).</span></span> (See the preceding and following footnote for details). None of the textual choices literally means <em>idols</em>. However, in this context, most of the choices refer to idol worship, which was both worthless and filthy in the sight of God.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Most English versions, including the BSB, CEV, GW, NCV, NET, NIV, and NLT, interpret one of the textual options to refer to idols. In other passages, idol worship is described as being worthless and filthy, and Jeroboam’s command resulted in the people of Israel turning to idol worship. The NJB has “a Lie.” The GNT has “going for help to those who had none to give.” Both of these versions may be specific applications of the text followed by the LXX.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this verse part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>worshiping useless idols (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>pursuing what is worthless (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>follow idols (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>determined to go after filth (ESV)</p></blockquote>",

See the General Comment on 5:12a–b for other ways to translate these parallel similes.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>moth:</strong> The word <em>moth</em> refers here to a destructive kind of moth that makes holes in clothing.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some scholars (e.g., Stuart, page 105; Macintosh, page 207) think that this word is derived here from an Arabic root that means “pus.” For example, the REB translates it as “festering sore.” However, this meaning does not occur elsewhere in the OT. It is recommended that you follow the normal meaning for this Hebrew word.</span></span> In some languages, there may not be a word for this kind of moth. If that is true in your language, you may use a word that refers to something with a similar function. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>worm/insect</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>decay:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the parallel word <em>decay</em> here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to something that causes wood to decay, become soft, or fall apart.

In three out of five other verses that use the same Hebrew for “rot/rottenness,” it refers to rottenness of the bones.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Hebrew word <em>raqab</em> occurs five times in the OT. Proverbs 12:4 and 14:30 and Habakkuk 3:16 refer specifically to rot or decay of the bones. Job 13:28 and Hosea 5:12 do not specify. According to the Hebrew viewpoint in OT times, the bones were the source of bodily health and strength. People sometimes described physical or emotional suffering in terms of weakness or rottenness in their bones (NIDOTTE, #6795).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Ephraim…the house of Judah:</strong> The word <em>Ephraim</em> has the same meaning here as in 5:11a.

He also accused them of various kinds of sin. In 5:12–15, the LORD compared his judgment to destructive things like a moth, wood rot, and a lion. He assured the people that they would be destroyed in spite of their attempt to get help from Assyria. We do not know with certainty the date and the details of the war. However, some scholars believe that this is the war that is mentioned in 2 Kings 16:5–9 and 2 Chronicles 28:5–23.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This may be the Syro-Ephraimite war, 735–732 B.C.E.

In these similes, the LORD compares himself to a lion that attacks and destroys his prey.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> This word introduces the reason that the king of Assyria cannot heal Ephraim and Judah. It is because the LORD himself is the one who attacks and destroys them like a powerful animal.

The BSB translates the second word as <em>young lion</em>, but the word probably has nothing to do with the lion’s age.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Hubbard (page 124). See also TWOT (#2363a) for the first term and TWOT (#1025a) for the second term.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">There is no need to translate these two terms in different ways unless it is desirable for poetic style. In this context, the two terms function together to convey the idea of a dangerous and powerful animal that the Hebrew people greatly feared.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>lion</em> occurs figuratively in both the OT and NT, so it is recommended that you keep this figure of speech if possible.

Since he is in control, no one is able to rescue them from his judgment.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I:</strong> In Hebrew, the pronoun <em>I</em> is repeated, literally “I, I.” It also occurs in an emphatic position in the clause.

The next phrase continues this description. No one will be able to rescue them from the lion that tears them to pieces. A lion kills and destroys. Similarly, the LORD will cause the people of Israel and of Judah to suffer and die. He will do that by giving their enemies the power to defeat them in war.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>go away…carry them off:</strong> The parallel phrases <em>go away</em> and <em>carry them off</em> describe the same event.

In Leviticus 5:3–5 and 6:4, the NRSV and a few other versions translate this word as “realize guilt” or “become aware of guilt.” But these verses refer to a situation in which a person finds out that he has become unclean or committed a sin. It is not a matter of admitting a wrong that the person knew about all along. In Leviticus 5:5 a different Hebrew word is used for “confess sin.”</span></span></p></li><li><p>This word occurs elsewhere in Hosea with the sense “bear the consequences of guilt.” See 10:2 and 13:16.</p></li><li><p>This sense fits the message of Hosea very well.

The LORD has also warned them repeatedly that he was going to punish them.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>until they have suffered their punishment (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>until they have borne the consequences of their sin</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(NCV) In their trouble:</strong> This phrase is parallel to the clause “they suffer for their guilt.” These parallel ideas both refer to the suffering of the people of Israel and Judah. Their suffering is a result of the LORD’s judgment against them. See 5:12–14.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in their misery (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in their suffering (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(NCV) turn back to me…they will look for me:</strong> These statements are more literally:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they will seek my face…they will earnestly seek me (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">These parallel statements refer to a time when the people will turn to the LORD to follow him.

They must turn to the LORD to do what is right and good.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In many languages, it will be necessary to specify the speaker(s) of these words. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The people say, “…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They will say, “…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Come:</strong> In this context, the word <em>Come</em> has more than one function:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is an exclamation that encourages people to listen.</p></li><li><p>It strengthens the invitation “let us return to the LORD.”</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It does not mean that the people are to move closer to the speaker.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If the word <em>Come</em> is not understood correctly in your language, here are some other ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Leave it implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Let’s return to the Lord. (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Substitute a different word that has the same function in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Listen!</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>let us return:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase expresses a plea. This phrase does not mean “allow us to return.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We<sup>(incl)</sup> should return</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It will be good if we<sup>(incl)</sup> return</p></blockquote><h4>6:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For He has torn us to pieces, but He will heal us;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For it is he who tore us<sup>(incl)</sup> into pieces, but <span data-bnType=\"implied\">now</span> he will heal us.</p></li><li><p>He is the one who tore us apart <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like a lion tears its prey</span>, but he will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">also</span> restore our health.</p></li></ul></div><h4>6:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He has wounded us, but He will bind up our wounds.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He caused us injury, but he will bandage our<sup>(incl)</sup> wounds.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yes,</span> he injured/wounded us, but he will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">also</span> bandage/treat our<sup>(incl)</sup> wounds.</p></li></ul></div><h4>6:1b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">The clauses in this verse contrast with the similar ones in 5:13. In that verse, the people turned to the king of Assyria to heal their wounds, but the king could not heal them. Here the people understand that no human king can heal them, only the LORD.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1b</sup>For <u>He has torn us to pieces</u>, <strong>but He will heal us</strong>;</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1c</sup> <u>he has wounded us</u>, <strong>but He will bind up our wounds</strong>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In these lines, the people acknowledge that the LORD has punished them (underlined parts). At the same time, they express confidence that the LORD will show compassion and heal them (parts in bold print).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Verse 6:1b–c gives the reason for the plea in 6:1a. The reason that the people should return to the LORD is because he will heal them. The BSB follows the Hebrew in using a conjunction to indicate that 6:1b–c is the reason for the plea.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some versions let the context imply the correct relationship. Use a natural way in your language to indicate that 6:1b–c is a reason for the plea in 6:1a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He has torn us to pieces…He has wounded us:</strong> These parallel clauses refer back to 5:14, where the LORD compared himself to a lion. A lion tears apart his prey. Similarly, the LORD had caused them to suffer severe punishment for their sins.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In Hebrew, <em>He</em> (in 6:1b) is an emphatic pronoun. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>He himself</u> has torn us to pieces, but he will heal us! (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a natural way in your language to indicate this emphasis on the LORD.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but He will heal us…but He will bind up our wounds:</strong> There are several ways to interpret the relationship between the underlined parallel parts (<u>He has torn us to pieces</u>…<u>he has wounded us</u>) and the parts in bold print (<strong>He will heal us</strong>…<strong>He will bind up our wounds</strong>). Most versions use the same relationship in both lines, so the examples will show only the first line (6:1b).</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The LORD will heal the people. This is a <u>contrast</u> with the hurt that the LORD caused them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He has hurt us <u>but</u> he will heal us (NCV) <em>(BSB, CEV, GNT, NAB, NASB, NET, NIV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Although the LORD caused hurt, yet he will heal. Some versions use a conjunction to indicate that this is a <u>concession</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Even though</u> he has torn us to pieces, he will heal us. (GW) <em>(GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The LORD will heal the people. This is in <u>addition</u> to the hurt that the LORD caused them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He has rent us <u>and</u> he will heal us (NJB) <em>(KJV, NJB, NJPS, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The LORD will heal the people. This is the <u>purpose</u> of the hurt the LORD caused them. Some versions use a conjunction to indicate that this is the purpose. For example:<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The ESV has “and” in 6:1c.</span></span></p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for he has torn us, <u>that</u> he may heal us (ESV) <em>(ESV, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions. But interpretation (2) is also acceptable. Both interpretations clearly show the contrast between hurting and healing.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>McComiskey’s translation (page 83) uses “but.” Pusey (page 67) prefers “purpose.” Davies (page 160) says that in prose this construction would indicate purpose but that in poetry it may indicate &quot;a simple future.” Macintosh (page 216) translates 6:1b as “he who has mauled us shall heal us.” Hubbard (page 125) favors a concessive relationship.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural to leave the relationship implied and not have an explicit conjunction here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He has torn us to pieces; now he will heal us. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a natural way in your language to show the contrast between the LORD hurting the people and healing them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>heal us…bind up our wounds:</strong> These parallel phrases refer to healing a person who is sick or caring for a person who is injured. In this context, they indicate that the LORD will restore the people to good health.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate these phrases:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>heal us…bandage us (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>make us well and bandage our wounds (CEV)</p></blockquote>",

See the note on “let us return” in 6:1a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>know…to know:</strong> The Hebrew verbs that the BSB translates as <em>know</em> have more than one meaning related to knowing, experiencing, and understanding. There are two main ways to interpret the word <em>know</em> here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means that <u>the people should know the LORD</u> in an intimate, personal way. It implies that they should understand the LORD’s character. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Let us know, let us strive to know Yahweh (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Let’s learn about the LORD.

(NET) <em>(NET, NIV)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NJPS has: “Let us pursue obedience to the Lord, and we shall become obedient.” To “acknowledge” the LORD involves obedience, so perhaps NJPS could be listed under this interpretation.</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions. This is the same interpretation as in 2:20b, although the context there focuses more on a marriage relationship.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages have different words for knowing someone personally and knowing facts about someone. If that is true in your language, you should use the word that refers to a personal relationship.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>let us press on to know the LORD:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>let us press on</em> is literally “let us pursue” It means to fervently strive to know him.

The first word is literally <em>rain</em>. It usually refers to rain in general, whereas <em>spring showers</em> refers specifically to rain that falls at a particular time of year. There are two ways to interpret the first word:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to rain or showers in general. It does not indicate the time of year when it rains. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he will come to us like rain (NCV) <em>(BSB, CEV, ESV, KJV, NAB, NASB, NCV, NJB, NJPS, REB, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers specifically to autumn or winter rains. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will come to us like the autumn rains (GW) <em>(GW, NET, NIV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The BSB follows interpretation (1), but you may follow either interpretation. There are several reasons why either interpretation is valid:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>In Hebrew parallelism, a general statement commonly precedes a specific one.</p></li><li><p>The general term <em>rain</em> probably includes both the earlier and later times of rain. In Israel, rain commonly fell at planting time in October-November and also when the crops were ripening in March or April.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to Macintosh (page 225), the word <em>gešem</em> (rain) “is a comprehensive term denoting rainfall and therefore includes the phenomena of Israel/Palestine, viz. the former and the latter rains, respectively of winter and spring. Of these the latter rain <em>malqoš</em> (‘spring showers’) alone is here named.” See also Pusey and Wood, who both mention the two seasons of rainfall in Israel. However, many other commentaries focus on the spring rains as the primary reference of the general term. These include Hubbard, Stuart, Dearman, and McComiskey. See also TWOT (#1127b).</span></span></p></li><li><p>With either interpretation, the point of the simile (the regularity and benefits of rain) is the same.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">In different areas of the world, periods of rainfall are referred to in different ways. People may also expect rain at different times of the year. If that is true in your language area, you may use more general terms. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He will come to us like the rain/showers that the crops need.</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:3c–e</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to combine some of the verse parts. For example the GNT combines 6:3d and 6:3e:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>3c</sup>He will come to us as surely as the day dawns, <sup>3d–e</sup>as surely as the spring rains fall upon the earth.

He expressed his despair over the way that the people truly behaved. He also told them what he desired from them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be helpful to make explicit the contrast between this paragraph and 6:1–3.

(NLT96)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>What shall I do with you…What shall I do with you:</strong> These two clauses are rhetorical questions. Their function is to express the LORD’s frustration and hopelessness with the people of Israel and Judah. They are not requests for information.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate these rhetorical questions:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>As rhetorical questions.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>4d</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">your loyalty is</span> <u>like the early dew that vanishes</u>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">These lines explain the source of the LORD’s frustration with the people of Israel and Judah. They contain figures of speech (similes) in which he compared their love to morning mist and dew. The love that the people had for him and others was not dependable. It was similar to morning mist and dew because it quickly disappeared.

However, both the immediate context and the overall theme of Hosea focus on the people’s unfaithfulness to their covenant relationship with God. NIDOTTE (#2876) specifically cites Hosea 6:4 as an example of “the human response to God.” Wood (page 194) also notes that the basis of the indictment against Israel and Judah is that their love “for God” was unstable.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a morning mist:</strong> This phrase probably refers to low-lying clouds or fog that disappears by the time the morning is over.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a morning cloud (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>like fog in the morning (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>6:4d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:4d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>like the early dew that vanishes.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It is like the dew that disappears early in the day.</p></li><li><p>or dew that can be seen early in the morning, but soon it vanishes.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the early dew that vanishes:</strong> In some languages, it may be redundant to make the word <em>early</em> explicit.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the dew that quickly disappears (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>disappears like dew in the sunlight (NLT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:4c–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Some versions make explicit the point of comparison in both similes.

He disciplined them severely.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The historical context indicates that he disciplined the people many times over a period of many years. Some English versions use past tense verbs here to allow this understanding. However, the Hebrew verbs in this verse have imperfect tense/aspect, which commonly indicates a present or future time reference.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Translate this in a natural way in your language to indicate it happened regularly over a long period of time and will continue to happen.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Verse 6:4 used the second person pronoun “you” to refer to Ephraim and Judah.

The plural subject “your judgments” in the MT does not fit the singular verb “goes forth.” For more details, see Andersen and Freedman (page 429), Hubbard (page 127), Keil (page 99), McComiskey (pages 91–92), and the NET footnote.</span></span> It compares the way that the LORD’s judgment goes forth to lightning.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In Hebrew, the word the BSB translates here as <em>lightning</em> can refer to the light of day, dawn, lightning, or a lamp, among other things.

Scholars who support interpretation (2) understand the point of similarity to be “brilliance and pervasiveness” (McComiskey, pages 91–92), “clear” (Pusey, page 66), or “public recognition” (Davies, page 168).</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The simile indicates that the LORD’s judgment <u>destroys</u> people.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and my judgment goes forth as the light (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you translate in a way that allows your readers to understand more than one point of similarity. If you need to make the similarity between judgment and lightning/light explicit, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This interpretation is similar to 6:3c, which compares the LORD’s coming to the certainty of dawn.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this interpretation:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will punish you as certainly as the arrival of the dawn/daylight.</p></blockquote>",

That paragraph described a time when the people would truly repent. Here in 6:4–6, the LORD told the people of Israel and Judah how unreliable their love was. He expressed his despair over the way that the people truly behaved. He also told them what he desired from them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be helpful to make explicit the contrast between this paragraph and 6:1–3. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>But</u> you, Ephraim, What am I to do with you?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Yet</u> you people of Ephraim <u>do not seek to know me</u>. What can I do with you?</p></blockquote></div><h4>6:6a–b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:6a–b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(combined/reordered)</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For it is not your<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">animal</span> sacrifices that I care about.

He told them the reason for his frustration and the motive for his discipline. The Hebrew text and some English versions indicate explicitly that this verse is an explanation or reason. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>For</u> I desire steadfast love…. (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions rely on the context to clarify the relationship between the previous verses and this one. They do not indicate the relationship explicitly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I want your constant love, not your animal sacrifices. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a natural way in your language to indicate that this verse tells the reason for the LORD’s feelings and actions in the previous verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings:</strong> In these lines, the LORD told the people of Israel what was important to him. He wanted them to faithfully love him and one another. He also wanted them to show by their attitudes and actions that they truly knew him. Otherwise, he would not accept their sacrifices and burnt offerings.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is implied from the previous context that the people did not show that they truly knew him. It is also implied that the kind of sacrifices and burnt offerings that the LORD rejected were mere rituals. He did not want the people to offer sacrifices at all, if the sacrifices were not accompanied by a loving relationship with him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">You may want to add a footnote that cross-references 1 Samuel 15:22 and Psalm 51:16–19. These verses have similar ideas.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>mercy:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>mercy</em> is the same word that it translates as “loving devotion” in 4:1c. See the note on that verse for the different aspects of meaning. Here it may refer particularly to faithful love for God that results in a concern for others. Translate this term in a way that fits naturally in the context.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the knowledge of God:</strong> See the notes on 4:1d and 5:4c, where this phrase has the same meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>God:</strong> The Hebrew word here is <em>elohim</em> and not Yahweh. Versions indicate this by translating this word as <em>God</em> and not as “LORD.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>sacrifice…burnt offerings:</strong> The parallel terms <em>sacrifice</em> and <em>burnt offerings</em> refer to animal sacrifices that the people offered to God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>sacrifice</em> is the general word for an offering to God. The phrase <em>burnt offerings</em> refers to animals that were completely burned as offerings to God.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:6a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to reorder and/or combine the parallel parts in these two lines.

In contrast to the people’s future repentance (6:1–3), he gave examples of their current disloyalty and corruption, including their reliance on other nations instead of him. They continued to commit sins, and they refused to seek him. He announced that he would judge them, and he illustrated his coming judgment in various ways.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In this section, the Hebrew text sometimes uses second person pronouns (“you”) and sometimes third person pronouns (“they” or “he”) to refer to the people of Israel. The BSB follows the Hebrew pronoun usage. It uses “they” in 6:5–10, “you” in 6:4 &amp; 11, and “they” or “he” in 7:1–16. Throughout these verses the LORD is the speaker, and he either addresses the people directly or speaks about them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">English versions all use “you” in 6:11 and “they” in chapter 7, but they differ in the way they use the pronouns in 6:5–10.

Some versions indicate this contrast explicitly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>But</u> they broke the covenant at Adam (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions do not indicate this contrast explicitly. Instead they let the context imply the relationship between the previous verse and this one. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>At Adam they broke the covenant (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a natural way in your language to indicate this contrast.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(NRSV) at Adam:</strong> There are several textual and interpretation issues here.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See footnote (a) in the NET for details.</span></span> The notes will discuss only the main options. It will be helpful to remember that in Hebrew, the word <em>Adam</em> (<em>ʾadam</em>) does not have a capital letter.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some scholars think that the original text had the phrase “<u>at</u>-Adam.” It means that <u>the people had broken the covenant at the town of Adam</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>At a place named Adam (CEV) <em>(CEV, GNT, NABRE, NET, NIV2011, NJB, NRSV)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The REB also understands this as a place name.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But like Adam they transgressed the covenant (ESV) <em>(BSB, ESV, GW, NASB, NCV, NIV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Masoretic Text has “<u>like</u> Adam.” It means that <u>the people had broken the covenant like all</u> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">sinful</span> <u>men</u> do.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This option (“man/mankind”) is supported by the Septuagint (LXX).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But they like men have transgressed the covenant (KJV) <em>(KJV, NJPS)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The Display will follow option (1) along with many versions and scholars. It forms a better parallel with the word “there” in 6:7b. It also fits well with the place names that Hosea mentions in the two following verses.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to several scholars, the OT does not use the word “covenant” in relation to God’s command to Adam, nor do any OT prophets use Adam and Eve’s disobedience in the Garden of Eden as an example of God’s judgment on sin. In addition, outside of Genesis 1–5, the person’s name Adam almost never occurs. See NIDOTTE (#132), Davies (page 171), Macintosh (pages 236–239), and Hubbard (page 128).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, option (2) is also supported by many versions and scholars. You may want to follow this option if it is followed by a major language translation in your area.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Whichever option you choose, it is recommended that you put the other option in a footnote. For example, if you choose option (1), here is a suggested footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Some scholars think that the original Hebrew text had “at Adam.” The Masoretic Text has “like Adam.” In Hebrew, the word “like” looks almost the same as the word “at.” According to Joshua 3:16, the Jordan River backed up as far as Adam. Adam was a town in the Jordan Valley on the way to Shechem.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you choose option (2), here is a suggested footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Masoretic Text has “like Adam.” In Hebrew, the word “like” looks almost the same as the word “at,” so another way to translate this phrase is “at Adam.” According to Joshua 3:16, the Jordan River backed up as far as Adam. Adam was a town in the Jordan Valley on the way to Shechem.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(NRSV) they transgressed the covenant:</strong> The word <em>covenant</em> probably refers to the covenant that the LORD made with Moses on Mount Sinai. That covenant included the people’s promise that they would obey his laws. See Exodus 19:5–8. This clause means that the people disobeyed the laws that they and their ancestors had promised to obey.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they violated my covenant (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>breaking our agreement (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>they:</strong> The pronoun <em>they</em> probably refers to the people of Israel. Hosea makes it explicit elsewhere that the people are guilty of breaking the LORD’s covenant with them. See 8:1. However, it is also possible that it refers to the priests who are mentioned in 6:9. If possible, translate the pronoun in a way that can refer to both the people and the priests.</p><h4>6:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>there they were unfaithful to Me.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They betrayed me there.</p></li><li><p>There <span data-bnType=\"implied\">at Adam</span> you<sup>(plur)</sup> were disloyal to me.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>there they were unfaithful to Me:</strong> This clause refers to the event mentioned in 6:7a. When the people broke the LORD’s covenant with them at the town of Adam (6:7a), they were unfaithful to him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>unfaithful:</strong> This word means “to act treacherously” toward someone or “to betray” someone’s trust. It describes someone who does not honor an agreement.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>there they have betrayed me (NJB)</p></blockquote>",

The road led from Samaria, the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel, to Bethel, an important place of worship. The location of the murders was on this road, not within the city of Shechem.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Scholars have different views regarding the significance of this particular location. Some versions (for example, the NCV) include a footnote indicating that the city of Shechem was one of the cities of refuge where people could go to be safe, if they had accidentally killed someone (see Joshua 20.1–9). However, it is not clear how or if that is connected to the murders. Several commentators suggest that Hosea 6:8–9 may be referring to Pekah&apos;s assassination of King Pekahiah spoken of in 2 Kings 15:25. That passage speaks of a group of 50 men from Gilead who participated in the assassination. For more discussion see IVP Bible Background Commentary: 6:8–9, Hubbard (page 129), and Macintosh (page 243). Another possibility is simply that this well-travelled road offered many victims for robbers.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>surely they have committed atrocities:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase is literally “they have done wickedness.” The word “wickedness” is a strong word for sin of various kinds.

This is a passive form.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>It is a Qal perfect form used in a passive sense. Keil (page 102) and McComiskey (page 97).</span></span> In some languages, it may be necessary to use an active verb and make the agent explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>I have appointed a time</u> to reap judgment (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that the NET and GNT both use active verbs. They differ in that the NET keeps the figure of reaping whereas the GNT translates the meaning non-figuratively. Express the meaning clearly and naturally in your language.</p><h4>6:11b–7:1a</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6:11b</sup>when I <u>restore</u> <strong>My people</strong> from captivity.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7:1a</sup>When I <u>heal</u> <strong>Israel</strong>,</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">There are two main ways to interpret the relationship between the clauses in 6:11b and 7:1a:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The clauses are parallel. Both clauses refer to occasions when the LORD desired to bless his people. These clauses are the first part of a sentence that continues in 7:1. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6:11b</sup>When I would restore the fortunes of my people, <sup>7:1a</sup>when I would heal Israel, (NRSV) <em>(CEV, GNT, NAB, NET, NIV, NJPS, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The clauses are not parallel. The first clause refers back to the appointed harvest for Judah in 6:11a. That harvest would happen when the LORD restored the fortunes of his people. <em>With this interpretation, this clause is the final part of the sentence that began with 6:11a. The second clause starts a new sentence. For example:</em></p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6:11a</sup>For you too, Judah, a harvest is in store, <sup>6:11b</sup>when I restore my people’s fortunes. <sup>7:1a</sup>Whenever I would heal Israel, (NJB) <em>(BSB, ESV, KJV, NASB, NCV, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">Interpretation (1) is recommended. It best fits the context of the surrounding verses that focus on the sins of the people. Interpretation (2) makes good sense only if the “harvest” mentioned in 6:11a is understood as the LORD’s blessing. However, here it probably refers to his judgment.</p><h4>6:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>when I restore My people from captivity.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">At the very times</span> when I want to give back to my people their prosperity,</p></li><li><p>I greatly desire to bless my people, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and make them strong and prosperous</span> once more.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>when I restore My people from captivity:</strong> In Hebrew, the phrase <em>when I</em> implies that the LORD desires to do something and that his desire is not fulfilled. The phrase <em>restore My people from captivity</em> is literally “turn back the captivity of my people.” This is a Hebrew idiom. It refers here to the LORD’s desire to restore the prosperity and stability that his people enjoyed in earlier times.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In some contexts, this idiom refers to the return of the LORD’s people from exile. However, that is probably not in focus in this context.

They express the reason that God’s desire to bless and heal Israel is not fulfilled. It is because the sins of the people are clearly seen.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the iniquity…the crimes:</strong> In Hebrew, the word <em>iniquity</em> is a general word for sin and guilt. The word <em>crimes</em> is literally “evils.” It refers to actions that are against God’s will, such as dishonest or immoral behavior. In this context, these parallel words are used for poetic effect. These words draw attention to the people’s disobedience of God’s laws and the harm the people cause.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate these words:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the corruption…the wicked deeds (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the guilt…the wickedness (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>their wickedness…the evil they do (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Ephraim…Samaria:</strong> Ephraim, the main tribe of Israel, is used as a figure of speech to represent the entire nation of Israel. Samaria, the capital of Israel, is also a figure of speech that represents all the people of the nation. Since both names refer to Israel, some versions make only the name “Israel” explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Whenever I want to heal my people <u>Israel</u> and make them prosperous again, all I can see is their wickedness and the evil they do. (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>7:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the iniquity of Ephraim will be exposed,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">that is when</span> the sin/guilt of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the people of</span> Ephraim becomes known</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I cannot do it, because</span> I can clearly see their evil <span data-bnType=\"implied\">way of life</span> throughout Israel</p></li><li><p>the guilt of the people of Israel is obvious,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will be exposed:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>exposed</em> is a form of the same word that describes exposing the lewdness of Gomer in 2:10a. It means to be uncovered or exposed.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a passive clause. In some languages, it may be necessary to use an active verb and to make the agent explicit. Probably the agent here is the sins themselves. Sinful actions show themselves through their own harmful results. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When I would heal Israel,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The <u>guilt</u> of Ephraim <u>reveals itself</u> (NJPS)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to translate this idea using active verbs is to express who sees the sins instead of expressing what agent exposed them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Whenever I want to heal Israel, all <u>I can see</u> is Ephraim’s sin and Samaria’s wickedness. (GW)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 7:1b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to reorder and/or combine the parallel parts. For example, the CEV combines “sins” with “crimes”:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but then I see the <u>crimes</u> in Israel and Samaria. (CEV)</p></blockquote><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:11b–7:1c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to combine and/or reorder some of the parts in these clauses. It may also be more natural to express the relationships between the parts in a different way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Although</u> I long to heal my people and make them prosperous again, <u>I cannot</u>. <u>That is because</u> their sins and evil deeds are so obvious.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I <u>want</u> to restore the prosperity of my people.

Instead they let the context imply the relationship of these verse parts to the previous clauses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>People cheat each other.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Thieves are on the <u>inside</u> and bandits on the <u>outside</u>!

In contrast to the people’s future repentance (6:1–3), he gave examples of their current disloyalty and corruption, including their reliance on other nations instead of him. They continued to commit sins, and they refused to seek him. He announced that he would judge them, and he illustrated his coming judgment in various ways.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In this section, the Hebrew text sometimes uses second person pronouns (“you”) and sometimes third person pronouns (“they” or “he”) to refer to the people of Israel. The BSB follows the Hebrew pronoun usage. It uses “they” in 6:5–10, “you” in 6:4 &amp; 11, and “they” or “he” in 7:1–16. Throughout these verses the LORD is the speaker, and he either addresses the people directly or speaks about them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">English versions all use “you” in 6:11 and “they” in chapter 7, but they differ in the way they use the pronouns in 6:5–10. You should use the most natural and least confusing way in your language to handle the pronouns in 6:5–10. In 6:7–10, the Display will follow the BSB pronoun choice in the first meaning line and give another pronoun choice in the second meaning line. See the note on “you” in 2:16b–c, where the pronoun changes are similar.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples of section headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Transitory Faithfulness and Imminent Judgment (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Impenitence of Israel and Judah (NRSV)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1028006007\" data-endVerseId=\"1028007002\"><h3>Paragraph 6:7–7:2</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, the LORD gave examples of how the people of Israel had failed to know him and had failed to show love to him and others.</p></div><h4>7:2a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse continues the description of the deceitful people.

The preceding context describes people who live deceitfully as if the LORD did not care. But the true situation in 7:2a–b is that God does indeed care.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to indicate this relationship:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use an explicit conjunction, as the BSB does. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and the bandits raid outside. <u>But</u> they do not consider that I remember all their wickedness… (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>marauders raid in the open; <u>and</u> they never pause to consider that I remember all their wicked deeds… (NJB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Do not use an explicit conjunction.

They are not hidden from him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate these words:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I have seen (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I am watching (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>all their evil:</strong> This phrase refers to actions that are against God’s will, such as dishonest or immoral behavior.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all the evil things they’ve done (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all their wickedness (NRSV)</p></blockquote><h4>7:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Now their deeds are all around them; they are before My face.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the truth is that</span> their sins surround them.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>their misdeeds encircle them (REB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Make explicit the implied comparison to enemy soldiers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Their wicked deeds <span data-bnType=\"implied\">are like enemies who</span> have surrounded them.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Now:</strong> This conjunction may indicate a time reference or introduce a contrast.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Its people don’t realize I am watching them. <u>Their</u> sinful deeds are all around them (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Any of these options are acceptable. Use a natural way in your language to indicate one of these relationships.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they are before My face:</strong> This clause is parallel to the clause “I remember all their evil” in 7:2a. The meaning is related. God always sees every evil deed the people do, and he does not forget them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they are right in front of me (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I see them all (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>their own deeds…stare me in the face (NJB)</p></blockquote>",

It burned until the interior of the oven was glowing hot and the fuel had burned down to hot coals or ash. The baker then pressed the dough onto the inside surface of the oven walls or laid it among the coals.

The fire in the oven is so hot that the baker does not need to stir the coals (<em>stoke</em>) to keep it going or to make the oven any hotter. In this simile, the intensity of heat represents the intensity of the people’s desire for evil. Some versions make it explicit that the extreme heat is the reason that the fire does not need to be stirred. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They are like a heated oven, <u>an oven so hot</u> that a baker doesn’t have to fan its flames when he makes bread. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If this simile is not clear in your language, see the General Comment on 7:4b–c for some translation options.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>from the kneading to the rising of the dough:</strong> This phrase describes a period of time during which a baker prepares dough in order to bake bread. The time starts when the baker kneads the bread dough and ends after the dough rises from the effect of yeast. At that point, the bread is ready to place in the oven. Normally a baker needed to stir the fire at that time to make it hot enough to bake the bread. However, this oven is already hot enough, so there is no need for the baker to stir the fire.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The processes of kneading dough and using yeast to make the dough rise may not be known in some cultures. If that is true in your language group, here are some other ways to describe this period of time:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>until the dough is ready to bake (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when he makes bread (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the kneading of the dough:</strong> To knead dough means to fold, press, and stretch the bread dough. This process mixes all the ingredients well and makes the dough smooth.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the rising of the dough:</strong> To make dough rise, a baker adds yeast to the dough. He then places it undisturbed in a warm place for a while. The yeast causes the bread to expand in size in preparation for baking.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 7:4b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">If the simile of the oven is not clear in your language, here are some other translation options:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Make explicit the way in which the people are like an oven.

It is less likely that the plotters would approach and then allow their emotions to smolder all night.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This statement is a simile. In this simile, the hearts of people are compared to an oven. Their strong feelings as they treacherously make evil plans is like the extreme heat of the oven.

It is supported by Stuart (pages 116, 120) and Kidner (page 70). (2) The MT has “their baker.” For example, the NJPS says, “Through the night Their baker has slept.” This text is supported by Andersen and Freedman (page 449), Hubbard (page 135), Keil (page 106), Macintosh (page 263), and McComiskey (page 105). See McComiskey for grammatical reasons in favor of this text. It is recommended that you follow option (1) along with almost all English versions. In option (2) the phrase “their baker” would have to be understood figuratively as part of the oven metaphor. It is difficult to find a figurative meaning that fits logically in the context.</span></span> This clause is a metaphor that continues the simile of the oven in 7:6a. In this metaphor, the people’s <em>anger</em> or passion is compared to the coals in an oven. During the night the coals are allowed to smolder or die down. Similarly, the intensity of the people’s emotion is at a low level during the night. They are waiting for the right time to put their plans into action.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to express this similarity:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>All night long their anger is low (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Their plot smolders through the night (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>all night:</strong> In the metaphor of the smoldering coals, the phrase <em>all night</em> refers to a literal night.

Verse 7:7c describes the murders from the standpoint of the kings who were murdered.</p><h4>7:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>All of them are hot as an oven,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Yes, their anger/emotion is like a hot oven/fire.</p></li><li><p>Due to their strong/hot feelings,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>All of them are hot as an oven:</strong> This statement repeats the simile of the oven from 7:4 and 7:6. The word “hearts” is not made explicit here as it was in 7:6a, but the function of the simile is the same. It compares the people’s angry desire to do harm to the heat of an oven. Their intense emotions lead them to commit the specific acts of murder described in 7:7b–c.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this simile:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Their anger/emotion is like a hot oven.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In the heat of their anger (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>All of them:</strong> This phrase may refer specifically to the people who are involved in the plot to murder the leaders of Israel. It may also refer more generally to the people of Israel. If possible, translate this phrase so that it can refer to either group.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>All:</strong> This word refers here to the group as a whole, not necessarily to every individual in the group. Notice that the GNT (quoted above) does not make the word <em>All</em> explicit. You should use a natural way in your language to emphasize that the whole group was burning with anger.</p><h4>7:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and they devour their rulers.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like a fire that destroys what it burns</span>, they destroy their rulers.</p></li><li><p>they murder their leaders.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they devour their rulers:</strong> In Hebrew, the word <em>devour</em> often refers literally to eating food. It also refers figuratively to a fire that “consumes” what it burns or a sword that “devours” those that it kills (see Leviticus 6:10, 10:2; Deuteronomy 32:42). In this context, it probably continues the figurative idea of the blazing flames and hot oven. A fire destroys what it burns or consumes. Similarly, the people referred to in 7:7a destroy or kill their rulers.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDB (#398, sense 1a4) and HALOT (#473, sense 3) give the word the figurative sense of “destroy” in this context. Andersen and Freedman (pages 460–461) understand a connection to the imagery of the oven. Stuart (page 120) says that 7:7 marks the climax of the oven simile.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate this figure of speech:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They consume their judges [like a fire]. (GW)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without using a figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they murdered their rulers (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>their rulers:</strong> In Hebrew, the word <em>rulers</em> is literally judges. It can refer to any leader who governs or rules a group of people and is responsible for carrying out justice.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDB (#8199, sense 1a), TWOT (#2443).</span></span> In this context, the phrase <em>their rulers</em> is a poetic parallel with their kings. It probably describes the same leaders.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Andersen and Freedman (page 460), Keil (page 106), McComiskey (page 106), and Stuart (page 120) all identify the “judges” in 7:7b with the “kings” in 7:7c. Hubbard (pages 135–136) acknowledges that “judges (rulers) is an appropriate term to describe the kings whose responsibility was to enforce justice.” But he says that the word more likely refers here to the “princes” or “courtiers” who were responsible to carry out the king’s orders.</span></span></p><h4>7:7c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:7c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>All their kings fall;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The kings <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Israel</span> fall/die <span data-bnType=\"implied\">one after another</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yes,</span> they assassinate king after king.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>All their kings fall:</strong> This expression is similar in meaning to the previous clause. It means that the kings of Israel are murdered.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Keil (page 106) and McComiskey (page 106).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>All:</strong> In this context the word <em>All</em> is a figure of speech (hyperbole). This figure of speech emphasizes that people kill many of the kings. It does not refer literally to every king of Israel.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>It probably refers to the kings of Israel who were assassinated following the death of Jeroboam II. Four of the six kings during that period were assassinated. McComiskey (page 106).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, a literal translation of this hyperbole may not be understood correctly.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate it:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Their kings have been assassinated one after another (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They kill their kings one after another (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So many of their kings have died!</p></blockquote><h4>7:7d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:7d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>not one of them calls upon Me.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And <span data-bnType=\"implied\">even in this terrible situation,</span> no one calls to me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for help</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yet/But</span> no one prays to me.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and:</strong> The phrase “none of them” contrasts with the phrases “all of them” in 7:7a and “All their kings” in 7:7c. Verse 7:7d also gives the unexpected result of the series of murders described in 7:7b–c.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to McComiskey, verse 7:7d expresses Hosea’s amazement that no one recognized the seriousness of their situation and asked God to deliver them (page 106). This line also expresses the LORD’s bitter disappointment that no one turned to him (Stuart, page 120).</span></span> Hebrew the BSB and some other versions do not use a conjunction here. Some other versions use the word <em>and</em> or “but.” Use a natural way in your language to indicate that 7:7d is an unexpected result.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not one of them:</strong> This phrase may refer in a general way to none of the people of Israel. It may also refer specifically to none of the kings or government officials. If possible, translate this phrase so that it can refer to either group.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>calls upon Me:</strong> This phrase means to pray to God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate 7:7d:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but no one prays to me for help (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and no one cries out to me for help (NLT)</p></blockquote>",

Specifically, <em>calling out</em> to Egypt and <em>turning</em> to Assyria probably indicate that Israel requested alliances with those wealthy and powerful countries. These alliances would ensure military and other assistance.</p>",

(NET) <em>(BSB, NET, NIV, NJPS, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The word means “according to.” With this meaning, verse 7:12d indicates that the LORD will discipline the Israelites. He will do this in a way that accords with a report that is made to an assembly of people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will discipline them <u>according to</u> the report made to their congregation. (ESV) <em>(ESV, KJV, NASB, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This interpretation continues the figurative description of the LORD as a trapper who catches birds in a net.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I will chastise them:</strong> In Hebrew, the word <em>chastise</em> is literally “chasten.” This word can refer to moral instruction, rebuke, or punishment. The purpose is to correct wrong behavior. In this context, it indicates that the LORD will discipline or punish the people of Israel.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NIDOTTE (#3579) and Davies (page 140).</span></span> He will probably do this by allowing Assyria to capture them and take them into exile.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>McComiskey (page 112) and Keil (page 109).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate 7:12d:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use one or more metaphors that continue the figurative language of 7:12b–c.

It describes the time when a trapper hears the noise of birds that have gathered together in a flock.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause refers to the time when the LORD hears news about a group of people who have gathered together. This gathering may refer to Israel’s leaders who meet with representatives of Egypt and/or Assyria to seek aid from them.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Wood (page 199) and Macintosh (page 276).</span></span></p>",

Ruin to them, they have sinned against me!

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they speak lies against me (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they tell lies about me (REB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>“to me.” The clause means that the people are insincere when they pray.

However, according to Hubbard (page 141), the preposition can indicate separation. Keil (page 110) also prefers the MT. According to him, the verb with this preposition implies “depart and turn against God.” “McComiskey (page 115) agrees that the preposition may add a sense of hostility to the people&apos;s departure from God.”</span></span></p>",

A similar negative name, <em>loʾ</em> <em>ʿel</em>, which means “a not-god, something that is not a god,” occurs in Deuteronomy 32:21. These factors have led to three main interpretations: (1) They turn to a non-God (or “False Most High”); (2) They do not turn to the Most High; and (3) They turn/return but not upward. These interpretations have been presented as translation options in the Notes, because they all represent slightly different aspects of the same situation.

It compares the people of Israel to a bow that is used to shoot arrows at enemy soldiers. The similarity between the people and a bow depends on the meaning of the Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>faulty bow</em>. This phrase is more literally “deceitful/treacherous bow” or “slack bow.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Scholars do not agree on the derivation of this Hebrew word. It may be derived from one root with two meanings (HALOT, #8840) or from two homonyms (TWOT, #2169a).</span></span> There are two main ways to interpret this phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The word <em>faulty</em> comes from a Hebrew word that means “deceitful” or “treacherous.” It refers to a bow that is unreliable, perhaps because it is warped. It cannot be trusted to shoot an arrow accurately and hit the target.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Macintosh (pages 285–286), McComiskey (page 116), Wood (page 199).</span></span> The simile indicates that the people were untrustworthy and deceitful. God could not rely on them to worship him sincerely and do what he wanted. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they are like an unreliable bow (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They are like a defective bow. (GW) <em>(BSB, ESV, GNT, KJV, NAB, NASB, NET, NIV, NJB, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The word <em>faulty</em> comes from a Hebrew word that means “slack.” It refers to a bow that has a loose bowstring. It is weak or useless, because the arrows do not reach their target. The simile indicates that the people were weak and helpless as a nation.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Stuart (page 124).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They are like a loose bow that can’t shoot. (NCV) <em>(NCV, NJPS, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The Display will follow interpretation (1), but both interpretations are appropriate similes for the people of Israel.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the BSB, NET, and GW, the way in which the bow is “deceitful” is left implied. Some versions are more specific. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They are as <u>unreliable</u> as a <u>crooked</u> bow. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions allow or combine aspects of both interpretations. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They are as <u>useless</u> as a <u>crooked</u> bow. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you can translate in a similar way, it will be very acceptable.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If a term for <em>bow</em> is not known in your language area, you may use a general term.

This clause is similar to the cultural gesture “Blow the ram’s horn” in 5:8. In both contexts, the purpose of blowing the horn is to warn the people of danger.

In Hebrew, it is a simile: “<u>like</u> the eagle over the house of the LORD.” Both figures of speech compare the implied topic (an enemy) to an eagle that flies or circles over the house of the LORD. An enemy army and an eagle are similar, because both are large, strong, and swift. An army and an eagle also attack their opponents or prey.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate these figures of speech:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a metaphor. Make the similarity explicit if it will be helpful. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now an eagle is swooping down to attack my land. (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a simile.

English versions interpret this word in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The word refers here to <u>an eagle</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Like an eagle (NASB) <em>(BSB, CEV, GNT, GW, KJV, NASB, NET, NIV, NJB, NJPS, NLT, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The word refers here to <u>a vulture</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>One like a vulture (ESV) <em>(ESV, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions and commentaries. Eagles attack and eat live animals. Most vultures eat only dead animals.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If eagles are not known in your area, here are two ways to translate the word:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a descriptive phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a large fierce bird</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Substitute another large bird that attacks and eats smaller birds or animals.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>over the house of the LORD:</strong> This phrase indicates that the eagle is ready to attack or has already started to attack the house of the LORD. There are two main ways to interpret the meaning of the phrase <em>the house of the LORD</em> in this context:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to <u>the nation of Israel</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Enemies are swooping down on my land like eagles!

Biblical Hebrew Reference Grammar, GLOSSARY, SPLIT PHRASE).</span></span> It is clear from the preceding and following verses that the words “they” and <em>Israel</em> both refer to the people of Israel.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The verb <em>cries out</em> means “cry out or call for help in time of distress.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT (#570a) points out that the verb form used here almost always refers to a call for help.</span></span> Some versions make explicit that the people are asking for help. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Now Israel pleads with me, ‘Help us…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>O our God:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase is literally “My God.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some scholars emend this word to make it “God of” and link it to the word “Israel” at the end of the sentence. This yields: “God of Israel.” Stuart (page 131), McComiskey (pages 120–121), and Andersen and Freedman (page 490). This is one way to resolve the apparent conflict in the Hebrew grammar between the plural “they” in “they cry out” followed by the singular “my” in “my God.” (We would expect their cry to be, “our God”). However, there are alternative ways to explain the discrepancy that do not require emending the text (see note).</span></span> The BSB adds the vocative <em>O</em> to introduce this phrase.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The singular “my” in Hebrew may indicate that each person says these words.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Keil (page 112), and Macintosh (page 294).</span></span> Versions such as the BSB above may have used <em>our</em> because it sounds more natural in English to say <em>our God</em> when a group of people cries out.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>My God (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Our God (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You<sup>(sing)</sup> who are our<sup>(excl)</sup> God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a phrase that is natural in your language when a group of people calls out to God.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>God:</strong> In Hebrew, this word is <em>ʾelohim</em>, not Yahweh.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“O Samaria, he has rejected your calf idol. (NET) <em>(BSB, ESV, GNT, NASB, NCV, NET, NJB, NLT, REB, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The LXX has “<u>Reject your calf Samaria</u>.” This is a command that the people of Samaria should reject their calf idol.

It probably introduces the reason for the LORD’s anger.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Macintosh (page 307) suggests that it has an emphatic meaning such as “indeed,” but the NIV is only version that may possibly convey this particular emphasis.</span></span> Some versions do not have an explicit word to introduce the reason.

Therefore, it cannot be God. Try to give the same emphasis in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This thing—it was made by a human workman!

It has lost its value as an independent nation. There are three ways to interpret this statement:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It describes the worthless status of Israel when its people no longer live in their land.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and now the nations consider you worthless (CEV) <em>(CEV, GNT, NAB, NJPS)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This interpretation is similar to 7:8, which says that Israel mixes with the nations and is like a worthless cake of bread. It is also an accurate description of Israel’s history.

They then went a long ways to the east following the Euphrates River. The words <em>have gone up</em> do not refer here to going uphill or to going straight north. It is suggested that you translate these words in a more general way, as in the preceding notes on the word “for.” The emphasis here is not on the exact direction of travel.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>like a wild donkey:</strong> A <em>wild donkey</em> or “wild ass” is an untamed animal that is similar to a small horse.

Dearman (pages 128–129) agrees that wild donkeys lived “in herds as a sociable animal.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In languages that do not have a term for “ass” or <em>donkey</em>, here are some ways to translate the term:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use the name of a similar animal in your culture.

In spite of what Israel expected, God will still gather them to be punished.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>When the first of two clauses is introduced by “although,” the relationship between the clauses is sometimes known as concessive (contrary to expectation).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10a</sup>Though they hire allies among the nations, <sup>10b</sup>I will soon gather them up.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the king and princes (ESV) <em>(ESV, NAB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions and commentaries.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>will begin to diminish:</strong> The issues in this part of the clause involve textual differences between the Hebrew (MT) and Greek (LXX) texts. They also involve textual and interpretation differences in the words used in the MT. Here is a summary of the main issues:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>One combination of words in the MT means “<u>will begin</u>” + “<u>to diminish</u>” <u>or</u> “<u>to be few</u>.” It refers to a future decrease in numbers or strength.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This textual/interpretation option is supported by Macintosh, Delitzsch, and Wood. The BART interlinear glosses this phrase as “will begin [to be] few/less.” NIDOTTE (#2725) says that the Hiphil form of the root <em>ḥalal</em> is frequently used as “to begin.” It does not mention Hosea 8:10 specifically. McComiskey (page 127) translates this phrase as “they will begin in a little while [to suffer].” See TWOT (#1228a) for more information on the Hebrew adjective <em>maʿaṭ</em> that it glosses as “Little, few, small.” It does not mention this verse specifically.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and they will begin to diminish (BSB, NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They will become weaker and weaker (NCV) <em>(BSB, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, NJPS)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Another combination of words in the MT means “<u>will writhe/suffer</u>” + “<u>soon</u>” <u>or</u> “<u>a short while</u>.” It refers to future pain and suffering.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Lexham Discourse Hebrew Bible (interlinear) in Logos glosses this phrase as “will writhe soon.” There is no consensus regarding the word that many versions translate as “writhe.” It may come from changing the vowels in the Hiphil form of <em>ḥalal</em>. TWOT (#623) has a verb <em>ḥul</em> that can mean “be in anguish” and a noun (#623b) <em>ḥil</em> that can mean “pain.” In combination with one of these words, the adjective <em>maʿaṭ</em> is given the sense “soon,” perhaps from the idea of “a little while.” For further discussion, see McComiskey (page 130). Commentaries that support this textual/interpretation option include: Dearman, Hubbard, Stuart, and Andersen and Freedman.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They shall soon writhe (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They will suffer for a while (GW) <em>(CEV, ESV, GNT, GW, KJV, NABRE, NJB, NLT, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The LXX has “<u>they will cease</u>” + “<u>a little</u>” + “<u>from anointing</u>.” It refers to a future period of time when the people will no longer appoint their leaders.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Davies (page 206) for discussion of possible derivations of “cease” and “anointing” in the LXX. McComiskey (page 130) has a similar discussion</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And they shall cease for a little while from anointing (RSV) <em>(REB, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The Display will follow textual/interpretation option (1) along with many versions and commentaries. This option requires no change in the vowels or consonants of the MT. It also allows for the normal meaning of the second word (“few”).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, you may also follow option (2). This option is supported by a majority of versions and commentaries. Whichever option you choose, it is suggested that you put the other option in a footnote.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>under the oppression of the king of princes:</strong> In Hebrew, the phrase <em>under the oppression</em> is literally “from the burden.” Here the word “burden” refers figuratively to various kinds of suffering and hardship that the people will experience in Assyria.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>of the king of princes:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase is literally “king princes.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The phrase “king princes” is not used anywhere else in the OT.</span></span> (For the word <em>princes</em>, see the note on 8:4b.) There are three main ways to interpret this phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “<u>king of princes</u>.” This expression indicates the greatest king. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>the great king</u> (NLT) <em>(BSB, GNT, NET, NCV, NIV, NJB, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “<u>kings and princes</u>.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>kings and rulers</u> (CEV) <em>(CEV, GW, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “<u>king and princes</u>.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>king</u> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and</span> <u>officers</u> (NJPS) <em>(NABRE, NJPS, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with a majority of versions and commentaries.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Macintosh, Keil, Wood, McComiskey, and Hubbard suggest that this is a construct phrase, “king of princes,” similar to the expression “king of kings.” Here it refers to the king of Assyria. See Macintosh for a helpful description of the historical context. Andersen and Freedman, Davies, and Stuart prefer the view that this is a coordinate phrase, “king and/or princes,” in spite of the absence of a conjunction in the MT. The Hebrew word for “king” is singular, so the plural “kings” in the NRSV and similar versions is evidently not based on exegetical or grammatical reasons.</span></span> This interpretation best fits the historical context in which the people of Israel were deported to Assyria.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions make explicit that this phrase refers to the king of Assyria. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the great king of Assyria (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the emperor of Assyria (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In many languages, it will be helpful to make this information explicit.</p>",

The reason is that they were unfaithful to God and will soon experience the consequences of their unfaithfulness. God will send them into exile.</p><h4>9:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for you have played the harlot against your God;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Because you<sup>(sing)</sup> have left your God to sell yourself to other lovers.</p></li><li><p>You<sup>(plur)</sup> have been <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> a prostitute! <span data-bnType=\"implied\">You have turned away</span> from your God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for you have played the harlot against your God:</strong> The nation of Israel is compared to a harlot/prostitute, because the people were not faithful to God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate this metaphor:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For you have played the harlot, forsaking your God. (NASB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Change the metaphor to a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You have been like a prostitute against your God. (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning directly without using a figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For you have been unfaithful to your God; (NIV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">The Hebrew phrase “from beside your God” indicates that the people’s unfaithful behavior distanced them from God. Some versions make this information explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You have <u>turned away</u> from your God and have been unfaithful to him. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for you have <u>deserted</u> your God to play the whore (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your God:</strong> In some languages, the phrase <em>your God</em> may imply that Israel’s God is not the same as Hosea’s God. One way to avoid this wrong meaning is to translate the phrase as “our<sup>(incl)</sup> God.”</p><h4>9:1d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:1d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>you have made love for hire on every threshing floor.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You<sup>(sing)</sup> loved the wages <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you earned as</span> a prostitute <span data-bnType=\"implied\">there</span> on every threshing floor.</p></li><li><p>In the places where people thresh grain, you<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">gladly</span> offer your body to others for the money they will give you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you have made love for hire on every threshing floor:</strong> This line again compares the Israelites to a harlot/prostitute. A prostitute earns wages by hiring herself to make love. Likewise, Israel gave herself to Baal and other false gods by worshiping them. The people wrongly thought that those false gods provided their grain and other needs as wages for their worship. See also Hosea 2:5, 2:8.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this line:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You have loved the wages you made as a prostitute there on every threshing floor.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Everywhere that people thresh grain, you are like prostitutes who are delighted with the fee you receive for selling yourself to others.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>love for hire:</strong> This phrase refers to the fee that a client pays to a prostitute. In this context, the wages are the grain on the threshing floor.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>on every threshing floor:</strong> Threshing floors were large open areas where the farmers removed the kernels of grain from the husk. Some scholars believe that threshing floors were also areas where the people worshiped Baal or other idols.</p>",

They represent the products, grain and wine, that are produced at the <em>threshing floor</em> and <em>winepress</em>. It means that there will not be enough grain for the people to eat or enough wine for them to drink. In some languages, it may be more natural to translate the meaning directly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>There won&apos;t be enough grain to feed people. There won&apos;t be enough wine to go around.

If <em>new wine</em> is not familiar in your language area, you may use a more general term. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>there will be no wine (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>them:</strong> There is a textual difference here that involves the word <em>them</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The LXX and other ancient versions have <em>them</em>. <em>them</em> refers to the people of Israel.

As a result, there are two main interpretations:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The subject is <u>sacrifices</u>. 9:4a–b says that the people will not offer sacrifices to the LORD. This clause continues to describe those sacrifices.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Davies (page 217), Wood (page 204).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Such sacrifices shall be like mourners’ bread (NRSV) <em>(BSB, CEV, ESV, GW, NCV, NET, NIV, NJB, NLT, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The subject is <u>bread</u> or food.

The mourners’ bread is the nearest preceding noun. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Their sacrifices will be like <u>the food that mourners eat</u>.

With this interpretation, the line continues the description of the bread of mourners.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>defiled:</strong> This word refers to spiritual uncleanness. Old Testament laws described activities and objects that were ritually unclean. Therefore they were not acceptable for worship of the LORD.

BART identifies <em>ki</em> as a deictic marker that gives emphasis. This interpretation is also preferred by Hubbard (page 158). No versions follow this approach. The NJPS introduces the clause with the word “but,” indicating a contrast. It is the only version that follows this approach.</span></span> The reason that this food is considered to be unclean is that it is only for themselves. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>for</u> their food will be for themselves alone (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, in many languages, this clause does not give a logical reason for the preceding statement.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Andersen &amp; Freedman (page 527) say that it does not provide a recognizable reason for either what precedes or follows.</span></span> Many versions leave the relationship between the clauses implied.

The LORD regards this food to be unclean and those that eat it to be unclean. It will be food for those that eat it, but it is not fit to use for worship.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this line:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>this food will be for themselves alone</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>this food will serve only to satisfy their appetite</p></blockquote><h4>9:4f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:4f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>it will not enter the house of the LORD.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Such food will not be allowed in the temple of Yahweh.</p></li><li><p>but not for the worship of Yahweh.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it will not enter the house of the LORD:</strong> This clause means that the LORD does not want this food to be offered to him in the temple.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>it will not enter:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase is literally “it will not go.” This phrase is probably a prohibition. The LORD will not allow unclean bread in his house. It is not just a statement that it will not happen.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Davies (218) describes this statement as a “prohibition.” Stuart (page 144) says the bread is “ritually excluded.”</span></span> Some versions make it explicit that this is a prohibition.

Some versions use past tense. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What a scene of devastation they have left!

The meaning lines in the Display will do the same.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This verse part means that when their enemy destroys their cities and land, the people of Israel who are still alive will try to escape.

It is because Israel will be destroyed, and the people who escape the destruction will never live there again. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>For</u> even if they escape destruction (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The word “look” draws attention to the statement that follows it.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>McComiskey (page 141) identifies the functions of both Hebrew words.</span></span> Some versions translate the word literally here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>Look</u>!

He says that “the people will be taken captive; they will be gathered by Egypt…and buried by Memphis.” According to footnote (c) in the NET, the verb has the implication “grab hold” in this context. It “pictures a personified Egypt taking the fugitives prisoner.”</span></span> Whichever interpretation you follow, it is suggested that you put the other interpretation in a footnote.</p><h4>9:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and Memphis will bury them.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the city of</span> Memphis will bury them.</p></li><li><p>They will be buried in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the graveyards of</span> Memphis!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and Memphis will bury them:</strong> Memphis was an important city in the country of Egypt.

When that happens, the people will no longer be able to celebrate at harvest time or enjoy the crops from their land. The section describes aspects of daily life that the people in Israel would clearly understand. Some examples are harvest festivals (9:1, 5), threshing grain and making wine (9:2), unclean food (9:3–4), offerings and sacrifices (9:4), briers and thorns (9:6), and prophets (9:7–8).

Andersen and Freedman (page 534) says: “Since animosity is parallel to iniquity in 7b, and parallel to the trap in 8b, the word is probably intended to describe hostility against the prophet.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>prophet:</strong> Here the <em>prophet</em> is probably Hosea.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The phrase “my God” in this clause suggests that Hosea is referring to himself here.

The meaning of the simile is affected by the meaning of the Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>Tyre</em>. There are two main interpretations:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Hebrew word means the city of Tyre. The simile compares Ephraim to the prosperous Phoenician city of Tyre, located on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>McComiskey (page 152), Wood (page 206), and Keil (page 126).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have seen Israel, like Tyre, given a pleasant place. (NCV) <em>(BSB, GW, KJV, NASB, NCV, NIV, NJB, NJPS, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Hebrew word means “palm tree.” The simile compares Ephraim to a palm tree.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This meaning is based on an Arabic word with the same consonants. Macintosh (page 372).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Once I saw Ephraim as a young palm planted in a lovely meadow. (NRSV) <em>(CEV, ESV, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This Hebrew word does not mean “palm tree” anywhere else in the Old Testament.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Ephraim:</strong> In this verse, as elsewhere in Hosea, the name <em>Ephraim</em> refers to the nation of Israel. Some versions make Israel explicit here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>If have seen Israel, like Tyre, given a pleasant place. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>planted in a meadow:</strong> This phrase is literally “planted in pastureland.” The word for “pastureland” describes a green meadow that has plenty of water. It is an ideal place for plants to grow.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Macintosh (pages 371–372).</span></span> Here the phrase is used figuratively. It is a metaphor that compares the people of Tyre and Israel to a crop or a garden that is planted in good pastureland. The land provided the people who lived there with opportunities to grow strong and prosperous.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Wood (page 206), Keil (page 126), and Macintosh (page 372).</span></span></p><h4>9:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But Ephraim will bring out his children for slaughter.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">now</span> Ephraim will/must take/bring out his children to be killed.”</p></li><li><p>Yet <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will experience disaster.</span> You will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">be forced to</span> take your <span data-bnType=\"implied\">own</span> children to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a place where</span> someone will kill them.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But Ephraim will bring out his children for slaughter:</strong> In Hebrew, this verse part is more literally “and Ephraim to bring out to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">one who</span> kills his sons/children.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BART interlinear.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause indicates that the children of the people of Israel will be murdered. There are various opinions as to the historical event(s) to which this clause refers. It could refer specifically to the time when the Assyrian army will attack Israel and kill children or it could refer to others who will kill them.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>McComiskey (page 152) suggests that this statement is metonymy for the Assyrians. Wood (page 206) suggests that this statement connotes frequent murders, civil strife, and also warfare.</span></span> If possible, translate this statement in a general way that does not indicate who will kill the children.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>But:</strong> This statement describes a horrible situation that contrasts strongly with the good situation described in 9:13a. Many English versions introduce the contrast with a word such as <em>But</em>. Indicate this contrast in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>will bring out:</strong> In Hebrew, the form of this verb may indicate that the people were forced to bring their children somewhere to be killed.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to Macintosh (page 371), the infinitive construct with lamed expresses obligation, compulsion. He refers to Gesenius’ Hebrew Grammar, 114 The Infinitive Construct, Remark 2. Lange (page76) says that this construction = “must lead forth.” Versions that explicitly indicate compulsion include ESV, NJPS, NRSV, and REB. Versions that do not specify compulsion but simply indicate what the people will do include CBSB, EV, GW, KJV, NAB, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, NLT. McComiskey (page 150) uses the wording “will lead out,” but does not comment further.</span></span> Some versions indicate this explicitly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>must lead out (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>must bring out (NJPS)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Other versions indicate that the people <u>will</u> bring out their children to be killed. They do not indicate that they are forced to do so.

Because of their sin and betrayal, it is necessary for the LORD to judge them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples of section headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Israel’s Sin and Its Consequences (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Sin’s Terrible Results (CEV)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1028009014\" data-endVerseId=\"1028009014\"><h3>Paragraph 9:14</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">This paragraph gives Hosea’s prayer.</p></div><h4>9:14</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Give them, O LORD—what will You give? Give them wombs that miscarry and breasts that dry up!:</strong> This verse is a prayer of Hosea. There are two main ways to interpret the intent of the prayer:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>This is a prayer directed against the people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The technical name for such a prayer is “imprecatory.” To imprecate means to invoke evil or to curse something. See Merriam-Webster “Imprecate.”</span></span> Hosea asks the LORD to fulfill the punishment of 9:13b in this way.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Stuart (page 153), Andersen and Freedman (page 544), Keil (page 126), and Wood (page 207).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Lord, give them what they deserve. Make the women miscarry, or else make them unable to nurse their babies. (GW) <em>(GNT, GW, NCV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>This is a prayer on behalf of the people. Hosea asks the LORD to make the punishment of 9:13b less severe in this way. If fewer children are born, then fewer children will be slaughtered later. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>O Lord, what should I request for your people? I will ask for wombs that don&apos;t give birth and breasts that give no milk. (NLT) <em>(CEV, NLT)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Both these versions use the phrase, “for your people.” This implies that the prayer is for something positive rather than negative. However, neither version makes explicit what is positive about the request.</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">In many versions, the intent of this prayer is left implied. In those versions, either of the interpretations above could apply. In some languages, it may be preferable to make the intent of the prayer explicit. If that is true in your language, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). There are at least two reasons:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>This verse matches the pattern used elsewhere in the OT of a rhetorical question followed by a curse.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Davies (page 229).</span></span></p></li><li><p>Hosea 9:16 has similar expressions, and that verse is clearly directed against the people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Andersen and Freedman (page 544) states that Hosea “is urging YHWH to proceed with the extreme penalties, endorsing what YHWH says in verses 12 and 16 about murdering the children.”</span></span></p></li></ol><h4>9:14a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:14a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Give them, O LORD—what will You give?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ “O Yahweh, give them what is fitting. What will you<sup>(sing)</sup> give them?</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Then Hosea said,</span> “O Yahweh, what will you do to these people?</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Give them, O LORD—what will You give?:</strong> Here the sentence that begins with the request, <em>Give them</em> is interrupted by a rhetorical question. The object of the phrase, <em>Give them</em> is not stated until the phrase is repeated in 9:14b. This interrupted sentence structure is a poetic literary device. The purpose of the device may be to create suspense.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Hubbard (page 166).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, this poetic structure may be confusing and unnatural.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If that is true in your language, here are some other ways to translate this verse part:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Supply an object of <em>Give them</em> that describes the curse in 14b in a general way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Lord, give them what they should have. What will you give them? (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Do not include the first phrase, <em>Give them</em>. Instead, start the sentence with the rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What shall I ask you to do to these people? (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>what will You give?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. This is not a request for information. Its function is probably to state, “I know what you should give.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Andersen and Freedman (page 544).</span></span> Some versions express this as a statement instead of a question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Our Lord, do just one thing for your people— (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>9:14b–c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:14b–c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Give them wombs that miscarry and breasts that dry up!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Give them stillborn babies and breasts without milk!”</p></li><li><p>Prevent them from giving birth to children who are alive, and take away their ability to nurse/breastfeed their babies!”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>14b</sup>Give them <u>wombs</u> <strong>that miscarry</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>14c</sup>and <u>breasts</u> <strong>that dry up</strong>!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Together these lines are a curse.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Stuart (page 153) and Davies (page 229).</span></span> They are the opposite of a traditional blessing for many healthy, nursing children (see Genesis 49:25).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Macintosh (page 374) and Dearman (pages 254–255).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Give them:</strong> The pronoun <em>them</em> is masculine here. It indicates that the curse is against the men and women of the nation, not the women only.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Andersen and Freedman (page 544).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">There is an ellipsis of the words <em>Give them</em> in 9:14c. In some languages, this phrase may need to be supplied from 9:14b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Give them wombs that miscarry and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">give them</span> breasts that are dry.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>wombs that miscarry:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the form of the Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>miscarry</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The phrase means <em>wombs that miscarry</em>. It refers to women whose babies die in the womb. The babies are born dead. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Make the women miscarry (GW) <em>(BSB, ESV, GW, KJV, NASB, NET, NIV, NJB, NJPS, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The phrase means “womb that is barren.” It refers to a woman who is unable to have children. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Make their women barren! (GNT) <em>(CEV, GNT, NAB, NCV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions and all lexicons.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT, NIDOTTE, HALOT, and BDB all identify the Hiphil participle used here as indicating miscarriage. They all mention Hosea 9:14 specifically. McComiskey, Andersen and Freedman, and Macintosh favor miscarriage. Dearman, Stuart, Pusey, and Keil favor barrenness.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>breasts that dry up!:</strong> This phrase indicates that women have no breast milk to nurse a child.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural to speak of wombs and breasts in other ways. For example, it may be more natural to refer specifically to women or to refer only to the functions of giving birth and nursing. Here are some other ways to translate this verse part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Make the wombs of their women miscarry and make their breasts dry.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>make their children die before they are born and make them unable to nurse their babies.</p></blockquote>",

That is where their wickedness began and/or that is where the LORD began to hate them.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Lord’s hatred of evildoers was not limited to one place and time. For that reason, this interpretation understands Gilgal to be the starting place of the people’s evil and of the Lord’s hatred of the evildoers. Versions indicate this by supplying the word “began.” This word is not in the Hebrew. See McComiskey (page 155), Macintosh (page 375), and Keil (page 127).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Every evil of theirs is in Gilgal; there I began to hate them.

The city of Gilgal was well known as a place where people worshiped idols, but it was not the only center for idol worship.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Gilgal:</strong> The city of Gilgal was a major center of idol worship among the Israelites.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Wood (page 207), Kidner (page 90), McComiskey (page 154), and Stuart (page 153).</span></span> See the note for 4:15b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I hated them:</strong> This phrase means that the LORD opposed, detested, and rejected them. Hate separates people and keeps them distant.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT (#2272).</span></span> Here the hatred is intense. The word indicates that the LORD broke off his relationship with the people of Israel.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Dearman (pages 255–257), Kidner (page 90), Andersen and Freedman (page 545), and McComiskey (page 154).</span></span></p><h4>9:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I will drive them from My house for the wickedness of their deeds.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Because of the sinful things that they have done, I will expel them from my household/family.</p></li><li><p>On account of their sinful/wicked behavior, I will disown them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will drive them from My house for the wickedness of their deeds:</strong> This line probably refers to the people of the entire nation of Israel. The people of Israel are very wicked like those in Gilgal. As a consequence, the LORD will drive them out of his house.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I will drive them from My house:</strong> This clause probably means that the LORD will expel the people from his family. They will no longer enjoy the LORD’s blessings that he provided as part of his covenant relationship with them.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>McComiskey (page 155), Keil (page 127), Kidner (page 90), and Wood (page 207).</span></span> This clause is similar to the statement “you are not my people, and I am not your God” in Hosea 1:9.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">One aspect of this broken relationship will be physical separation. The LORD will expel the people from the land of Israel (The GNT has: “out of my land.”). However, this translation unnecessarily limits the intended meaning. The land is only one privilege of the covenant that they will lose.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Most versions use the literal word <em>house</em> to translate this clause. But in Hosea, the LORD’s <em>house</em> usually refers to the temple. It is recommended that you use a different word or phrase here to avoid this wrong meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will expel them from my household/family.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will disown them.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>wickedness of their deeds:</strong> Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>evil (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>evil actions (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wickedness of their deeds (NRSV)</p></blockquote><h4>9:15c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:15c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I will no longer love them; all their leaders are rebellious.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I will not love them any more.

This statement is very similar to “I will no longer have compassion on the house of Israel” in 1:6.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Hosea 1:6 uses a different Hebrew word for love than in Hosea 9:15. However, there is no clear meaning difference between the clauses in each verse.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>all their leaders are rebellious:</strong> The leaders of Israel repeatedly refused to follow the demands of the LORD.

However, it makes better sense to translate it as a description of a prosperous time in Israel’s past.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>10:1b–c uses verb forms that normally indicate completed events.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to translate this metaphor is to change it to a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The people of Israel are like vines that used to produce fruit. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>luxuriant:</strong> In this verse, the word refers to a healthy plant that is growing well.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Hebrew word has two homonyms. One homonym occurs only in Hosea 10:1. It means “luxuriant.” See TWOT (#272), BDB (#1238), and HALOT (electronic ed., page 150–151). Another homonym means “empty.” See TWOT (#273). Versions that correspond to this meaning include the NJPS “Israel is a ravaged vine,” GW “used to produce fruit,” and KJV “empty vine.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>yielding fruit:</strong> The precise meaning of the Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>yielding</em> is debated.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT (electronic ed., page 1437) indicates that there is textual uncertainty concerning this word. For the meaning in this verse, HALOT cites ancient translations with the meaning “to produce/make.” This contrasts with the meaning “to ripen,” which some modern scholars suggest. For example, the Vulgate and Peshitta have: “which brought forth fruit.” However, Rudolf suggests: “that makes fruit ripen over and over again.”</span></span> Here the meaning is probably “to produce” or “to make.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Most modern versions follow the meaning “to produce/make” as in the ancient versions. See the Vulgate and Peshitta example in the previous footnote. HALOT (electronic ed., page 1437) also cites Gesenius-Buhl as supporting the verb <em>shawah</em> II “to make, produce.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use words that focus on producing or making fruit.

These lines (1b–c) imply that the LORD made Israel prosperous, yet Israel gave credit for their prosperity to idols.

One function of this word is to indicate emphasis. For more details on this use of <em>ki</em>, see Van der Merwe, A Biblical Hebrew Reference Grammar, chapter 6. §40.9.2.5.

The BSB and other versions make the emphasis explicit.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some other versions translate the Hebrew word <em>ki</em> as “for” here, which introduces cause. This translation is not recommended here. Although <em>ki</em> can introduce cause in other contexts, it is unlikely that the words the people are about to speak could be the cause of the previous destruction.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Truly</u>, now they say (NJPS)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Surely</u> now they will say (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>now they will say:</strong> Here Hosea describes the future response of the people after the altars are destroyed and their king has been captured.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Wood (page 208).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>These people will soon be saying (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So they’ll say (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>We have no king:</strong> This statement is a direct quote of what the people say. The direct quote continues to the end of the verse.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This statement indicates that the people of Israel no longer have a king. It probably refers to the capture of Hoshea, the last king of Israel, by the Assyrians.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See McComiskey (page 161) and Stuart (pages 160–161). Two alternative suggestions are that the king is the LORD, see Andersen and Freedman (page 553), or that the king is ineffective and powerless, see Wood (page 208). However, these alternative suggestions are difficult to support from versions.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for we do not revere the LORD:</strong> In this clause, the people give the reason why they have no king. They acknowledge that they failed to revere the LORD. In Hebrew, the word for <em>revere</em> is literally “fear.” For people to fear the LORD means that they have a relationship with him in which they submit to him, they are awed by him, and they are afraid to offend him.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>McComiskey (page 161).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because we didn’t fear the Lord (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because we didn’t honor the Lord (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>10:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>What can a king do for us?”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for example,</span> even if we<sup>(incl)</sup> had a king, could he help us <span data-bnType=\"implied\">now</span>? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">No!</span>”</p></li><li><p>And <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they will realize that</span> no king could benefit them now.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>What can a king do for us?:</strong> This statement expresses the people’s despair as they imagine what their situation would be like if they had a king.

Indicate this contrast in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a rhetorical question. The expected answer to this question is “nothing.” This rhetorical question is one way to express an attitude of hopelessness. This rhetorical question can also be translated as a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>As for the king, he couldn’t do anything for us. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This statement is hypothetical. It does not describe a real situation. Here is another way to indicate this imagined situation:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But would it help us to have a king?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a king:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase is literally “the king.” The name of the king is not given. This may indicate that “the king” refers to kings as a group. No human king could help them. It is not recommended that you give the name of a specific king here.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>It is also possible that the people thought of King Hoshea when they said “the king.” See McComiskey (page 161).</span></span></p>",

Versions that follow this interpretation describe the last phrase in terms of the “agreements” or <em>covenants</em> that they make <span data-bnType=\"implied\">mainly with each other</span>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They utter empty words, taking false oaths and <u>making empty agreements</u>.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They utter empty words and make false promises and <u>useless treaties</u>. (GNT) <em>(GNT, NAB, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions. However, a slight majority of commentaries favor interpretation (2).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The plural word forms in 10:3–5 support the understanding that the pronoun “they” in v.4 refers to the people. Most English versions also end the quote of what the people say about the king at the end of 3b. But Hosea is the speaker throughout these verses, and Hosea could be referring to either people or kings in general. Commentaries that support interpretation (1) include McComiskey, Wood, and Hubbard. Commentaries that support (2) include Stuart, Macintosh, Keil, Lange, and possibly Dearman. See Dearman (pages 263–265) for discussion of both points of view and the ambiguities involved.</span></span> Both the people of Israel and their kings break their promises and fail to keep their agreements, so if possible, translate in a way that will allow either interpretation. The meaning lines in the Display will follow this approach.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Hosea uses three phrases to describe the behavior of the people of Israel. These phrases are more literally “They speak words, swearing falsehood, making covenant[s].” The wording in some versions implies that there are three separate actions. It is not stated explicitly whether these actions are part of the same event. The wording in other versions implies one main action with further details in the next two phrases. These actions may or may not be part of the same event. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They utter mere words; with empty oaths they make covenants (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You may arrange these phrases either way in your translation. There is no significant difference in meaning. The meaning lines in the Display will give an example of each.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>They speak mere words:</strong> This is a Hebrew idiom. It means that the people do not intend to do what their words say.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See McComiskey (page 164) and the NET footnote on “utter empty words.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate it:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They make many promises (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they utter empty words (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>with false oaths:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase means that a person makes a very serious promise that he or she does not intend to keep.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The oath in this context probably refers to any serious promise. Alternatively, some versions understand this phrase to refer specifically to an oath sworn as part of making a covenant. For example, the RSV has, “with empty oaths they make covenants.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate it:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>make false promises (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they lie when they take oaths (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>they make covenants:</strong> In Hebrew, the word “covenant” refers to a formal agreement that has mutual obligations.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Commentaries that favor limiting the referent to an international treaty are Stuart, Keil, Macintosh, and Andersen and Freedman. Commentaries that favor a wider application of the term that perhaps may include international treaties but also other kinds of agreements are: Dearman, Hubbard, Wood, McComiskey, and Davies.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are four things this word can refer to in different contexts:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Agreements that the people of Israel make with one another.</p></li><li><p>An agreement that a king makes with the people.</p></li><li><p>A treaty or alliance that Israel makes with another nation.</p></li><li><p>A covenant that God makes with a person or a nation.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">In this context, it refers mainly to agreements that the people of Israel make with one another. This phrase implies that the people do not keep their agreements.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate it:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>making empty agreements (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>make covenants they don’t intend to keep (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>10:4b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:4b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So judgment springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of a field.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Therefore/So their lack of justice keeps increasing like poisonous weeds that grow/sprout in a plowed field.</p></li><li><p>The unfair/unjust way people treat one another is like poisonous weeds that spread in the furrows of a farmer’s field.</p></li><li><p>Because of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">these things that they do</span>, there are more and more unfair decisions in court. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">The situation is</span> like harmful/poisonous weeds that grow where good crops should be.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Unfair/Harmful</span> lawsuits and other court cases continually increase. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">They are</span> like poisonous weeds that cover/overgrow people’s gardens.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So judgment springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of a field:</strong> This clause is a simile. It compares the increasing injustice (see below) and other bitter disputes to poisonous weeds.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause gives the consequence of the people’s many promises that they do not keep, their false oaths, and broken covenants. The consequence is injustice.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Andersen and Freedman (page 554), McComiskey (page 164) and Keil (page 84).</span></span> Some versions express this relationship with a specific word such as <em>so</em> or “therefore.” Other versions leave it implied. Translate the connection between 10:4a and 10:4b in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>judgment:</strong> The Hebrew word for <em>judgment</em> here is literally “justice.” It has a broad range of meanings related to what is right and just, including laws, lawsuits, legal decisions, and judgment.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT (#2443c). Wood (page 208) says the term refers to lawsuits that arise due to denial of people’s legal rights. Macintosh (page 395) concludes that Rashi’s interpretation of justice” as “litigation” is the most likely. The BART interlinear suggests that the appropriate sense in BDB (page 1048b, sense 1.c) is “litigation before judges.” It also mentions HALOT sense 2, “probably dispute, case, litigation.” NIDOTTE (#5477) says that <em>mišpat</em> refers most frequently “to a judicial decision or verdict…as well as the execution of the sentence in punishment.”</span></span> It can involve the government, the courts, and any legal transactions between people in general.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to Hubbard (page 173), justice involves regulating the rights of the citizens. McComiskey (page 165) says there was a lack of fairness in the “legal transactions of Hosea’s day.” He further comments that in the Prophets, “justice is not limited only to kings or other judicial officials…The prophets most frequently apply it to the people.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the context of “justice” growing “like poisonous weeds,” it is clear that “justice” should be understood in the sense of injustice or justice that has degenerated into decisions or transactions that are unfair.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Pusey (page 100) calls it “injustice.” Dearman (page 265) refers to it as a “lack of justice.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are three ways to interpret this word in this context:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to any kind of injustice. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Justice has become injustice, growing like poisonous weeds in a plowed field.

It implies that these legal transactions are unjust or harmful. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and litigation spreads like a poisonous weed along the furrows of the fields (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Therefore legal disputes sprout up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of a plowed field. (NET) <em>(GW, NCV, NET, NIV, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers specifically to judgment, probably meaning a sentence of punishment.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Hosea has many references to the LORD’s judgment of the nation of Israel. These references describe the many different ways he will punish the nation. For two examples of the identification of judgment with punishment, see the paragraph summary for 9:6–9 and the Section summary for 10:9–15.</span></span> It implies that the judgment is unfair.

Both these interpretations have good commentary support. The first interpretation is more general, so it may apply to more situations. The second interpretation is supported by more lexicons.

Other scholars and all versions used in TN understand it to refer collectively to the people of Samaria.</span></span> In this verse, <em>Samaria</em>, the capital of Israel, is a figure of speech that represents the nation of Israel. Some versions make the name “Israel” explicit here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The people from Israel (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will fear for the calf:</strong> The expression <em>fear for</em> means to be concerned about someone or something.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>McComiskey (page 165) “dread or awe or fear for,” Macintosh (page 339) “be in dread concerning,” Davies (page 237) “trembled” or “trembled in fear,” Wood (page 208) “anxious about.”</span></span> The <em>calf</em> refers to an idol shaped like a calf. Here it refers to the people’s concern about their calf-idol.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Two ancient versions, the LXX and the Peshitta, translate the Hebrew verb as “dwell” instead of “fear.” Either sense is possible for this verb. The context determines which sense is intended. McComiskey (page 165) points out that “dwell” does not make sense in this context. In addition, the collocation “dwell for” does not occur anywhere else in the Old Testament. However, the collocation “fear/afraid for” does occur elsewhere. For example, Job 19:29 has: “<em>be afraid for</em> yourselves of the sword.”</span></span> They are fearful that the Assyrians will take it away from them. The phrase does not mean that the calf-idol frightens them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate 10:5a:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The people of Samaria tremble in fear for their calf idol (NLT96)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the people from Israel are worried about the calf-shaped idol (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Beth-aven:</strong> The term Beth-aven means “house of wickedness.” This is the name that Hosea normally uses for “Bethel.” See also the note on Beth-aven in 4:15b.</p><h4>10:5b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5b</sup>Indeed, <u>its people</u> <strong>will mourn</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5c</sup> <strong>with</strong> <u>its idolatrous priests</u>—</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">There is an ellipsis (deliberate omission) in 10:5c.

In this context, some scholars think that it indicates emphasis.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Keil (page 85), Stuart (page 156), and Hubbard (page 173). Another function of <em>ki</em> is to introduce a reason for the preceding clause.

These same people also mourn for it.</span></span> The difference is that interpretation (1) focuses more on their place of residence. Interpretation (2) focuses more on their devotion to the idol. Many versions are ambiguous.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>will mourn:</strong> This phrase means that the people will express their sorrow over the loss of their calf idol. Normally people mourn when a family member or other loved one dies.

It is used only for pagan priests.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>McComiskey (page 166).</span></span> This line refers to the priests that were associated with the worship of the calf idol.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The pronoun referent in the phrase <em>its idolatrous priests</em> is parallel to the phrase “its people” in 10:5b, so the referent of both phrases is probably Samaria. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>5b</sup> <u>Samaria’s people</u> mourn over it</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>5c</sup> <u>and Samaria’s pagan priests</u> wail for it</p></blockquote><h4>10:5d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:5d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>those who rejoiced in its glory—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Everyone who</span> used to rejoice over its beauty <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will mourn</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">though</span> they exult <span data-bnType=\"implied\">now</span> in its splendor and great value.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those who rejoiced in its glory:</strong> In Hebrew, this line is a clause that is more literally “they rejoice on its glory.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some versions translate this as a clause as it is in the Hebrew. For example, the NCV has: “They used to shout for joy about its glory.”</span></span> This line further describes the mourners in 10:5b–c. They normally rejoice over the calf’s splendor.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The rejoicing of the people in 10:5d contrasts with their mourning in 10:b-c. In Hebrew, the form of the verb “rejoice” here indicates incomplete or continuous action. In this context, it may refer to habitual rejoicing in the past or in the present.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to show this contrast:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use past tense. One example is the BSB above. Here are other examples:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those who rejoiced over it and over its glory (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They used to shout for joy about its glory (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a clause that indicates an unexpected result. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Those that worship the calf will mourn over it, although they now praise its glory with joy.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>those who rejoiced:</strong> The last antecedent of <em>those</em> is “its idolatrous priests.” But since “its people” and “its idolatrous priests” are parallel terms, it probably refers to both these groups, not only to the priests.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Hubbard (page 173). The LXX and Syriac also support the reference to both people and priests.</span></span> Many versions are ambiguous. You should either translate in a way that is ambiguous or in a way that can refer to both these groups.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>rejoiced:</strong> There is a textual issue with this word:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Hebrew word in the Masoretic text means “rejoice.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They used to shout for joy about its glory (NCV) <em>(BSB, ESV, KJV, NCV, NIV, NJB, NJPS)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Some scholars think that the original text was “cry/wail.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They will wail when it is stripped of its golden splendor. (GNT) <em>(CEV, GNT, GW, NABRE, NASB, NET, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1). The LXX also supports this option. There is no support for option (2) from Hebrew manuscripts or ancient versions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>its glory:</strong> This refers to the glory or splendor of the calf.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In Hosea 4:7 “their Glory” is a title or designation for the LORD. McComiskey (page 166) and Keil (page 85) suggest that the people attributed divinity, perhaps Yahweh’s divinity to the calf-idol. Similarly, Dearman (pages 265–266) suggests that the people may have regarded the calf as a representative of divinity/Yahweh. Hubbard (page 174) identifies its glory as the esteem shown by those who worshiped it. Macintosh (pages 399–400) regards its glory as wealth.</span></span> The term <em>glory</em> here could indicate that those who worshiped the calf thought that it was a deity. It could also refer to a physical attribute such as beauty or to its monetary value.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate <em>its glory</em>:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>its deity/godlikeness</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>its beauty/magnificence</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>its great value</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be appropriate and natural to use more than one of these terms.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 10:5b–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">10:5b–c describes action in the near future. 10:5d describes action in the past or perhaps both past and present. In some languages, it may be more natural to rearrange the verse parts to first describe past and present action before speaking of future action. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5b–c</sup>The people and priests <sup>5d</sup>rejoice now over the glory of the calf-idol <sup>5b–c</sup>but they will soon mourn over it.</p></blockquote></div><h4>10:5e–6a</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10:5e</sup>for <u>it has been taken from them</u> <strong>into exile</strong>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10:6a</sup>Yes, <u>it will be carried</u> <strong>to Assyria as tribute to the great king</strong>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">These lines give the reason why the people mourned and why they could no longer rejoice over the glory of the calf. It is because that glory will be taken away when the calf is taken into exile.</p><h4>10:5e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:5e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for it has been taken from them into exile.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Because its beauty is gone. It has been taken from them into another country.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They will mourn,</span> because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the enemy</span> will take its splendor and godlikeness away from them to their own country.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for it has been taken from them into exile:</strong> In Hebrew, this clause begins with the word <em>ki</em> (see 10:5b). Here <em>ki</em> introduces the reason that the people mourned. Many versions translate it with the word <em>for</em> or “because.” Use a natural way in your language to introduce this reason.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Hebrew clause is more literally: “<u>it</u> has departed (or “gone into exile”) from <u>it</u>.” Each pronoun has more than one possible referent. Also the Hebrew verb can mean either “depart/leave” or “go into exile.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDB (#1540) 2. remove, depart. 3. go into exile. HALOT (electronic ed., page 191) 2a. to (have to) leave, disappear. 2b. to go into exile.</span></span> For these reasons, there are various ways to interpret this clause.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are two main interpretations:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“It” (the glory) has left “it” (the calf idol).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>McComiskey (page 166) comments that it is best to understand the subject of this verb to be “its glory” which has departed from the calf, rather than the calf itself which has departed from the people.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>its glory will be taken away into captivity. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the glory that has departed from it. (NRSV) <em>(GNT, GW, NASB, NET, NJPS, NLT, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>“It” (the calf idol) has gone into exile from “it” (Beth-aven or Israel).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Andersen and Freedman (page 556) comments that this clause describes physical removal, not just the loss of splendor. It says almost the same thing as Hosea 10:6a. Stuart (pages 161–162) and Keil (page 85) also support this view. All three commentators assume that “glory” is a designation that refers to the idol.</span></span> The idol is taken to Assyria either as plunder or as a gift for the king of Assyria. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for the image of their god which is carried away into exile. (REB) <em>(BSB, CEV, ESV, NIV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with a majority of versions. It makes good sense to understand the Hebrew pronouns here to refer to the calf and the calf’s glory as in 10:5d.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>It also makes good sense of the introductory phrase “It also” in the next verse. The phrase refers to the calf that is carried to Assyria in addition to the departure of the glory of the calf. See the following note for more information.</span></span> However, interpretation (2) is also acceptable. It makes good sense if 10:6a is understood to be parallel to 10:5e.</p>",

However, they differ from the others in their proposal that “Samaria’s king” refers to the calf idol, not a human king.</span></span> The Hebrew phrase “Samaria her king” means the “king of Samaria.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Hebrew phrase “Samaria its king” is unusual. The expected construction is “king of Samaria.” Some commentators categorize this phrase as a “casus pendens,” also called “topic and comment.” It could be translated “As for Samaria, its king will be destroyed.” See Macintosh (page 406), McComiskey (page 168) and Hubbard (page 175).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The king of Samaria will be carried away, like a piece of wood on water.

It is the most accepted way to understand the difficult Hebrew text.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In all three interpretations, Gibeah/hills symbolize moral depravity in Israel. All three interpretations imply that a future war will be fought against the moral depravity in Israel. It will be analogous to the past war fought in Gibeah. Interpretation (1) states this most directly. Interpretation (2) implies it by way of comparison with the past war in Gibeah. Just as the sins in Gibeah resulted in war in the past, so too the sins of Israel will result in a future war. Interpretation (3) implies it in a different way. The past war against Gibeah did not eradicate moral depravity. The people of Israel continued to sin in similar ways. In Hosea’s time a war against the moral depravity of Israel had not yet been fought. But it will come.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate this clause:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question.

(NCV)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NCV shows an alternative understanding of two Hebrew words. The Hebrew word for “not” is understood here to be a particle meaning, “surely” or “indeed.” Thus instead of saying, “will not war overwhelm them” it is, “war will surely overwhelm them.” For more detail see Andersen and Freedman (page 564) and Hubbard (page 177). Secondly, the Hebrew word for “against” is understood here to indicate, “because of.” Thus, instead of saying a war is “against evildoers” it is a war “because of the evil they have done there.” See Hubbard (page 177).</span></span></p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>overtake:</strong> The Hebrew word here means to “catch up to” or to “take hold upon” something or someone.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT (#1422).</span></span> Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>overwhelm them (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>catch up with them (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will soon experience</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the sons of iniquity:</strong> The Hebrew phrase is literally, “sons of injustice.” The Hebrew word for “injustice” means to act contrary to what is right.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT (#1580b). The Hebrew word in the Masoretic text has two letters transposed. That word is unknown. But other Hebrew manuscripts have this word, so most scholars assume that this is the correct word here. See Macintosh (page 412).</span></span> Here the expression refers to people that are as evil as those at Gibeah.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in Gibeah:</strong> The word “gibeah” literally means “hills.” Here the word <em>Gibeah</em> is probably a word play. It refers both to the city of <em>Gibeah</em> and also to the hills that Hosea calls “high places” in 10:8a, where the Israelites worshiped idols.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>If so, this would be similar to the word play on Jezreel in 1:11d and 2:22–23. This understanding is supported by Stuart (page 168) who suggests that Gibeah may be a double-entendre, which could be translated as “in the hills.” Also Hubbard (page 176) suggests that the accusation, “you have sinned,” together with the name Gibeah itself which means ‘hill,’ serves to connect v 9 to v 8, where Bethel is called the sin of Israel and the hills are summoned to fall on the Israelites.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you add a footnote to explain the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Gibeah means “hills.” See Hosea 10:8.</p></blockquote>",

It is supported by all modern versions as well as the LXX and Peshitta. The phrase that is written in the MT (<u>Kethib</u>) is “for their two eyes.” The word “eyes” might refer to “rings.” The Targum mentions “its two rings.” No versions follow this option. See Soulen (page 100) for more information on <em>Qere/Kethib</em> issues.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for their two sins (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for their two crimes (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for:</strong> This word introduces the reason that the people of Israel will be bound.

If a literal meaning was intended, it is possible that the people knew implicitly which two sins these were.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Commentators offer numerous suggestions. Some examples are: idolatry and reliance on foreign nations, rejection of God and David, Israel’s past and present sins. See Kidner (page 96). However there is no consensus among scholars on this issue.</span></span> If the intended meaning was figurative, this phrase may be an idiom that meant their sins were serious and/or numerous.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Stuart (page 169) suggests that the phrase may state metaphorically that Israel’s wickedness was extreme. Kidner (page 96) suggests that the phrase may mean Israel’s repeated or persistent acts of disobedience.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are two translation options for this phrase:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate literally.

It matches the pattern of other metaphors in the chapters and verses surrounding this one. Those metaphors depict Israel in her early years, when the LORD chose her to be his people. The metaphors contrast this with Israel in her later years, when the people rebelled against the LORD.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example, see Hosea 9:10; 10:1; 11:1–5.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Ephraim:</strong> The tribe of <em>Ephraim</em> is probably a figure of speech (synecdoche) that represents all the people of the nation of Israel. Some versions make “Israel” explicit here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Israel was once like a well-trained young cow (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>well-trained heifer:</strong> The word <em>heifer</em> refers to a young (female) cow that has not yet given birth.

Also Stuart (page 165).

For example, the KJV may or may not imply that a yoke was placed upon the heifer’s neck:<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Keil (page 87) suggests that the MT word means “to treat harshly” and that it refers to putting a heavy yoke upon the neck. This meaning would correspond to option (1) rather than (2). The ASV and KJV may reflect this meaning.</span></span></p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but I passed over upon her fair neck (KJV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1) along with the most versions.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The main distinction between option (1) and option (2) is the time period in view. In option (1) the time reference is to the period when the yoke is placed on the calf. It marks the time when the calf’s life of ease has ended. In option (2) the time reference is to the period before the yoke is placed on the calf. It continues to describe the calf’s life of ease when it loved to thresh. There is no disagreement that the work of plowing depicted in the next clause requires that the calf will have a yoke or harness at that time.</span></span> This clause indicates that the easy life of the heifer is finished. It introduces the time for heavy work to begin.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>but I:</strong> In this context, there are two main ways to interpret the function of the word that begins this clause:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The word indicates contrast.

(NLT) <em>(BSB, CEV, ESV, GNT, NASB, NJB, NLT, NRSV)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The ESV and NRSV introduce this clause with “and.” They have been listed here as indicating contrast because they introduce the next clause with “but,” so the overall meaning is contrastive.</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The word indicates result. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so I will put a yoke on her fair neck (NIV) <em>(NIV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions. Several versions leave the connection implied. These versions have not been listed.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>yoke:</strong> A <em>yoke</em> is a bar or frame that is attached to the necks of (normally) two work animals. In the context of 11c–e, the yoke is attached by a harness so that they can pull a plow or harrow.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Webster’s New World Dictionary “yoke,” “harness.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>fair neck:</strong> This phrase is literally “goodness of its neck.” It refers to the neck of an animal that has not yet been yoked to do hard work, but is well suited for it. Versions translate “goodness” in a variety of ways:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Most versions use a term that refers mainly to appearance.

Stuart (page 169–170) focuses entirely on strength. Hubbard (page 180) says it is “strong, well-proportioned.” Macintosh (page 418) suggests “firmness of her neck” and specifies “not so much beautiful but well formed and apt for his purpose.” McComiskey (page 176) focuses more on appearance: “the sleek beauty of the animal’s neck.” Lange (page 81) also focuses on appearance: “beauty, alluding to her fatness.”</span></span></p><h4>10:11c–e</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning:<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Andersen and Freedman (page 568) suggest that these are three parallel lines of a tricolon.</span></span></p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>11c</sup> <u>I will harness</u> <strong>Ephraim</strong>,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>11d</sup> <strong>Judah</strong> <u>will plow</u>,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>11e</sup>and <strong>Jacob</strong> <u>will break the hard ground</u>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will harness Ephraim, Judah will plow, and Jacob will break the hard ground:</strong> This part of the metaphor compares Ephraim, Judah and Jacob implicitly to farm animals that do heavy work.

Macintosh (page 422) suggests that the prepositions “to” and “according to” denote the principle with regard to which an action is accomplished. Hubbard (page 181) states similarly that “righteousness” and “love” describe the manner in which true sowing and reaping take place.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate these two commands:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Sow for yourselves righteousness; reap steadfast love (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Sow justice, and reap loyalty.

In order to plant seeds they must first prepare the ground by loosening up the soil. In this metaphor the hard, unplowed ground is similar to the people’s stubborn hearts or minds. That hardness must become soft.

The reason to sow righteousness, reap love and break up hard ground is because it is time to seek him. Some versions make it clear that this is a reason by using a word such as “for.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Break up the unplowed ground for yourselves, <u>for</u> it is time to seek the LORD (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions leave it implied that this is a reason. Some use punctuation to indicate it. For example, the NJB has a colon that implies reason:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>break up your fallow ground<u>:</u> it is time to seek out Yahweh (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>it is time:</strong> This phrase indicates that the people should not delay to seek the LORD. The words may add a sense of urgency to the command.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Keil (pages 87–88) and Davies (page 246) both suggest that the force of the command is equivalent to the English expression “it is high time.” This expression means that it should have happened a long time ago. See The Free Dictionary by Farlex.</span></span> Some versions make this urgency explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>for <u>now</u> is the time to seek the Lord (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>to seek the LORD:</strong> This phrase implies serious and persistent effort. It may refer to a time of distress or crisis in which the people turn away from their sin and turn to him in order to worship and serve him.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Stuart (page 170) and Davies (page 246).</span></span> For more information on what it means to <em>seek the LORD</em>, see the note on 3:5a.</p><h4>10:12e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:12e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>until He comes and sends righteousness upon you like rain.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>until he comes to cause you<sup>(plur)</sup> to experience his goodness that is like <span data-bnType=\"implied\">refreshing</span> rain/showers.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Continue to worship/serve him</span> until he returns to make you good and just and loyal.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>until He comes and sends righteousness upon you like rain:</strong> In this clause, Hosea tells the people how long they should seek the LORD and what his response will be when they seek him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>until He comes:</strong> They should seek the LORD <em>until He comes</em>. This phrase is a figurative way to say that the LORD will restore his relationship with them. He will be gracious to them again.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Keil (pages 87–88).</span></span> This statement implies that previously the LORD had withdrawn from them.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Davies (page 247).</span></span> See 5:6 and 5:15 for more information.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and sends righteousness upon you like rain:</strong> More literally, this clause part says “he will rain down righteousness on you.” The words <em>like rain</em> or showers imply that the righteousness he gives is refreshing and life-giving.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Dearman (pages 271–272) and Stuart (page 170).</span></span> The phrase indicates that the LORD will treat them justly and bless them according to what is right.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Stuart (page 170) and McComiskey (page 178).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>righteousness</em> here is the same Hebrew word as in 12a, that the people are to sow.

It also compares the LORD to the loving parent of the child. The figure of speech here may refer indirectly to Exodus 4:22, 23. There it says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>22</sup>Then say to Pharaoh, ‘This is what the Lord says: Israel is my firstborn son, <sup>23</sup>and I told you, “Let my son go, so he may worship me.”….’ ”</p></blockquote><h4>11:1a–b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:1a–b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(combined/reordered)</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yahweh says,</span> “When I called/told the people of Israel to leave Egypt, I loved them and chose them to be my own children.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallel parts that are similar in meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1a</sup> <u>When Israel was a child</u>, <strong>I loved him</strong>,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1b</sup>and <u>out of Egypt</u> <strong>I called My son</strong>.</p></blockquote><h4>11:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>When Israel was a child, I loved him,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ “When <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the nation of</span> Israel was still a child, I showed my love to him.</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yahweh says,</span> “I have loved Israel from the time he was a child.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>When Israel was a child, I loved him:</strong> These clauses refer to the time when Israel became a new/young nation during the exodus from Egypt.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Hosea uses a similar figure of speech in 2:15.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I loved Israel when he was a child.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>child:</strong> The Hebrew word for <em>child</em> is masculine here. It can refer to a very young boy just weaned or to an older child or young man.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT (#1389a)</span></span> In 11:3, it describes a young child who is still learning to walk and needs the protection and care of his parents.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Hubbard (pages 186–187)</span></span> Use a word in your language that refers to a young male child of that age.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>loved:</strong> The Hebrew word for “love” has a broad range of meaning.

It was also when he summoned the people of Israel to leave Egypt.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Andersen and Freedman (page 577), Keil (page 89), Stuart (page 178), Dearman (Kindle Location 3650), Macintosh (page 437), McComiskey (page 184) and Hubbard (page 187).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And called him out of Egypt as my son.

Many versions follow meaning (a) and leave meaning (b) implied.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 11:1</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may not be natural to refer to a nation as a child or a son (singular). It may be necessary to use plural terms such as children or sons. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lord says, “I have great love for the descendants of Israel, who are like <u>my children</u>. When <u>they</u> were young, I called <u>them</u> to leave Egypt. (Tuwali Ifugao Back Translation)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">It may also be more natural to combine and/or reorder the verse parts. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The LORD says, <sup>1b</sup>“When I summoned the people of Israel to leave Egypt, <sup>1a</sup>I loved <u>them</u> and chose <u>them</u> to be <u>my own children</u>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">If you use plural terms, as in the preceding examples, consider adding a footnote for the benefit of readers who may not see the connection with Matthew 2:15. Here is a suggested footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In the Hebrew language, this verse refers to Israel as “child (singular)” and “my son.” See Matthew 2:15.</p></blockquote></div>",

Hubbard (page 188) says that “the truth should have been obvious.” Andersen &amp; Freedman (page 581) says, “The people are blamed for rejecting knowledge gained by experience of Yahweh’s healing, not for mere ignorance.” Commentaries in favor of “did not know/realize” include Davies, Garrett, McComiskey, and Wood. Wood (page 212) says that “they were blind to his healing purpose.” Garrett (page 223–224) says they “quickly forgot how the Lord repeatedly restored health.”</span></span> At this time in Israel’s history, the LORD was leading his people through the desert, and Moses told them that it was the LORD who healed them (Exodus 15:26). So the people must have realized this.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Much later, after they were settled in the land of Canaan, it is possible that everyone had forgotten these stories. See Joshua 24:31.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">These words are similar to the phrase “she does not acknowledge” in 2:8a. See the comment there. In both places, the meaning is probably that the people were aware of the truth but refused to acknowledge it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they have ignored My healing care. (NJPS)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They would not admit that I was the one who had healed them. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>healed:</strong> This word probably refers here to more than just physical healing. In this context, it refers to the many ways that the LORD helped Israel, especially in times of trouble in the wilderness of Sinai.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The wider meaning of “heal” is mentioned by Keil (page 90), Dearman (page 282), Hubbard (page 188), and Davies.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, the word definitely includes the idea of physical healing, and most of the versions used in TN use a form of that word. In Exodus 15:26, the LORD promised that if the people obeyed him, he would keep them from getting any of the diseases that he had caused the Egyptians to suffer, “For I am the LORD who heals you” (BSB). And in Numbers 21:6–10, the LORD directed Moses to provide a bronze snake on a pole. All those who had been bitten by poisonous snakes and would have died were miraculously healed when they looked at the snake.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions translate the word <em>healed</em> here as “cared for” or “took care of.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I took care of them (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you translate the term in a similar way, it is recommended that you also use a term in your language that refers to physical healing.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In the four other references in Hosea where a form of the Hebrew for “heal” occurs, it refers to physical healing or treating of wounds in 5:13 and 6:1 and to figurative healing of Israel from sin in 7:1 and 14:4. It does not occur elsewhere in Hosea in the generic sense of “take care of.”</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but they have ignored my <u>healing care</u> (NJPS)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but they refused to admit that it was I who healed them and cared for them.</p></blockquote>",

The earlier sections focus more on the LORD’s punishment. The people will be taken into exile. This section focuses more on his love.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The LORD speaks of his love for Israel in the past (11:1–4), warns them of their future exile and destruction (11:5–7), and assures them that in the future he will turn from his anger and show them compassion. Because of his love for them, he promises that he will bring the people back to the land of Israel (11:8–11).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples of section headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lord’s Love for Israel (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Israel Is Like a Bad Son (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Throughout this section, the LORD is the speaker. When he refers to himself, he uses first person pronouns (“I/me/my”) except for verse 10, which has “Yahweh” and “he.” When he refers to the people or nation of Israel, he uses “Ephraim,” “they/them,” or “he/it.” The only exceptions are in 11:8–9.

It can also have the figurative meaning “to lead a person.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT (electronic edition, page. 645) and BDB (#4900).</span></span> In this context, the word may refer to the time when the LORD led his people out of Egypt.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Macintosh (page 445).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with cords of kindness, with ropes of love:</strong> These phrases describe how the LORD led his people.

An alternative suggestion by Garrett (pages 224–225) is that the phrase “human ropes” refers to Moses. Another is that the intended meaning is “leather ropes,” as in the NET. Neither alternative has significant scholarly support.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The parallel phrase <em>ropes of love</em> has a similar meaning. It implies that the LORD showed love toward his people when he led them. He was like a gentle herdsman who cared for his animals with compassion.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Macintosh (page 448) suggests that Yahweh is depicted as leading Israel as a considerate farmer, who from time to time leads his beast away from the rigors of plowing for rest and refreshment.</span></span></p><h4>11:4a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:4a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I led them with cords of kindness,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I led them with ropes <span data-bnType=\"implied\">made</span> of kindness,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Like a kind herdsman</span> I led them gently with ropes.</p></li></ul></div><h4>11:4b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:4b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>with ropes of love;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>with straps <span data-bnType=\"implied\">made</span> of love.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I guided them</span> compassionately with cords.</p></li></ul></div><h4>11:4c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:4c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I lifted the yoke from their necks and bent down to feed them.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I removed the yoke from their neck.

HALOT (electronic edition, page 1205) assigns the meaning “revoke, lift, take away” to the verb phrase used in Hosea 11:4.</span></span> However, some scholars think that interpretation (2) better fits the common usage of some of the Hebrew words in this phrase.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Hebrew phrase “lift a yoke” is not normally used for removing a yoke. The normal Hebrew expression is “break a yoke.” For example, see Genesis 27:40; Leviticus 26:13; Jeremiah 5:5; Ezekiel 34:27. Also, the Hebrew preposition “on” indicates that a yoke is on the animal, not removed from it. See Keil (page 90), Garrett (pages 224–225), and McComiskey (page 185).</span></span> So it is recommended that you add a footnote with the other interpretation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Another interpretation of this phrase in Hebrew is: I became to them as one who lightens the weight of the yoke on their jaws.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this verse part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I removed the yokes from their necks (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>lifted the yoke from their neck</em> may refer figuratively to freeing the people of Israel from slavery. In this metaphor, their hardship was compared to the yoke that was attached by a harness so that the animal could pull a plow or cart.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>yoke:</strong> There is a textual issue concerning the word <em>yoke</em> in this clause:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Masoretic Text has <em>yoke</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and I became to them as one who lifts the yoke from their jaws (NASB) <em>(BSB, ESV, GW, KJV, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, NJPS, NLT, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Some scholars think that the original text had “infant.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Favored by Davies (page 257) and Hubbard (page 189).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was to them like those who lift infants to their cheeks. (NRSV) <em>(CEV, GNT, NIV2011, NJB, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1) along with a majority of versions and commentaries.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This interpretation is favored by Dearman, Garrett, Kidner, Andersen and Freedman, Keil, Stuart, Wood, Macintosh, and McComiskey. Dearman (pages 282–285) sees parallels with Isaiah 30:28 “harness on the jaws” and Hosea 10:11 that depicts Israel as a heifer.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">A <em>yoke</em> is an arched frame normally placed on the shoulders of a work animal at the base of its neck.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Andersen and Freedman (page 581).</span></span> Generally the yoke is fastened to two animals and is attached to a cart or plow that they pull together.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The word “yoke” can have negative or positive associations, depending on the kind of yoke. For example, 1 Kings 12:4 has: “Your father put a heavy yoke on us. But now you should lighten the burden of your father’s service and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you.” Whereas, Matthew 11:30 has: “For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>their necks:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase is literally “their jaws.” This probably indicates that here the word “yoke” refers both to the yoke and also to the halter or bridle around the animal’s jaws, that was used to direct the animal.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Macintosh (page 446).</span></span> See the 2nd ML in the Display for 11:4c for a way to make this explicit in your translation.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and bent down to feed them:</strong> The Hebrew phrase here is literally “and I bent down to him I fed.” There are three main interpretations of the Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>bent down</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Hebrew word means “I bent down.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I bent down to them and fed them. (ESV) <em>(BSB, CEV, ESV, GNT, GW, NASB, NCV, NIV, NJB, NKJV, NLT, REB, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Hebrew word means “gently.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and gently fed them (NET) <em>(NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Hebrew word means “I offer.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and I laid meat unto them (KJV) <em>(KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions. It follows a common meaning of the Hebrew word.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDB (#5186). See Davies (page 257), Hubbard (page 189) and Wood (page 213). One grammatical difficulty with this interpretation is that the Hebrew text lacks a conjunction between “bent down” and “I fed.” Andersen and Freedman (page 583) point out, however, that a lack of conjunctions is typical of Hosea.</span></span> Some scholars also support interpretation (2).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Among those who support this understanding are rabbinic commentator, ibn Ezra, cited in Macintosh (page 446), Garrett, Keil, and McComiskey. However, only a small minority of versions follow it.</span></span> In both interpretations, the LORD feeds them in a loving way.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>feed them:</strong> The Hebrew text has “I fed.” English versions supply the object <em>them</em> or “him,” which is required to make the translation sound more natural in English. You may also need to supply an object here if it will sound more natural in your language.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 11:4</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The Hebrew text uses both plural and singular pronouns to refer to those whom the LORD cared for. In many languages, it is not natural to alternate pronouns in this way. Many versions translate all the pronouns in 11:4 as plural or else all the pronouns as singular. You should translate the pronouns in a natural way in your language. The Display uses plural pronouns, as in the BSB. An example of using singular pronouns is the NLT:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I led Israel along with my ropes of kindness and love. I lifted the yoke from <u>his</u> neck, and I myself stooped to feed <u>him</u>. (NLT)</p></blockquote></div>",

A similar result can be attained without any change to the Hebrew text. Andersen and Freedman (page 587) suggest that the phrase, “and to a height” refers to an unspecified false god. The CEV translation may be an example of this interpretation. It has, “My people are determined to reject me for a god they think is stronger, but he can’t help.”</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they call to Baal (NET) <em>(NET, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1).

The LXX and Peshitta translate “height” as “God.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Though:</strong> This word is not in the Hebrew text. The BSB supplies it to make explicit the logical relationship between the first clause of the sentence “they call to the Most High” and the second clause “he will by no means exalt them.” The logical relationship is that the people’s action of calling to the LORD does not result in the LORD exalting them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to indicate this connection:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>To the Most High they call, <u>but</u> he does not raise them up at all.

The earlier sections focus more on the LORD’s punishment. The people will be taken into exile.

How could I treat you like Zeboiim?:</strong> In both questions, the LORD asks himself if he can destroy Israel as he destroyed these two cities. In some languages, it may be helpful to make explicit that these two clauses are about destruction. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>How can I <u>destroy</u> you like Admah or <u>demolish</u> you like Zeboiim? (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>How:</strong> See comment above on <em>How</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>could I make you like…could I treat you like:</strong> In this context, the Hebrew words for <em>make you</em> and <em>treat you</em> have similar meanings.

McComiskey (page 191) notes the similar use of <em>hapak</em> here to Lamentations 1:20.

It fits better with following context of 11:9 in which the LORD describes what he no longer plans to do. It also allows the second interpretation. His change of heart is based on his strong compassion for his people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>McComiskey (page 191) notes that the people would indeed go into captivity, but God would not invalidate the promise of the land.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this verse part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>My heart will not let me do it! (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>A change of heart moves me (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>within Me:</strong> In this context, the Hebrew word indicates the location where the decisions/emotions take place.</p><h4>11:8f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:8f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>My compassion is stirred!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I am completely overwhelmed by feelings of pity.</p></li><li><p>I love you too much <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to destroy you like that</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">There Hebrew is a word here which means “together.” Here it gives emphasis to the intensity of the emotion that the LORD feels. Some versions leave this word implicit. Some others indicate this intensity in a different way. The BSB indicates the intensity with the exclamation point at the end of the sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am <u>deeply</u> moved. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Indicate the intensity of emotion in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>compassion:</strong> The Hebrew word refers to an emotion of compassion and pity.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his children will come trembling from the west.

It may also indicate an attitude of humility.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Wood (page 214) and Andersen and Freedman (page 592)</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his sons shall come <u>frightened</u> from the west (NASB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the word <em>trembling</em> as a reference to the movement of birds that flutter their wings when they are startled.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT (electronic edition, page 1047). The way the children come is explicitly compared to birds in the next verse which says, “they will come trembling like birds…”</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his children will come <u>fluttering</u> from the west (NJB)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">In Hebrew, the phrase <em>will come trembling</em> is more literally “and they will tremble.” The word <em>come</em> is not in the Hebrew text. It is supplied in the BSB and in many other versions. The meaning <em>come</em> is considered to be implied because of the following phrase “from the west.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to a NET footnote, when the verb <em>haraḏ</em> “to tremble” is used with prepositions of direction, it denotes “to go or come trembling.” Also McComiskey (page 195) and Macintosh (page 466).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>from the west:</strong> This phrase describes one of the directions from which the children come. The Hebrew word for <em>west</em> is literally “sea.” This word designates the coastlands and islands of the Mediterranean Sea. Since the Mediterranean is west of Israel, the Hebrew word “sea” is also the word for <em>west</em>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>McComiskey (page 195).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase implies that some of the people of Israel have relocated to the lands west of Israel.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 11:10</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"2\">In 11:10, the LORD continues to speak.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Andersen and Freedman (page 591) and McComiskey (page 195).</span></span> However, there is a change from first person pronouns that refer to the LORD, such as “I” and “my,” to third person pronouns, such as “he” and “his.” This kind of change is typical of Hosea’s writing style.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, this change of pronouns may sound awkward and unnatural. If this is true in your language, you can continue to use first person pronouns here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>My</u> people will follow <u>me</u> when <u>I</u> roar like a lion at their enemies. They will hurry to <u>me</u> from the west. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural to combine some of the parallel parts. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I, the LORD, will roar like a lion, and my children will return, trembling from the west. (CEV)</p></blockquote></div>",

Hosea continues to describe Israel, giving examples from the life of their ancestor Jacob to show that Israel followed his bad behavior (12:2–8). The LORD then reminded the people how they had responded wickedly when he led them in the past (12:9–11). Hosea concludes this section by comparing Jacob’s care of sheep in Aram with the LORD’s care of his people through a prophet or prophets.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples of section headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Israel’s Sin (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Israel and Judah Are Condemned (GNT)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1028011012\" data-endVerseId=\"1028012001\"><h3>Paragraph 11:12–12:1</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, the LORD brings charges against both Israel and Judah.

It proposes that the Hebrew term for God here, <em>‘el</em>, refers to a pagan <em>‘el</em>, rather than to YHWH. Likewise with “holy ones.” This view is favored by Andersen and Freedman (pages 600–603), Hubbard (page 199) and Garrett (pages 229–231).</span></span></p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>These lines say that Judah remains faithful to God. The meaning of the word “roamed” is “follow.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT (electronic edition, page 1194) cites Wolff “but Judah still goes about with God.” Andersen and Freedman (page 602) notes that this is the traditional interpretation.</span></span> The people of Judah continue to follow God. The word “faithful” refers to Judah.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In this interpretation, the parallel lines of the Hebrew text form a chiasm: Judah still (A) it has roamed (B) with God; (B’) and with [the] holy [one(s)] (A’) faithful.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But Judah still roams about with God; he remains faithful to the Holy One. (NET) <em>(BSB, ESV, KJV, NET, NJPS, NJB, NLT, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>These lines say that Judah wanders from God who is faithful. The meaning of the word “roamed” is “wander restlessly.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDB (#7300). This Hebrew word normally has connotations of rebellion. Davies (page 270).</span></span> The word “faithful” refers to God.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In this interpretation the faithfulness of God is contrasted with the rebellious nature of the people of Judah.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and the people of Judah are still rebelling against me, the faithful and holy God.

The people of Israel surrounded God with lies and deceit, but Judah continued to follow God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>still:</strong> The word <em>still</em> refers to something that continues. Here it indicates the continuation of a past or present event.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT (#1576a).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>walks:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>walks</em>, means “to roam about freely” or “to wander.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT (electronic edition, page 1194).</span></span> The meaning can be positive or negative. Here the word is used in a positive way. See the interpretations above.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>with:</strong> The Hebrew word has meanings such as <em>with</em>, “beside,” “by,” or “accompanying.” It is commonly used of a close relationship.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT (#1640b).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>God:</strong> Here the Hebrew word for God is <em>el</em> and not <em>YHWH</em>. This is the same word as in 11:9c. Some versions translate <em>el</em> as <em>God</em> instead of “LORD.” Use your general term for God here.</p><h4>11:12d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:12d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and is faithful to the Holy One.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He is firm <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in his commitment to</span> the Holy One.</p></li><li><p>They are loyal to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">me,</span> the Holy One.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>faithful:</strong> The Hebrew word means “to prove to be firm, reliable, faithful.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT (electronic edition, p. 63) nifal.</span></span> The word commonly applies to trust in God.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Andersen and Freedman (page 603) and Macintosh (page 475).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Holy One:</strong> This term is more literally “and with holy [ones].” The term <em>Holy One</em> is also in 11:9. See 11:9d “the Holy One among you.” In 11:9 the word is singular. Here it is plural. It is probably an honorific plural, also called a plural of majesty.

Hosea 12:2 says that the LORD will punish Jacob according to his ways. Examples from Jacob’s life immediately follow in 12:3. It is reasonable to assume that these are examples of behavior or character traits that deserve punishment. Most versions and commentaries support this interpretation.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A number of versions make interpretation (1) explicit, especially in 12:3.

In some languages, it may be necessary to supply the missing words from the second line. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2c</sup>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">He will</span> <u>repay him</u> <strong>according to his deeds</strong></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In these lines, Hosea tells the descendants of Jacob that the LORD will punish them. The first line is a general statement. The second and third lines give more detail. He includes the people of Judah and the people of Israel. He will punish them fairly, just as they deserve.</p><h4>12:2a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:2a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The LORD also brings a charge against Judah.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Yahweh has a complaint/quarrel against the people of Judah,</p></li><li><p>¶ Yahweh accuses Judah <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of wickedness</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The LORD also brings a charge against Judah:</strong> Here <em>Judah</em> is parallel with “Jacob” in line 2b. This line is a figure of speech (synecdoche) in which <em>Judah</em> refers to all the descendants of Jacob. So the charge against the southern kingdom of Judah is also a charge against the northern kingdom of Israel.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Stuart (page 190) suggests that this is an example of ascending parallelism in which a smaller subset of the whole (i.e. Judah) comes first in order. Although Judah is mentioned first, the charge is against the whole people. Others that agree both kingdoms are in view are Keil, Dearman, McComiskey, Hubbard, and Wood.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>charge:</strong> The Hebrew word means “to fight with words,” as in a quarrel or a legal case. The same word is used in Hosea 4:1, where the BSB translates it as “case.” In both verses, some English versions use an expression that refers to an actual trial.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some who understand it as legal terminology describing a court case are Hubbard (page 202), McComiskey (page 200), Dearman (pages 299–302), and Stuart (page 190).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Lord also has a <u>covenant lawsuit</u> against Judah (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">But this verse may refer to an informal accusation. If possible, use a general expression that could be understood as either a formal or an informal accusation.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some who say that it may not describe a lawsuit or court case are Garrett (page 236) and Davies (page 272).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Lord has an <u>accusation</u> to bring against the people of Judah (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>12:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He will punish Jacob according to his ways</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and he will punish Jacob for the evil he has done.</p></li><li><p>He will fairly judge <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all the descendants of</span> Jacob for their crimes.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He will punish Jacob according to his ways:</strong> This clause means that the LORD will punish Jacob fairly. The expression <em>punish…according to his ways</em> indicates the degree or extent of punishment. The punishment will be exactly what people deserve. It will not be too much or too little. The expression <em>his ways</em> refers to his sinful conduct. Here are some other ways to translate this expression:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he will punish Jacob as his conduct merits (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He is about to punish Jacob for all his deceitful ways (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>punishes Jacob because of the way their people act (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Jacob:</strong> Jacob is the ancestor of the people of Israel and Judah. But here Jacob is a figure of speech (metonymy) in which the name represents all his descendants. Some versions make this meaning explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the descendants of Jacob (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>12:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and repay him according to his deeds.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He will give back to him exactly what he deserves.</p></li><li><p>He will pay them back based on what their deeds deserve.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and repay him according to his deeds:</strong> The meaning of this line is very similar to 2b. The Hebrew word for <em>repay</em> means “to give back.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT (electronic edition, page 1432) 4b.</span></span> Here the word <em>deeds</em> refers to wicked actions.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Hubbard (page 202).</span></span> This line describes the LORD’s punishment of the people of Israel. As in the previous line, the expression <em>according to his deeds</em> means that the extent of the LORD’s punishment will be exactly what the descendants of Jacob deserve. Here are some other ways to translate this line:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he will give them what they deserve (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he will repay him as his deeds deserve (NJB)</p></blockquote>",

See also Garrett (pages 238–241). Dearman (pages 304–305) agrees that a chiasm is possible. Andersen and Freedman (pages 608–614) agree that 12:4b may refer to Jacob and Esau. This view parallels the account of Jacob and Esau in Genesis 33:4–10.

It can mean “he took by the heel.” It can also mean “he attacked/supplanted.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT (#1676) gives the literal meaning as “take by the heel” and the figurative meaning as “supplant.” In Genesis 27:36, Esau makes the second meaning explicit.

There is no evidence of an error in the MT.

Most versions and commentaries regard them as collective singular pronouns that refer to the people of Israel in Hosea’s time. The Display will use “you/your” plural, referring to the people.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you must return to your God:</strong> In Hebrew, this command is more literally “in your God you will return.” There are two main interpretations of this command:<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In Hebrew, the verb “return” has imperfect form here.

BDB cites this verse as meaning “to return (and rest) in thy God.” Similarly, Keil (page 97) suggests the meaning: “turn as to enter into vital fellowship with God.”</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You must return to your God (GW) <em>(BSB, CEV, GNT, GW, KJV, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, NJPS, NLT, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>God will help them return.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT (electronic edition, page 105) 16b describes this use as: “introduces the means or the instrument.” It does not mention Hosea 12:6 specifically.

The phrase “days of old” may follow the Targum that translates the word similarly.

During the time of the celebration, the people lived in temporary shelters. It reminded the people of the time when their ancestors lived in tents in the wilderness, after he brought them out of Egypt. See Leviticus 23:42–43. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as in the days of the appointed feast (ESV) <em>(BSB, ESV, GW, KJV, NASB, NIV, NLT, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Hebrew word refers to the Tabernacle/Tent of Meeting.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Andersen and Freedman (page 618), Hubbard (page 208), and Macintosh (page 499)</span></span> The Tabernacle is the tent in which the LORD was present with the people after he brought them out of Egypt. It was also the place where they came to worship him at that time. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I shall make you live in tents yet again, as in the days of the Tent of Meeting. (REB) <em>Some versions imply the tent of meeting using different words. For example:</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will make you live in tents again, as you did when I came to you in the desert. (GNT) <em>(GNT, NCV,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NJB has “days of meeting” and NCV has “worship days.” These may refer to worship in the tabernacle.</span></span> NJB, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). It has the majority support of modern versions as well as from the LXX and the Peshitta. Interpretation (2), however, is also acceptable. Both interpretations refer to the time of exodus. Interpretation (1) does so indirectly, by comparing living in tents to the Feast of Booths. That Feast, in turn, reminds them of the time of the exodus. Interpretation (2) directly compares living in tents to the time of the exodus.</p>",

Hosea continues to describe Israel, giving examples from the life of their ancestor Jacob to show that Israel followed his bad behavior (12:2–8). The LORD then reminded the people how they had responded wickedly when he led them in the past (12:9–11).

Another example is the repetition of a word root, such as <em>awn</em>, which has three separate meanings in chapter 12: “manhood/virility” in 12:4, “wealth” in 12:9, and “wickedness” in 12:11.

However, in Hebrew a noun can occur instead of an adjective to give a degree of emphasis to it. McComiskey (page 209).</span></span> Here are some acceptable ways to translate the clauses:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question followed by a response. The implied answer in the response is “yes.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Is there iniquity in Gilead? Surely they are worthless.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The people of Gilead are evil, worth nothing.

It is likely that Hosea’s use of the word here had a broader sense. Hosea uses the same word to refer to the people of Gilead in 6:8. There the word is associated with bloodshed, not specifically with idolatry.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Gilead:</strong> Gilead is the region in the northern kingdom of Israel located east of the river Jordan. The region includes land and cities belonging to the tribes of Reuben, Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>It is also possible that Hosea had in mind the city of Ramoth-Gilead or Jabesh-Gilead.</span></span> By the time of Hosea, Gilead was known to be a place of evil.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>They will surely come to nothing:</strong> The Hebrew word for <em>nothing</em> here means “emptiness,” “vanity,” “falsehood.” It designates something that is worthless either physically or morally.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT (#2338a). Garrett (pages 244–245) suggest that without Yahweh they are nothing, a non-people.</span></span> In Hebrew, the preceding word <em>surely</em> emphasizes how worthless the people were.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are two main interpretations of the time reference of this clause:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The people of Gilead <u>were worthless at that time</u>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The verb phrase, literally “surely worthlessness they are” is in the perfect tense/aspect, which normally indicates a completed state.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They are worthless (GW) <em>(GW, KJV, NASB, NCV, NIV, NJB, NJPS, NLT, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The people of Gilead <u>will become worthless in the future</u>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Keil (pages 98–99) and some others propose that here the perfect verb form indicates the certainty of a future state.</span></span> They will be destroyed. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they shall surely come to nothing (ESV) <em>(BSB, CEV, ESV, GNT, NET, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with the majority of versions.

There is no separate word for <em>anger</em>. Some versions leave the idea of <em>anger</em> implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Ephraim gave bitter provocation (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Other versions make it make it explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Ephraim bitterly provoked him to anger (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural to focus on the LORD’s anger caused by Ephraim’s provocation.

Nothing in the preceding context hints at such an emotional response. Pusey (page 124) points out that the literal “with bitternesses” indicates that they provoked the LORD “with the most heinous sins, such as are most grievously displeasing to God.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The plural form indicates intensity. It implies “very bitterly provoked to anger.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A noun that functions as an adverbial accusative. HALOT (electronic edition, page 1758) and the NET footnote on “bitterly.”</span></span> In Hebrew, the adjective form <em>bitter</em> means “bitter, strong.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT (#1248a).</span></span> Here it probably implies that Ephraim’s bitter provocation caused the LORD to experience a correspondingly bitter or strong anger.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to TWOT (#1016), in the 45 instances of the Hiphil form of “provoke to anger,” a common theme is that God’s covenant people have aroused his wrath by means of their unfaithfulness. NIDOTTE (#4087) also mentions Hosea 12:14 as “one of the earliest examples of divine anger.”</span></span> See the NIV2011 and GNT quoted below.</p><h4>12:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so his Lord will leave his bloodguilt upon him</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>So his Lord/master will hold him accountable for his murders,</p></li><li><p>and he will not forgive them for the blood they have shed.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so his Lord will leave his bloodguilt upon him:</strong> This clause is more literally “and his bloods on him he will leave.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This expression probably means that God holds Ephraim (the people of Israel) accountable for his crimes, particularly the murders he has committed. God will not forgive Ephraim by removing the guilt. Instead, he will leave the guilt on Ephraim. The implication is that Ephraim will be punished accordingly.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This view assumes that the Hebrew word “bloods (pl)” refers here to murders committed by Ephraim. See Keil (page 99), Stuart (pages 195–196), and Hubbard (page 211).</span></span> Compare to 1 Kings 2:32–33.

The BSB and many other versions place it here to conform to natural English. The pronoun <em>his</em> refers to Ephraim.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Hebrew word for <em>Lord</em> here is <em>ʾadon</em>, “lord,”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Literally <em>ʾadonaw</em> “his Lords (plur).” McComiskey (page 211) suggests that the plural ending denotes the plural of majesty. The variation in vocalization distinguishes this use as a sacred name from uses that refer to human beings.</span></span> not Yahweh. Versions indicate this by translating this word as <em>Lord</em>, not as “Lord” or “LORD.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>his bloodguilt:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase is “his bloods.” The plural form of the word “blood” often refers to bloodshed/murders. The word can also indicate bloodguilt/accountability for a murder.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDB (#1818) 1g. Also Andersen and Freedman (pages 622–623), McComiskey (page 211), Davies (page 283), Macintosh (page 515), and Patterson and Hill (page 76).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word can imply crimes so severe that the person who commits them deserves capital punishment.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Stuart (pages 195–196) and Garrett (page 247).</span></span> Some versions make this meaning explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They deserve death for their crimes. (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>12:14c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:14c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and repay him for his contempt.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and he will repay Israel/Ephraim what he deserves for his defiance.</p></li><li><p>He will punish them appropriately for the scorn <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they have shown</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and repay him for his contempt:</strong> The meaning of this clause is similar to 14b. It means to give back to Ephraim an appropriate payment for his contempt. In this context, the Hebrew word for <em>repay</em> means “to pay back” or “requite evil.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>DCH (Vol. 8, page 292) h.</span></span> Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Their Lord will punish them for the disgrace they have brought on him.

The expression “a fool of men” in Prov 15:20 is similar.</span></span> It refers to the people who offer sacrifices to calf-idols. It does not specify what kind of sacrifice they offer.

Commentators suggest the following possible uses of the imperfect here. Imperative: “you must not know” Garrett (page 256–257), Dearman (pages 321–322), Stuart (page 203), and Wood (page 220). Present: “you don’t know” McComiskey (page 216). Frequentative imperfect with an implied prohibition: “you don’t know” Macintosh (page 527). Perfect: “you have not known” Keil (page 101). Pluperfect: “you had not known” Andersen and Freedman (pages 633–634).</span></span></p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>This clause is a command.

See the note in 2:20b, which has the same interpretation. The context here is a close relationship with the LORD in which the people trust him and are faithful to him. To know the LORD also implies having knowledge about his ways, his promises, and his requirements.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>God:</strong> In this clause, the Hebrew word for <em>God</em> is Elohim, not Yahweh.

He must punish them in response.</p></div><h4>13:6–8</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In <u>13:4–5</u>, the LORD <u>speaks to</u> the people of Israel using 2nd person pronouns such as “you” and “your.” In <u>13:6–8</u>, he <u>speaks about</u> the people of Israel using 3rd person pronouns such as “they” and “them.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some versions, such as the GNT, translate these verses with 2nd person pronouns instead of 3rd person. Translate these pronouns in a natural way in your language.</p><h4>13:6a–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the three poetic lines:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6a</sup>When they had pasture, they became satisfied;</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6b</sup>when they were satisfied, their hearts became proud,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6c</sup>and as a result they forgot Me.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">These lines describe three stages of Israel’s changing attitude toward the LORD. In Deut 8:11–14 the same three stages are described. Both passages have the same Hebrew words for “satisfied,” “proud,” and “forget.” It is recommended that you translate these Hebrew words in a similar way in both places.</p><h4>13:6a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"13:6a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>When they had pasture, they became satisfied;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They had plenty to eat, and they were satisfied.</p></li><li><p>They were content because of the abundance of food they had.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>When they had pasture, they became satisfied:</strong> There are two main textual options in the first part of this clause (a single word in Hebrew):</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Masoretic Text is more literally “according to their pasturage.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HOTTP gives this option a rating of “B: some doubt.”</span></span> With this option, the clause focuses on the relationship between eating/grazing and being satisfied. The source of the food is left implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As they had their pasture, they became satisfied (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but when they had grazed, they became full (ESV) <em>(BSB, ESV, GNT,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The GNT has been listed here, because its rendering “But when you entered the good land,…” probably implies a land with good pasture.</span></span> KJV, NASB, NCV, NET, NJPS, NLT, REB, RSV )</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Some scholars think that the original text was “as/when I pastured them.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In this option, the Hebrew word must be divided differently and have different vowels than the MT word. The MT has <em>kǝmarʿitam</em>, “according to their pasturage.” The suggestion is to analyze the comparative <em>kǝ</em> as <em>kǝmo</em> “thus/as.” Also the noun + suffix, <em>marʿitam</em> “their pasturage” is analyzed instead as the verb + suffix, <em>rǝʿitim</em> “I pasture/feed them.”</span></span> With this option, the relationship between eating/grazing and being satisfied is similar. “I” (the LORD) is explicitly stated as the source of the food. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I gave them food, and they became full and satisfied. (NCV) <em>(CEV, GW, NAB, NCV, NIV, NJB, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The Display will follow option (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This option is supported by the LXX and Vulgate, Macintosh (pages 530–531), Davies (page 290), and McComiskey (page 216).</span></span> However, option (2) is also well supported by versions and commentaries.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This option is supported by the Peshitta and Targum. In addition, Macintosh (page 531) speaks of “Yahweh’s pasturing of Israel.” Hubbard says that “ ‘when I fed them’ makes better sense than ‘according to their pasture.’ ” Wood (page 220) says that “God’s care for his people involved his feeding them.”</span></span> With both options, the result of available pasturage (food) is that the people are satisfied. Even with option (1), the historical context of Israel’s time in the wilderness along with the context of 13:3 strongly implies that it was the LORD who supplied them with their food.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>had pasture:</strong> The Hebrew word for <em>had pasture</em> is more literally “pasturage.” It usually refers to the grass or other vegetation that domestic animals eat.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT (#2185c).</span></span> Here the word is probably figurative. It may refer particularly to manna that the LORD provided for his people in the desert of Sinai.

But instead of being thankful to him, they became proud.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may not be natural to include the phrase <em>when they were satisfied</em> in both 6a and 6b. Some versions leave this phrase implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and then you grew proud (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>hearts became proud:</strong> In Hebrew, the phrase <em>hearts became proud</em> is more literally “and their heart was lifted up.” This expression means they were proud/arrogant.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT (#2133) says “The high heart represents presumption (Deuteronomy 8:14) or pride (Ezekiel 31:10).”</span></span> Here it indicates that the people did not acknowledge the LORD.

It refers to what will soon occur.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A future time reference is suggested by the parallel imperfect verbs in the series of similes, “I-will-lurk,” “I-will-attack,” “I-will-devour,” “will tear apart.” McComiskey (page 217) suggests that the function of the waw consecutive here is primarily to connote logical consequence. God becoming a lion is the logical consequence of the people forgetting him. The NET footnote for this word agrees. The future sense of the verbs that follow this one indicate that the activity of God is pending. The BART interlinear cites Waltke and O’Connor chap 33.1.2.f, calling this a ‘specific future.’ A future sense is also supported by the LXX and the Vulgate.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So I will become like a lion to them (NRSV) <em>(BSB, CEV, GNT, GW, KJV, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, NJB, NLT, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to what has begun to occur and is ongoing in Hosea’s time.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The waw consecutive form is the standard way Biblical Hebrew indicates a past event in a story line. Keil (page 102) states that the word is the preterite that gives the consequence of forgetting God. The punishment has already begun and will continue in the future. Macintosh (page 532) agrees with rabbinical scholar ibn Ezra, who suggests that the waw consecutive [past] indicates the evils which have [already] befallen Israel. Davies (page 290) cites the NJPS “I am become” as a past event and suggests that the imperfect verbs that follow it might be meant as iterative present tenses, “I lurk,” “I attack them and rip open…”</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So I am to them like a lion (ESV) <em>(ESV, NJPS)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions.

The specific behavior of a lion is left implied.

It has sharp teeth and long claws. If bears are not known in your language area, it is suggested that you provide a picture or describe it in a footnote. You may also use a more general phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a fierce/angry wild animal</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will attack them, and I will tear open their chests:</strong> The attack is ferocious. It does more than injure. It kills.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Stuart (page 204).</span></span> Be sure that you translate in a way that does not make the attack sound less severe.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>tear open their chests:</strong> This phrase is more literally “and I will tear the enclosure of their heart.” The Hebrew word for “enclosure of their heart” refers to the breast or the rib-cage.</p><h4>13:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"13:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>There I will devour them like a lion,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Like a lion I will devour them quickly</p></li><li><p>I will eat them there as if I were a lion.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>There I will devour them like a lion:</strong> The lion<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Hebrew has a different word for lion here than in 13:7a.

The word has no explicit referent. It may refer to the time and be translated as “then” or “immediately.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Like a lion I will devour you on the spot (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, <em>There</em> might refer back to the path in 7b. Most versions that include the word “there” leave the referent unstated. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will devour them there like a lion (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>devour:</strong> In this figure of speech, the lion devours/eats those it attacks. A common figurative meaning of devour is to destroy.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT (#85). “Figuratively, droughts, famines, and pestilences are said to consume, meaning that they overcome.

One interpretation is that this line further describes the lion or the previous animals. Macintosh (page 533) describes this interpretation more technically as a circumstantial clause, “while/as if wild beasts rip them in pieces.” A second possible interpretation regards this clause as a separate metaphor in which the LORD is compared to an unspecified wild animal. This interpretation assumes that the Hebrew comparative <em>ki</em> is implied here. See Dearman (pages 323–324). It is difficult to be certain which of these two interpretations each cited version is following. Either one is acceptable.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Like a wild animal I will tear you apart. (GW) <em>(BSB, CEV, GNT, GW, ESV, NASB, NET, NCV, NJB, NLT, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>This clause describes the behavior of wild animals.

This interpretation continues the pattern of figurative descriptions in each line.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a wild beast:</strong> This phrase is more literally “animal of the field.” Here this phrase refers to wild animals that attack human beings or damage land.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NIDOTTE (#2651).</span></span> It is singular, but it may also be understood as collective singular.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Macintosh (page 534).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, the natural way to translate collective singular is by using plural.

According to TWOT (#144) this word is a particle that often occurs in sentences containing a question, command, or wish.</span></span> Some versions leave it implied.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to save you:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase is more literally “so that he may save you.” It expresses a wish or intention to save them.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Heb verb <em>wǝyošiʿaka</em> “so that he may save you” looks like a waw consecutive. However, a waw consecutive would make no sense here. Macintosh (page 537) describes it as a simple waw with a jussive that has voluntative or potential force. Accordingly, the waw is understood here as “so that” rather than a simple “and.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in all your cities:</strong> There is a textual issue concerning the phrase <em>in all your cities</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Masoretic Text has <em>in all your cities</em>. This phrase describes the populated locations in Israel where an enemy attack is most likely to occur.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Macintosh (page 538) and Stuart (page 205).</span></span>For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Where now is your king, to save you in all your cities? (ESV) <em>(BSB, ESV, GW, KJV, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, NJB, NJPS, NLT, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Some scholars think that the original text has “to defend you.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Macintosh (page 537) notes that some commentators have questioned the MT reading because it restricts the king’s help just to cities, so they have emended the text in various ways.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Where are all your princes, to defend you… (RSV) <em>(RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1). It requires no changes to the Hebrew text.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There is another interpretation issue concerning the phrase <em>in all your cities</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The phrase <em>in all your cities</em> describes where the king should save people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Where now is your king, that he may save you in all your cities (NASB) <em>(BSB, ESV, NAB, NASB, NCV, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The phrase <em>in all your cities</em> describes where the rulers are located.

Where in all your cities are your rulers (NRSV) <em>(GW, NIV, NJB, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). It best follows the syntax of the Masoretic Text.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The MT text has: “where [is] your king then that he may save you in all your cities and your rulers….” Grammatically, the phrase, “in all your cities” is part of the first clause.

It was necessary to judge them because they continued to rebel against him.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Final Judgment on Israel (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lord’s Relentless Judgment on Israel (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Ephraim’s Idolatry (NASB)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1028013012\" data-endVerseId=\"1028013016\"><h3>Paragraph 13:12–16</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, the LORD expresses his anger against Israel and describes his coming judgment. He compares Israel’s situation to a painful childbirth and to a child who resists being born (13:13). He describes his coming judgment figuratively as a taunt to the grave (Sheol) and death to come and destroy (13:14) and as a desert wind that dries up springs and fountains (13:15). He also describes it nonfiguratively by citing horrible acts of war (13:16).</p></div><h4>13:14a–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the parallel lines that are similar in meaning:<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Notice the poetic chiasmic structure: 14a grave, 14b death, 14c death, 14d grave.</span></span></p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>14a</sup>I will <u>ransom</u> them from the power of <strong>Sheol</strong>;</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>14b</sup>I will <u>redeem</u> them from <strong>Death</strong>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>14c</sup>Where, O <strong>Death</strong>, are your <strong>plagues</strong>?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>14d</sup>Where, O <strong>Sheol</strong>, is your <strong>sting</strong>?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">There are two main interpretations of these four clauses:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The first two clauses are rhetorical questions. The implied answer is “No.” The LORD indicates by means of these rhetorical questions that he will punish Israel. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Shall I ransom them from the power of Sheol? Shall I redeem them from Death? (NRSV) <em>The second two clauses are also rhetorical questions. The LORD taunts death, implying, “Where is the destruction that you should bring to Israel?<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Dearman (pages 328–329), Stuart (page 207), Davies (page 295), Macintosh (page 546), and Hubbard (page 221).</span></span> For example:</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>O Death, where are your plagues? O Sheol, where is your destruction? (NRSV) <em>(CEV, GNT, NAB, NASB, NCV, NET, NJB, NLT, NRSV, REB).</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The first two clauses are statements. The LORD promises to save the people of Israel. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I shall ransom them from the power of Sheol; I shall redeem them from Death. (ESV) <em>The second two clauses are rhetorical questions. In light of the LORD’s preceding promise to save Israel, he here mocks death because it can no longer destroy.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Andersen and Freedman (pages 639–640), Keil (pages 104–105), McComiskey (pages 223–224), and Wood (page 221).</span></span> For example:</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>O Death, where are your plagues? O Sheol, where is your sting?<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In more literal versions, such as the NRSV and the ESV, the surface structure of the second set of rhetorical questions is the same in both interpretations. The meaning of 14a–b determines whether the message of the two questions here is bad/threatening or good/encouraging for the people of Israel.</span></span> (ESV) <em>(BSB, ESV, GW,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The GW has statements for all four clauses. Unlike other versions that use statements, it uses the phrases “I want to…” It has been listed here, because it clearly supports the overall meaning of interpretation (2).</span></span> KJV, NIV, NJPS)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with a majority of versions and commentaries. It best fits the context of judgment in the surrounding verses.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Both the LXX and Syriac follow interpretation (2). However, many scholars hold that a promise of rescue here is out of place in the context of this whole paragraph that focuses on judgment. In addition, ch.12 and the first part of ch. 13 all deal with Israel’s terrible sins and the LORD’s determination to punish them. However, it should be noted that ch. 6:1–3 and ch. 14 both contain promises that the LORD will forgive the people and restore their nation. It is clear from 1 Corinthians 15:55 that the Apostle Paul either reads this verse in a positive light as do the early versions, or else in rabbinic fashion he reframes the original declaration of judgment into a proclamation of victory over death in light of Christ’s resurrection. See Dearman (pages 328–329). Calvin (pages 478–479) points out that the apostles sometimes focused on a single word or concept in a quoted passage rather than then conveying the entire thought. Here, Paul probably alluded indirectly to this Hosea text because of his desire to praise “the incredible power of God.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some versions translate in a way that makes the implied meanings more explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Will I deliver them from the power of Sheol? <u>No, I will not!</u> Will I redeem them from death? <u>No, I will not!</u> O Death, <u>bring on</u> your plagues! O Sheol, <u>bring on</u> your destruction! (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Should I, the Lord, rescue you from death and the grave? <u>No!</u> <u>I call</u> death and the grave to strike you like a plague. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The GNT translates the rhetorical questions in the first two clauses as statements:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will not save this people from the world of the dead or rescue them from the power of death. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">This may be a good translation option if a rhetorical question is not natural or effective in your language.</p><h4>13:14a–b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"13:14a–b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(combined/reordered)</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I will not save this people from the world of the dead or rescue them from the power of death.

Will I rescue them from death? (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>power of Sheol:</strong> The Hebrew phrase is more literally “hand of Sheol.” In Hebrew a common figurative meaning of “hand” is <em>power</em> or strength.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT (#844).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word Sheol can refer to “place of the dead” or just “death.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>McComiskey (pages 223–224).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the power of Sheol (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the place of the dead (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions leave the word <em>power</em> implied.

It is used as part of a taunt. See interpretation (1) above. Some versions translate the taunt in a different way. For example, the NLT translates the rhetorical questions as commands:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>O death, bring on your terrors! O grave, bring on your plagues! (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>plagues:</strong> The Hebrew word means any kind of disease that causes death.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDB (#1698) and TWOT (#399b). The NASB has “thorns” here. “Thorns” is a second possible meaning of the word according to HALOT (electronic edition, page 212) sense II and NIDOTTE (#1823). However, only a small minority of versions follow it.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>sting:</strong> There are two main interpretations of the meaning of the Hebrew word:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “destruction.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>O Sheol, where is your destruction? (NRSV) <em>(GNT, GW, KJV, NET, NIV, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <em>sting</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>O Sheol, where is your sting? (ESV) <em>(BSB, ESV, NAB, NASB, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). The most common meaning of the Hebrew word is “destruction.” It has good support from the majority of versions and scholars.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDB (#6986) and TWOT (#2007a) give “destruction” as the meaning of the Hebrew word. There is also some support for the meaning “sting.” The LXX and Syriac have “sting.” HALOT (electronic edition, page 1092) sense 3 and NIDOTTE (#7776) list “sting” as one sense of the word.</span></span> However, both interpretations have good version support, so it is recommended that you give the other option in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This is what the Masoretic Text probably means. Some ancient and modern versions have “sting” here.</p></blockquote><h4>13:14e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"13:14e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Compassion is hidden from My eyes.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I will not have compassion <span data-bnType=\"implied\">on them</span>.</p></li><li><p>I refuse to pity <span data-bnType=\"implied\">these people</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Compassion is hidden from My eyes:</strong> The Hebrew word translated as <em>Compassion</em> is found only here in the Old Testament and the meaning is debated.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example, HALOT (electronic edition, page 689) gives the meaning as “compassion.” BDB (#5164) gives the meaning as “sorrow,” “repentance.”</span></span> There are two main interpretations of this line:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The LORD will not show compassion.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This interpretation is favored by Davies (page 296), Macintosh (pages 548–549), and Wood (page 221).

These are the two main options:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Masoretic Text has <em>brothers</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Though Ephraim may flourish among his brothers (NABRE) <em>(BSB, CEV, ESV, GW, KJV, NABRE, NCV, NIV, NJB, NLT, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Some scholars think that the original word was “reeds.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Scholars suggest that the MT substituted the word <em>ʾaḥ</em> “brother” for the word <em>ʾaḥu</em> “marsh plant, reed plant.” BDB (#269).

They leave the comparison to the Assyrian armies implied. It is recommended that you translate in a similar way if possible.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, it may be confusing or unnatural in some languages to use this figure of speech. If that is true in your language, here are some other ways to translate this figure of speech:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Change the figure of speech to a simile.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>15b</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the enemy will destroy like</span> an east wind <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that</span> will come—a wind from the LORD</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>15c</sup>rising up from the desert.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>15b</sup>The LORD will send the enemy. They will come from the east,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>15c</sup>moving swiftly from the wilderness.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a different figure of speech with the same meaning that is natural in your language.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">The <em>east wind</em> figure of speech continues in 15d–f. If you make a change in 15b–c you may need to make changes to 15d–f to concord with it. For example, if in 15b–c you translate the meaning without the figure of speech, you may need to translate 15d–f without the figure of speech there as well.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>desert:</strong> This word refers to dry and barren land where very few people live.

The LXX, Peshitta, and the Vulgate, however, translate the word as “dry up” NIDOTTE (#3312). It is possible that these early versions based their translations on a different Hebrew word root. It is one that also occurs in a Qumran text. Modern versions follow the early versions here.

This translation option continues the east wind figure of speech from 15a. The east wind represents the Armies of Assyria, who plunder.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>However, the Lord’s scorching wind will come from the east…. <u>The wind</u> will destroy every precious thing in their storehouses.

(NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Say that the enemy plunders.

(REB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Leave the agent of plundering implied.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Davies (page 296) suggests that “the east wind” need not be the grammatical subject of “plunder” here. The verb may have an indefinite subject equivalent to passive. In this translation option, the fact that Ephraim will be plundered is what matters. The identity of the plunderer is not important.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Every precious thing they own will be plundered and carried away. (NLT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>treasury:</strong> There are two main interpretations of the Hebrew word for <em>treasury</em> in this context:<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT (#154a) has “treasure,” “treasury,” “storehouse.&quot;</span></span></p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The word means <em>treasury</em>.

Here, however, Hosea told them to take an offering of their words instead of an animal.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The words they should offer are the words that Hosea tells them to say to the LORD in the rest of this verse and in 14:3.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Dearman (pages 337–338), Garrett (pages 270–271), Keil (pages 106–107), Stuart (page 213), Carroll (page 301), Hubbard (page 227), McComiskey (page 229), Macintosh (page 563) and Wood (page 223).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions make clearer what words Hosea refers to here.

The word “every” goes with “iniquity” but it is interrupted by the verb “forgive.” The two main explanations for this odd syntax are: 1) This is a broken construct chain. This suggestion is probably correct, as similar examples occur elsewhere. For example, Hosea 6:9 has: “[the] way they murder to Shechem” in which the construct chain “the way to Shechem” is interrupted by the verb “they murder.” See Andersen and Freedman (page 645), McComiskey (page 229) and Davies (page 302). 2) The word “every” is meant as the adverb “wholly” as in “wholly forgive.” See the NET footnote on “Completely” for 14:2. This option has less support. Davies (page 302) and Macintosh (page 561) discuss this option but it is not clear that either one favors it.</span></span> The word <em>Forgive</em> means to “take away guilt.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDB (#4984) 3c.</span></span> For information on the word <em>guilt</em> see the note in Hosea 13:12 on “guilt…sins.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Take away all iniquity (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Forgive all our sins (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>And accept what is good:</strong> There is a textual issue regarding the Hebrew word that the NJPS translates as <em>what is good</em>.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Hebrew word is: <em>good</em>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDB (#2895) III 2.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>accept what is good (ESV) <em>(CEV,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The CEV makes explicit that their praise is what is good. The CEV has “Accept our good sacrifices of praise….”</span></span> ESV, NAB, NJPS, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Hebrew word is: “word/speech.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT (electronic edition, page 372) IV. The LXX has “speak to him,” a verbal form of this word. Some scholars question if “word/speech” is a true sense of the Hebrew word. <em>ṭôb</em>. Macintosh (page 562) says that even though the word “good” can imply words, it is not certain that the Hebrew word itself can actually mean “word, speech.” The cited versions translate “word/speech” as “prayer.”</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>accept our prayer (GNT) <em>(GNT, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Hebrew word is: “graciously.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This option has a different subject and object than options (1) and (2). Instead of the people giving an offering to God, God offers graciousness to the people. The justification for this option is unknown. According to Davies (page 302) the root that underlies the option is TWOT (#793b) <em>ṭûb</em> “goodness, graciousness.” This option requires a different form of the Hebrew word in the MT.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and graciously receive us (NLT) <em>(BSB, GW, KJV, NASB, NCV, NIV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1). It has the best support from lexicons. However, in this context, the phrase <em>what is good</em> refers to words of confession and repentance in prayer. For that reason option (2) is also acceptable.</p><h4>14:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"14:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that we may present the fruit of our lips.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>May we<sup>(excl)</sup> offer as bulls <span data-bnType=\"implied\">these good words from</span> our lips.</p></li><li><p>Then we will offer <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to you</span><sup>(sing)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">praise from</span> our lips <span data-bnType=\"implied\">instead of</span> bulls.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(NJPS) instead of bulls we will pay [the offering of] our lips:</strong> The Hebrew clause is more literally “so that (or: and) we may pay bulls our lips.” There is a textual issue concerning the Hebrew word for <em>bulls</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Hebrew MT has <em>bulls</em>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Hebrew word for “bulls” here is generally understood to be an adverbial accusative, “so that we may pay/offer our lips as bulls.” See Keil (pages 106–107), Carroll (page 301), McComiskey (page 229) and Macintosh (page 563).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Accept our good sacrifices of praise instead of bulls.

It is not recommended that you follow the ESV or the NAB translations of this clause. These translations do not express the logic flow of the verse up to this point. See also Hosea 6:6 and Macintosh (page 563).</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The LXX has “fruit.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Two common ways to explain the LXX translation are: (1) The original Hebrew word was <em>pĕrî</em> “fruit” rather than <em>p̄ārîm</em> “bulls” or (2) the word final “m” in <em>p̄ārîm</em> is an “enclitic m” that marks case or emphasis and is not a plural suffix. See Andersen and Freedman (page 645), Garrett (pages 270–271), Dearman (pages 337–338) and Hubbard (page 227).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>accept that which is good and we will offer the fruit of our lips (NRSV) <em>(BSB, NABRE, NASB, NIV, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1) along with the majority of versions. It is similar to the first part of the verse in which Hosea urges the people to take their words of repentance to the LORD.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are two acceptable ways to understand the connection of this clause to the preceding one:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>This clause explains the phrase “what is good” in the preceding clause<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The clause initial Hebrew connector, <em>waw</em>, means “and/namely” and indicates apposition here.</span></span> The offering of praise from our lips is what is good. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Accept what is good, <u>namely</u> the praise of our lips as equal to an offering of bulls.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>This clause gives the result of what is said in the preceding clause.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The clause initial Hebrew connector, <em>waw</em>, means “so that” and introduces a result here.</span></span> God’s acceptance of our prayer of repentance allows us to offer praise as a result. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Accept our penitential prayer, <u>that</u> we may offer the praise of our lips as sacrificial bulls. (NET)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we will pay [the offering of] our lips:</strong> Here the Hebrew word for <em>pay</em> means to make a payment to fulfill a vow.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDB (#7999) 4. “make good, i.e. pay, vows.” See also Keil (pages 106–107) and Dearman (pages 337–338).</span></span> The words <em>the offering of</em> are not in the Hebrew text but they are implied by the reference to bulls.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we may <u>offer</u> you the sacrifice of praise (NLT96)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we will <u>dedicate</u> to you our lips.

In Hosea 14:4–7, the LORD gives his response to the people’s prayer of repentance in the form of a poem. In 14:8, he reminds the people that he will not tolerate idols. He also promises to care for the people and bless them. Here are other examples of section headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lord Promises to Forgive (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lord Promises New Life for Israel (NJB)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1028014004\" data-endVerseId=\"1028014007\"><h3>Paragraph 14:4–7</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">This paragraph is a poem with thirteen lines.

In 14:4, the LORD gives his response to Israel’s prayer in direct, nonfigurative words. He promises them healing, love and forgiveness.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In 14:5–7, the LORD describes aspects of his healing, love and forgiveness more fully. Each line in this part of the poem is a figure of speech (simile or metaphor) that compares the LORD or Israel to something from nature that was familiar to people in that part of the world.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Verses 5–7 each end with the name “Lebanon.” “Lebanon” refers to the mountainous area of northern Galilee and modern-day Lebanon.

Some versions imply <em>return</em> by the phrase “dwell <u>again</u>.” The word <em>dwell</em> functions as a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>People will reside again in his shade (NET) <em>(BSB, ESV, GNT, GW, NAB, NCV, NET, NIV, NJB, NLT, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Masoretic Text has “they will return [those who] dwell in its/his shade.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This option regards the word “dwell” to be a participial noun.

The word <em>dwell</em> functions as the participial noun “dwellers.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They that dwell under his shadow shall return (KJV) <em>(KJV, NJPS<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NJPS has “They who sit in his shade shall be revived.” It translates the Hebrew verb “return” as “be revived.” It is an unusual translation of “return” that lacks support from commentaries and other versions.</span></span>)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1) along with most versions.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The vast majority of versions more closely resemble the LXX/Peshitta than the Masoretic Text for this clause.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are two main interpretations of the word that the BSB translates as <em>return</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The word means “again.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT (electronic edition, page 1430) 5. followed by a second verb: “to do again, be again.” Here the word is interpreted to be an auxiliary verb followed by the main verb, “dwell.” This view is preferred by Carroll (page 303). Davies (page 307) also mentions the NIV (“dwell again”) as an alternate translation.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Again they shall dwell in his shade (NAB) <em>(GNT, GW, NAB, NCV, NET, NIV, NLT, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The word means <em>return</em>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT (electronic edition, page 1429) 1. “to turn back, return.” This may refer to the future return of the exiles to Israel. This view is preferred by Davies (page 307), McComiskey (page 233), Stuart (page 216), and Garrett (pages 275–278) (who cites rabbinic scholar ibn Ezra).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They shall return and dwell beneath my shadow (ESV) <em>(BSB, ESV, NJB, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">You may follow either interpretation. Interpretation (1) is supported by most versions. Interpretation (2) is supported by more commentaries. Each interpretation implies the other one. The Display will follow interpretation (1) but will include <em>return</em> in the 2nd ML as implied information.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>dwell:</strong> This word means to inhabit or reside somewhere. Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>live (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>reside (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in his shade:</strong> There is a textual issue in this phrase regarding the referent of the pronoun <em>his</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The pronoun refers to “Israel.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Keil (page 108), Andersen and Freedman (page 647), Garrett (pages 275–278), Dearman (page 342), Davies (page 307), and Wood (page 224).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>People will reside again in <u>his</u> shade.

For example, the LORD may refer to himself in the third person, as “his.” Or if Hosea is now the speaker, then “his” could refer to God. This interpretation is followed by many modern versions. However, it has weak support. The MT, the LXX, and the Peshitta all have “his.” A main objection to this interpretation is that it goes against the context of the plant similes in 14:5–7 that describe the nation of Israel. Garrett (pages 275–278), Stuart (page 216), Macintosh (page 573) and Dearman (page 342) speak against this interpretation.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My people will again live under <u>my</u> shade.

It has good support from commentaries as well as the LXX and the Peshitta. Verses 5 and 6 describe the nation of Israel figuratively as a cedar tree.

A difficulty is that the Hebrew text does not explicitly indicate comparison here. This interpretation requires significant changes to the syntax of the line. It changes the grammatical subject/agent from “they” (the people) to an unstated subject (presumably God). It also changes the grammatical object of the Hebrew verb “cause to live” from “grain” to “people.” These changes are not supported by the MT syntax.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They shall flourish like the grain.

In Hosea 14:4–7, the LORD gives his response to the people’s prayer of repentance in the form of a poem. In 14:8, he reminds the people that he will not tolerate idols. He also promises to care for the people and bless them.

Carroll (page 303) argues that suggested changes from first to third person, as in the NJB or NJPS, are “unconvincing” for the reason that Yahweh is the speaker throughout the section.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>O Ephraim, what have I to do with idols? (NRSV) <em>(BSB, ESV, NASB, NET, NIV, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Some scholars think that the original words were “Ephraim what to <u>you</u> again to idols.” This question functions as a command that the LORD gives to Ephraim/Israel. He tells Ephraim to avoid idols.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Patterson and Hill (pages 87–88) quote the NLT in support of option (2).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>O Israel, stay away from idols! (NLT) <em>(CEV, NCV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The LXX has “<u>As for</u> Ephraim—what is there any longer between <u>him</u> and idols?”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Here the noun “Ephraim” is understood to be a casus pendens. See Stuart (pages 216–217). As a casus pendens, the noun “Ephraim” is a fronted subject. It is placed outside the following clause and resumed within the clause by the pronoun “him.” The LXX has “to him” where the MT has “to me.”</span></span> This question functions as indirect speech. The LORD states that Ephraim will avoid idols.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Stuart and Davies. Davies (page 308) says that the LXX rendering yields a stronger contrast with the next line and improves the sense.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The people of Ephraim will have nothing more to do with idols. (GW) <em>(GNT, GW, NJB, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Peshitta has “Ephraim <u>shall say</u>, ‘What have I to do again/any more with idols?’” In this question, Ephraim expresses his own attitude toward idols.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Macintosh (pages 576–577) thinks that the question expresses Ephraim’s attitude. “What need more have I to do with idols?”</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Ephraim [shall say]: “What more have I to do with idols? (NJPS) <em>(KJV, NJPS)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1) along with a majority of versions and commentaries. It makes good sense and does not require changes to the MT.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is a rhetorical question that expects a negative answer. What do I have in common with idols anymore? Nothing! Since the LORD expresses this attitude to Ephraim, it clearly implies that Ephraim also should have nothing to do with idols.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The rhetorical question includes a Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>anymore</em>. In this expression, the Hebrew word means “more” or “further.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>DCH (page 291) 2. Expressing addition “…more, further.”</span></span> A literal translation of this word may incorrectly imply that the LORD had something in common with idols in the past but he will have nothing to do with them in the future.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Garrett (pages 278–279) and McComiskey (page 236).</span></span> However, the LORD never had anything in common with idols.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to avoid the wrong meaning and to translate the rhetorical question. Each bullet gives an example of a question and a statement.</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Make explicit that he had nothing in common with idols in the past. The word “ever” or “never” implies that the same is true in the present and will be true in the future.

Here it is probably to be understood as prophetic perfect. Macintosh (578) and the BART interlinear. Prophetic perfect is translated sometimes with present tense and often with future tense, depending on context. See Seow (page 149) who cites two examples: “We are finished! We are lost! (Num 17:27) or “I shall abandon you” (2 Chron 12:5).</span></span> Many versions translate this clause with present tense. Some versions have future tense.

The BSB translates this word as “respond” in 2:21.</span></span> This word means <em>answer</em> or “respond.” This clause does not say whom the LORD answers. However, this same clause also says “watch over him.” So some versions supply the same pronoun here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will answer <u>him</u> and care for him (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>answer</em> probably implies a response to the needs or the prayers of his people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>McComiskey (page 235) suggests that the word describes God’s response to the needs of his people.</span></span> Some versions make this implication explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I am the one who answers <u>your prayers</u> and cares for you.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>watch over him:</strong> In this clause, the Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>watch over him</em> means “watchful care” or “protecting.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDB (#7788) and TWOT (#2354).

These are Hosea’s final words that refer back to the book of Hosea as a whole. In these chapters, he includes many serious warnings. People who reject the LORD suffer ruin and death as a result. Here those warnings are in view. (See also Hosea 4:5a and 5:5a–c)</p>",
