He was a person who served Yahweh.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>after the death of His servant Moses:</strong> The <em>death of…Moses</em> is described in Deuteronomy 34. The book of Joshua follows that story. This sentence is the opening words of a new book. Think about the natural way to begin a new book in your language. In some languages it may be better to begin with a main clause, for example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Moses had <span data-bnType=\"implied\">recently</span> died</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His servant Moses:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>servant</em> can also be translated as “slave.” It refers to someone who must obey the commands of a master. It is recommended that you use a term that indicates the lowly position of a slave or a servant.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to place Moses’ title <em>His servant</em> after his name, for example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Moses, Yahweh’s servant</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to use the verb “serve” instead of the noun servant, for example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Moses, a man who served Yahweh</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:1a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>After Moses, Yahweh’s servant, died</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Moses had recently died.

If you used a main clause to translate 1:1a you may want to use a temporal phrase here, such as “at that time.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">At that time</span> Yahweh said to Joshua the son of Nun</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the LORD:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates <em>LORD</em> is “Yahweh,” the personal name of God. See the notes in the Introduction on how to translate this term.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Joshua son of Nun:</strong> In some languages it may be more natural to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Joshua whose father was called Nun</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Moses’ assistant:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>assistant</em> comes from a verb that means “to be an attendant on” or “to wait on.” It is different from the Hebrew word translated as “servant” in 1:1a. This word was used when Joshua accompanied Moses up Mount Sinai (Exodus 24:13) where the BSB translated it as “attendant.” Joshua’s task was not that of a servant but of an assistant.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the person who helped Moses</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Moses’ aide (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Moses’ helper (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate this part of the verse:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Yahweh said to Joshua, Nun’s son, who had been Moses’ assistant</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Yahweh spoke to Joshua.

It refers to all the Israelite people, not only to the two spies.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>us:</strong> The pronoun <em>us</em> refers to Rahab and the people of Jericho.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and that we<sup>(excl)</sup> are very afraid of you<sup>(plur)</sup></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Everyone in the country is terrified of you (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>2:9d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that all who dwell in the land are melting in fear of you.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>In fact, all the inhabitants of this land tremble when they see you.</p></li><li><p>All of us in the land are terrified of you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that all who dwell in the land are melting in fear of you:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>melting</em> can also be translated “shake.” This is an idiom which means that the Canaanites were afraid of the Israelites. Many languages have idioms to express the idea of fear. These may be used here and in 2:9c.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in fear of you:</strong> The Hebrew words that the BSB translates as <em>in fear of you</em> indicate that the people of the land were afraid of the Israelites.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Everyone who lives in this country is terrified of you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>All the people of this land shake with fear because of you</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:9c-d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is not natural to use two parallel expressions as the Hebrew text does. If that is true in your language, you could combine these two phrases into one phrase that expresses strong fear, as the GNT does:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Everyone in the country is terrified of you. (GNT)</p></blockquote></div>",

A woman of Jericho called Rahab hid the two men so that the king’s soldiers could not find them. She did this because she believed that Yahweh would help the Israelites conquer their land. The men promised Rahab that if she did not betray them, they would rescue her and her family when the Israelites conquered the town. Rahab helped the men escape from Jericho and they hid in the hills for three days. When the soldiers of Jericho stopped looking for them, they returned to Joshua.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other possible section headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The spies went to Jericho</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The spies and Rahab</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Rahab helped the spies</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1006002008\" data-endVerseId=\"1006002011\"><h3>Paragraph 2:8–11</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Rahab told the spies that the news about the Israelites had made her people afraid.

Use the appropriate connecting word in your language. It may be clearer to supply some implicit information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We</span> <sup>(excl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">are afraid</span> because</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we have heard how the LORD dried up the waters of the Red Sea before you:</strong> The sentence <em>the LORD dried up the waters of the Red Sea before you</em> refers to events described in Exodus 14. In some languages it may be necessary to make explicit why Yahweh dried up the Red Sea, that is, so that the Israelites could cross it. If it is necessary to make this explicit you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we have heard how Yahweh dried up the water of the Red Sea in front of you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so that you could cross it</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Red Sea:</strong> The Hebrew words that the BSB translates as Red Sea are literally “sea of reeds.” The translation <em>Red Sea</em> comes from the Septuagint translation into Greek. This body of water is not the same as what is known as the Red Sea today. If you use the term <em>Red Sea</em>, you should consider adding a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>FOOTNOTE: The Hebrew phrase is literally “Sea of Reeds.” It refers to the lake that the Israelites had to cross when they left Egypt. See Exodus 14.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The term <em>Red Sea</em> occurs several times in Exodus. See, for example, Exodus 10:19.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you:</strong> The Hebrew inflection that the BSB translates as <em>you</em> is plural and refers to the people of Israel.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>when you came out of Egypt:</strong> The whole story of what happened when the Israelites left Egypt is told in Exodus 12–14.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>For we have heard how the Lord made a dry path for you through the Red Sea when you left Egypt (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We are afraid</span> because we heard that Yahweh made the Red Sea dry up in front of you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so that you could cross it</span> when you left Egypt</p></blockquote><h4>2:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amorites across the Jordan, whom you devoted to destruction.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And we have heard what you did to King Sihon and King Og, the two kings of the Amorites who lived on the other side of the Jordan River.

It must be destroyed or given to Yahweh as an offering. In this context it indicates that they killed the two Amorite kings. This event is described in Numbers 21:21–35 and is retold in Deuteronomy 2:24–3:11.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this verb:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>completely destroyed</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>killed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this part of the verse:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We heard what you did when you killed King Sihon and King Og, the two Amorite kings who ruled east of the Jordan River</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We know what you did to Sihon and Og, the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River.

For example, it is used in Genesis 24:27.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>2:14 Woudstra p. 74.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The term <em>kindness</em> translates the Hebrew word <em>ḥesed</em> that was used in verse 2:12 (12b and 12c). You should translate it the same way in each place. The term <em>faithfulness</em> indicates that the two men would be trustworthy in their relationship with Rahab.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you:</strong> The pronoun <em>you</em> is singular. The men referred only to Rahab.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>when the LORD gives us the land:</strong> The clause <em>when the LORD gives us the land</em> refers to the time when Yahweh will help the Israelites to conquer the land of Canaan.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translates this part of the verse:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Then we<sup>(excl)</sup> will act with kindness and faithfulness towards you<sup>(sing)</sup> when Yahweh gives us this land.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We will be loyal and true to you when Yahweh helps us to take over the land.</p></blockquote>",

Here are some other ways to translate these verse part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Take twelve stones out of the middle of the Jordan (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Tell them to get twelve rocks from the middle of the river (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>where the priests were standing,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>from the exact place where the priests’ feet are standing.</p></li><li><p>You must take the rocks from the same place where the priests are standing.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>where the priests were standing:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>where the priests were standing</em> is more literally “the firm standing place of the feet of the priests.” The twelve men picked up the stones while the priests were still standing in the middle of the river.

This was a second monument. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Joshua also set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan (NET) <em>(BSB, NET, RSV, ESV, GW, NAB, NASB, NCV, NJB, NJPS, NLT, REB, GNT, CEV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Joshua set up the twelve stones <u>at their campsite</u>.

Nearly all English versions and most commentaries understand it this way.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is most likely that Joshua had some people build the monument for him.

Verse 4:9 is a parenthetical comment.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>where the priests had stood while carrying the Ark of the Agreement (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It is also possible to leave this phrase implicit if that is more natural in your language.

Now the men and boys who were born after the Israelites left Egypt must be circumcised. Normally, boys were circumcised when they were eight days old.</p>",

In this idiom the rivers flow with milk and honey instead of water. It means that the land was fertile and produced abundant crops. If possible, use vivid language or an idiom which conveys the same meaning in your own language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a very fertile land</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a land which produces lots of crops</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:4–6</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The structure of 5:4–6 is complex. Some English versions reorder these verses. If you find these verses difficult to translate, you might want to consider reordering them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>4b</sup>When the people of Israel left Egypt, <sup>5a</sup>all the males were already circumcised. <sup>6a</sup>However, during the forty years the people spent crossing the desert, <sup>5c</sup>none of the baby boys had been circumcised. <sup>6b</sup>Also, by the end of that time all the men who were of fighting age when they left Egypt had died <sup>6c</sup>because they had disobeyed the Lord. <sup>6d</sup>Just as he had sworn, <sup>6e</sup>they were not allowed to see <sup>6g</sup>the rich and fertile land <sup>6f</sup>that he had promised their ancestors. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">If you follow the GNT, you will need to look at how it translates 5:7. Verse 5:7 includes information that is implied at the beginning of the unit 5:4–6, specifically the statement about why these men had never been circumcised. Verse 5:7 in the GNT reads:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The sons of these men had never been circumcised, and it was this new generation that Joshua circumcised. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">You might also want to consider the CEV, which reorders 5:4–7.</p></div>",

Many commentators believe that this man was an angel. The phrase <em>LORD’s army</em> probably refers to the angels who help fight Yahweh’s battles. This commander came to take charge of the Israelite army. If Joshua and the Israelites obey the commander of Yahweh’s army, then they are also part Yahweh’s army, fighting on God’s side.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I have now come:</strong> The man told Joshua that he had come to Jericho to carry out his duty as the commander of Yahweh’s army. He came to accomplish God’s plan, not Israel’s.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Commander:</strong> A <em>Commander</em> of an army is the person in charge of the army.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>general</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>leader</p></blockquote><h4>5:14c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:14c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Then Joshua fell facedown in reverence</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Then Joshua bowed down and put his face to the ground,</p></li><li><p>Joshua bowed down to the ground <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to show his respect</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Then Joshua fell facedown in reverence:</strong> The expression <em>fell facedown</em> means that Joshua bowed down and touched his forehead on the ground. He did this to show his respect for the leader of Yahweh’s army.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>fell facedown in reverence:</strong> The action of bowing was a form of respect given to people, as well as to God. For example, in Genesis 23:7 Abraham bowed down out of respect to the Hittites, the local inhabitants of Canaan.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is not clear whether the man in 5:13–15 is an angel or is Yahweh himself. You should avoid implying that Joshua worshiped an angel. If necessary you could say that Joshua bowed “with respect” or use the BSB’s <em>in reverence</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Joshua bowed down to the ground to show his respect</p></blockquote><h4>5:14d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:14d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and asked Him, “What does my Lord have to say to His servant?”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and asked: “What command does my master have for me, his servant?”</p></li><li><p>Then Joshua said: “I am your servant, sir.

He did not use the second person pronoun “you.” In Hebrew, this choice of pronoun was a way to show respect. In some languages it may be clearer to use second person forms. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am your servant, sir. What do you want me to do? (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">There may be another grammatical form or particle that shows respect in some languages. Use a form that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>my Lord:</strong> The term <em>my Lord</em> is a term of respect. It is not the word Yahweh. Use a term that shows respect when speaking to a superior.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this term:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>my master</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>my boss</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>have to say to His servant:</strong> The word <em>say</em> here means “command.” Joshua asked the man what he wanted him to do.

In 6:17 Yahweh said that the Israelite soldiers were not to kill Rahab and her family. <u>But</u> they are to destroy all the other things in the town.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>keep away from the things devoted to destruction:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>keep away</em> is an emphatic direct address to the Israelites. It stresses that it is important for the Israelite soldiers to obey Joshua’s (and Yahweh’s) command.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>keep away:</strong> The phrase <em>keep away</em> means that the Israelite soldiers must be careful not to take for themselves the things that belong to Yahweh.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the things devoted to destruction:</strong> The phrase <em>the things devoted to destruction</em> includes the people, animals, and other things in the town that belong to Yahweh. The Israelites must offer these things to Yahweh by destroying them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate 6:18a in a natural way in your language that emphasizes this command. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>It is important</u> that none of you take any of the things that belong to Yahweh</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>But remember!</u> You must be careful not to take for yourselves anything or any person that belongs to Yahweh</p></blockquote><h4>6:18b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:18b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>lest you yourself be set apart for destruction.

See the General Comment at the end of 6:18.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>If you take any of these:</strong> The clause <em>take any of these</em> is the result of coveting.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>these:</strong> The word <em>these</em> refers to things that were mentioned in 6:18a. It may be more natural to refer to them by a pronoun.

This adds emphasis to the defeat of the Israelites. The details specify where and when the Israelite soldiers were killed.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>chasing them:</strong> The word <em>them</em> refers to the Israelite soldiers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>from the gate:</strong> The word <em>from</em> means “in front of.” The men of Ai chased the Israelite soldiers away from the area in front of the town gate all the way to the stone quarries.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the gate:</strong> Ai town (like Jericho town) was surrounded by a town wall. In the wall was a <em>gate</em>, and people could enter the town only through this gate.</p><h4>7:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>as far as the quarries</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and chased them as far as the stone quarries.</p></li><li><p>and down <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the hill</span> to the stone quarries</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as far as the quarries:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>quarries</em>.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>rock quarries</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They chased the Israelites from the city gate as far as the stone quarries (NIV) <em>(BSB, NIV, CEV, GW, NCV, NET, NLT, REB, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is a place named <u>Shebarim</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>pursued them from the town gate as far as Shebarim (NJB) <em>(NJB, RSV, ESV, NASB, NJPS)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Interpretation (2) is a transliteration of the Hebrew word and does not communicate the meaning as it was probably understood in Hebrew.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>quarries:</strong> The word <em>quarries</em> refers to a place where people dig rock from the ground to use in construction.</p><h4>7:5d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:5d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and striking them down on the slopes.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They killed them while they fled down the hill.</p></li><li><p>and killed the Israelites as they ran down the hill.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and:</strong> The Hebrew prefix that the BSB translates as <em>and</em> introduces more details of where and when the Israelite soldiers were killed.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>striking them down:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>striking them down</em> means “killing.” The phrase <em>striking them down</em> refers to the thirty-six Israelite soldiers who were killed. It restates the information in 7:5a. It does not indicate that additional Israelites were killed.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the men of Ai killed them</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>on the slopes:</strong> The phrase <em>on the slopes</em> refers to the hillside going down to the stone quarries.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>on the slope of the hill</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>while they were fleeing down the hill</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 7:5b-d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">This story is told in a way that is common in Hebrew narrative style. It tells a summary of an event first, and then it adds the details. Use the natural grammar of your language to make this clear. Your readers should understand that only thirty-six Israelite people were killed. These are some ways that English versions have handled this style:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The men of Ai killed about thirty-six of them, chasing them from outside the gate as far as Shebarim and killing them on the slope. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The men of Ai chased them from the city gate as far as some quarries and killed about thirty-six of them on the way down the hill.

It means that the people became very afraid. They no longer felt any courage. Many languages have their own idioms to express fear. Here are some English idioms that express this meaning:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And the heart of the troops <u>sank in utter dismay</u>. (NJPS)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they <u>lost their courage</u> (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Israelites were <u>paralyzed with fear</u> at this turn of events, and their <u>courage melted away</u>. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to express the meaning directly without using an idiom. For example, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Israelite soldiers were very afraid</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Express the meaning in the most natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the people:</strong> This phrase refers to the Israelite soldiers.</p>",

There is some implied information here. The Israelite soldiers returned to their camp and told Joshua what happened in the battle. In some languages it may be clearer to make this information explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">When the soldiers returned to camp and reported to</span> Joshua, he tore his clothes</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Joshua:</strong> In the Hebrew text <em>Joshua</em> is mentioned alone as the subject of the sentence. Later in the verse, the elders of Israel also acted along with Joshua. This is a way to emphasize Joshua because he was the leader, and his reaction was the most important.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to include the elders of Israel as part of the subject. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Joshua and the elders of Israel tore their clothes</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>tore his clothes:</strong> The phrase <em>tore his clothes</em> means that Joshua intentionally tore his clothes open. This dramatic action was a way to express grief or sorrow. Joshua ripped open his upper and under garment in front of his chest, as a symbol of the pain in his heart.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>7:6 This dramatic action was an expression of heartfelt grief. TWOT says that he tore both outer and inner garments (p. 816). Holladay’s lexicon defines this word as “to tear, to tear in pieces.” However, Bratcher and Newman says this was “probably only a tear along the edge of the outer garment” (p. 89). This seems unlikely because it is difficult to make a small tear along the edge of a garment with only the bare hands. It is recommended that you translate this as tearing his clothes completely open.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">It may be helpful to make the reason for this action explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>tore their clothes <u>in grief</u> (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>7:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and fell facedown</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He lay face down on the ground</p></li><li><p>He lay down with his face toward the ground</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and fell facedown:</strong> Joshua lay down on the ground with his face downward. The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>fell</em> means that Joshua deliberately lay down on the ground. This was one of the ways that he showed his humility and sorrow.</p><h4>7:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>before the ark of the LORD until evening,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>in front of the ark of Yahweh until evening came.</p></li><li><p>in front of the covenant box of Yahweh until the sun set.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>before:</strong> The word <em>before</em> indicates “in front of” the ark.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the ark of the LORD:</strong> <em>the ark of the LORD</em> was a wooden box that represented the presence of Yahweh among the people. You should use the same word for <em>ark</em> as you did in 3:3.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>until evening:</strong> Joshua lay this way until the sun set.</p><h4>7:6d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:6d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>as did the elders of Israel;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The elders of Israel were with him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">on their faces in front of the ark</span>.</p></li><li><p>Joshua did this with the leaders of Israel.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as did the elders of Israel:</strong> The Hebrew is an ellipsis. In many languages it may be necessary to express it in a different way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he and the elders of Israel <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all did this</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The leaders of Israel <u>did the same thing</u>. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The elders of Israel also did these things along with Joshua.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Hebrew text puts this reference to the elders at an unusual place in the verse. In some languages it may not be natural to keep the order of the Hebrew text. Some English versions include the elders, along with Joshua, as the subject of the sentence in 7:6a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>6a</sup>Joshua and the leaders of Israel tore their clothes in grief (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Express this in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the elders of Israel:</strong> The <em>elders of Israel</em> were older men who were the leaders of Israel.</p><h4>7:6e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:6e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and they all sprinkled dust on their heads.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Joshua and the elders threw dirt onto their heads.</p></li><li><p>They sprinkled dust on their heads.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and they all sprinkled dust on their heads:</strong> It was the custom for people to put dust on their heads to show sorrow. In some languages the reason for this action must be made explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>with dust on their heads <u>to show their sorrow</u> (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sprinkled:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>sprinkled</em> is more literally “to cause to go up.” The precise action that the people used is not clear. Some English versions translate this word as “threw” (REB, NCV, NET). Choose a word that seems natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>dust:</strong> The word <em>dust</em> can also be translated as “dirt.”</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 7:6</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to change the order of some of the information in this verse. There is more than one way to do this. Here are two examples:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6a</sup>Joshua <sup>6d</sup>and the leaders of Israel <sup>6a</sup>tore their clothing in dismay, <sup>6e</sup>threw dust on their heads, <sup>6b</sup>and bowed down <sup>6c</sup>facing the Ark of the Lord until evening. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6a</sup>Then Joshua <sup>6d</sup>and the leaders of Israel <sup>6c</sup>went to Yahweh’s Covenant Box. <sup>6a</sup>They tore their clothes <sup>6e</sup>and put dirt on their heads to show their grief. <sup>6b</sup>Then they threw themselves down <sup>6c</sup>in front of the Covenant Box and lay there with their faces to the ground until sunset.</p></blockquote></div>",

Jacob had twelve sons. The twelve sons became the ancestors of twelve groups of people. All twelve groups in Israel spoke Hebrew. They did not speak twelve different languages. For this reason the word <em>shebet</em> is translated in the display as “clan.” Choose a word in your language that refers to a group of people descended from a common ancestor.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Hebrew word מִשְׁפָּחָה <em>mishpahah</em> that the BSB translates as <em>clan</em> refers to a part of a clan. Each clan had several sub-clans. Each of Jacob’s sons had their own sons, and the sub-clans were named after these grandsons of Jacob. The word <em>mishpahah</em> is translated in the display as “sub-clan.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Hebrew word בַּיִת <em>bet</em> that the BSB translates as <em>family</em> refers to a family or an extended family. The families do not have names.

The exact weight of a shekel was varied, so these weights are approximations. You can translate this using the standard measure of weight used in your country.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and a bar of gold:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>bar</em> is literally “tongue.” The gold was probably in a lump similar in shape to the tongue.

It may be more natural to state this information as an independent sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Joshua built</span> an altar out of stones that had not been cut with an iron tool</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>uncut stones:</strong> The phrase <em>uncut stones</em> can also be translated as “unhewn stones.” It indicates that no one used any tool to chisel the stones or cut them up. An “altar of uncut stones” is mentioned in Exodus 20:25 and in Deuteronomy 27:5.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>no iron tool has been used:</strong> The clause <em>no iron tool has been used</em> indicates that no person used a tool to cut or shape the stones.</p><h4>8:31d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:31d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And on it they offered burnt offerings to the LORD,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>On the altar they offered to Yahweh burnt offerings</p></li><li><p>Then the Israelites made sacrifices that are completely burnt on the altar to Yahweh,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And on it they offered burnt offerings to the LORD:</strong> Probably the priests offered the sacrifices on behalf of the Israelites.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the priests</span> offered burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>burnt offerings:</strong> The phrase <em>burnt offerings</em> refers to animals that were totally burned up as an atonement for sins.

The rest of the animal was eaten by the worshipers.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>8:31 Bratcher and Newman, p. 119.</span></span> Many English versions refer to these offerings as “fellowship offerings.” The person who ate the animal had fellowship with Yahweh.

Look for a natural way to emphasize it in your language. It might be clearer in some languages to translate this as an independent sentence with the subject made explicit: For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But the Israelite leaders did not ask Yahweh what they should do.</p></blockquote>",

Gilgal was where the Gibeonites first met with the Israelites (9:6).</p><h4>10:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Do not abandon your servants.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They said: “Don’t abandon your servants.</p></li><li><p>They pleaded with them: “We are your servants. Don’t throw us away.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In Hebrew this clause begins with the word translated literally as “saying.” It may be more natural in some languages to begin a new sentence here. In this case, the word “saying” may be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They said</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They begged</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They pleaded</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Use words that show the urgency of their request.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Do not abandon your servants:</strong> The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as <em>Do not abandon</em> is a Hebrew idiom. It could be more literally translated “do not let your hand drop.” This idiom indicates that the Gibeonites asked Joshua to protect them from the Amorite kings and their armies. They expected the Israelites to help them because of the peace treaty that they had made with them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your servants:</strong> The phrase <em>your servants</em> is used by the Gibeonites to show their respect for Joshua and the Israelites. Many languages have pronouns or nouns that are used when speaking to superiors. Use whatever is most natural in your language to express this relationship.</p><h4>10:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Come quickly and save us!

We desperately need your help.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Come:</strong> In Hebrew, the word <em>Come </em>is more literally “come up&quot;. The town of Gibeon was higher than the Israelites’ camp at Gilgal. If your language keeps track of elevation, this would be a place to imply going up a steep hill/mountain.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>quickly:</strong> The word <em>quickly</em> indicates the urgency of the Gibeonites’ request. They are in danger and want Joshua and the Israelite army to come at once to fight with them against the Amorite armies.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and save us! Help us:</strong> The two verbs <em>save</em> and <em>Help</em> are very similar in meaning. The Hebrew text uses two verbs with similar meanings to emphasize the urgency of the request. It may be more natural in some languages to express this meaning using one verb and some other means of showing emphasis.</p><h4>10:6d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:6d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because all the kings of the Amorites from the hill country have joined forces against us.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For all the Amorite kings who live in the hill country are attacking us.”</p></li><li><p>The kings of all the Amorite cities in the mountains have gotten together to attack us.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>because</em> introduces the reason for the Gibeonites’ request.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>all the kings of the Amorites from the hill country:</strong> The Gibeonites referred to the five kings that are mentioned in 10:3. There may also have been other kings of smaller towns in the hill country, as 10:28–39 suggests. In addition, the Gibeonites may have exaggerated the facts because they were afraid.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>10:6 Hess, p. 192.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>have joined forces against us:</strong> The clause <em>joined forces against us</em> indicates that the Amorite kings with their armies were preparing to attack the Gibeonites.</p>",

The Hebrew text is clear and it is best to follow it. In verse 10 the Amorite army fled from the Israelites at Gibeon town and followed the road up the mountain slope to Beth-horon town.

Personification gives human characteristics to non-human things for poetic effect. In 12b Joshua spoke to Yahweh. In 12d Joshua spoke to the <em>sun</em>. If the reader does not understand that this is figurative language, it is good to make this clear. One way to clarify this is to include some implicit information:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Joshua asked Yahweh <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to make the sun and the moon stand still.</span> He said, “Sun, stay still at Gibeon. And moon, stay still in the valley of Aijalon.”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>O sun, stand still:</strong> The command <em>sun, stand still</em> may not be natural in some languages. The sun does not have legs and it may not be possible to say that the sun can <em>stand</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Sun, stop moving in the sky</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Sun, stay in one place</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>over Gibeon:</strong> It may be more natural to translate the phrase <em>over Gibeon</em> as “at Gibeon,” or “above Gibeon.” The sun shone in the sky over the town of Gibeon. Use a preposition that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>O moon, over the Valley of Aijalon:</strong> The expression <em>O moon, over the Valley of Aijalon</em> is an example of personification. Personification gives human characteristics to non-human things for poetic effect.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Valley of Aijalon:</strong> The phrase <em>Valley of Aijalon</em> refers to the valley where the town of Aijalon was, seven to ten miles west of Gibeon.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>10:12 Bratcher and Newman, p. 143.</span></span> The Amorites fled from Gibeon as far as Azekah (10:10d). Aijalon was between Gibeon and Azekah.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate 10:12c-d:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Joshua prayed to the Lord in front of all the people of Israel. He said, “Let the sun stand still over Gibeon, and the moon over the valley of Aijalon.” (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In the presence of the people of Israel, Joshua said, “Yahweh, cause the sun to stop moving over Gibeon and cause the moon to stop moving over the valley of Aijalon.”</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 10:12d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In the ancient Near East many people believed that natural objects such as the sun and the moon had a soul or a spirit. The Bible does not teach this. Joshua did not actually speak to the sun or the moon, and he did not expect them to respond to his command. The language Joshua used is a figure of speech called “personification.” Personification gives human characteristics to non-human things. It is used to add emotional impact to the story. As you translate this verse, keep in mind that this response by the sun and moon to Joshua’s command is poetic language. It should not be understood literally.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">A miracle of God’s power took place when he lengthened the day. It was God, responding to the prayer of Joshua, who caused the miracle. The sun and moon did not actually do anything. God made them stand still.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Joshua spoke to both the sun and the moon. Biblical scholars do not agree on why he addressed both the sun and the moon. One possibility is that Joshua prayed this prayer in the early morning when the sun was rising in the east and the moon was setting in the west.</p></div>",

It may be necessary in some languages to make explicit that the Israelite army also fought, and that Joshua did not capture Makkedah by himself. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Joshua and the Israelites captured the town of Makkedah on that day</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Makkedah:</strong> The town of <em>Makkedah</em> was about 40 kilometers southwest of Gibeon.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>10:28 Bratcher and Newman, p. 151.</span></span> The cave where the five Amorite kings hid was near <em>Makkedah</em>.

The word “smote” is the past tense of “smite.” It means “hit.” This idiom means that they killed the king and the people of Makkedah.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this Hebrew idiom:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Joshua killed its king and everyone else in the town (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>10:28c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:28c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He devoted to destruction everyone in the city, leaving no survivors.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He devoted them <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to Yahweh</span> for destruction.

It refers to people or things that are claimed by Yahweh and cannot be bought back by any means. They must be destroyed. If possible, translate this word in the same way as you did in 6:17b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he devoted to destruction every person in it (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>leaving no survivors:</strong> The clause <em>leaving no survivors</em> indicates that not a single person was left alive in the town.</p><h4>10:28d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:28d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He did the same thing to the king of Makkedah that he did to the king of Jericho.</p></li><li><p>He killed the king of Makkedah City in the same way that he killed the king of Jericho City.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho:</strong> The pronoun <em>he</em> refers to Joshua.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They captured Eglon City that same day</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>That day:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>That day</em> is stated twice in this verse for emphasis.

The Hebrew sentence puts the object of the sentence first to emphasize it. Use the sentence order that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>together with their pasturelands:</strong> The phrase <em>together with their pasturelands</em> refers to the land around Hebron where livestock could eat grass.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this part of the verse:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So the people of Israel gave Hebron town with its pasturelands to the descendants of Aaron the priest.
