First, the person who was writing the letter wrote his name: Simon Peter (verse 1a). Then he wrote the name or description of the people receiving the letter (verse 1b). After that, he included a Christian greeting (verse 2).</p></div><h4>1:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ I, Simon Peter, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">am writing this letter.</span> I serve Jesus Christ. And he has sent me to speak on his behalf.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Simon Peter:</strong> It will be clearer to include more information here, like this: “I, Simon Peter, am writing this letter.” Or you could add, “I am writing” in 1:1b. The Greek text and some English versions spell Simon according to the Hebrew spelling: Simeon. But it will be clearer for your readers if you spell Simon in the usual way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Peter described himself as a “servant” (a literal English translation of the Greek is “slave”) and an “apostle” of Jesus Christ. The word “apostle” means a person that someone sends to speak on his behalf. Peter described himself like this in order to remind the people who read his letter that God had given him the right to teach them. Peter was reminding them of this so that they would consider what he would say to be both true and very important, and so that they would obey him when he told them to do things.</p><h4>1:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>To those who through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ have received a faith as precious as ours:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am writing</span> to you<sup>(plur)</sup> who have believed in Jesus Christ in the same way as we<sup>(excl)</sup> have believed in him. Jesus Christ who is our God and also our Saviour is the one who has caused us<sup>(incl)</sup> all to believe in him. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">He has done this</span> because he is just.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>To those who…:</strong> Peter did not write the names of those he was writing to, but it is likely that they were the same group that received his first letter (1 Peter 1:1), because in 3:1 he said that he was now writing to them for the second time. Here Peter simply described the people to whom he was writing as those who trusted in Jesus in the same way that he and the other apostles did.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>righteousness:</strong> This refers to Christ’s goodness and uprightness. All that he does is right, just and fair. So he enables anyone, not only Jews but people of any race, to believe in him and to become part of his own people.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>our God and Savior:</strong> These terms probably both refer to Jesus. That is how most versions interpret this phrase.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>faith:</strong> Most scholars think this refers to the power to believe and trust in Jesus. This is the most likely meaning. But some think that it refers to the teaching that Christians believed, and which Christians had taught to other people who were becoming Christians since the time when the apostles first taught these things (see 3:2b).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as precious as:</strong> The Greek word used here can have two meanings:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“of equal privilege”. This is the most common meaning of the word. It means that the faith that those reading Peter’s letter have is not inferior to the faith of the apostles. It is the same kind of faith. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for equal standing (RSV, NRSV) <em>(RSV, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>“of equal value”. This is usually translated as BSB: “a faith as precious as ours.” <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow the first interpretation (1).</p>",

It is probable, however, that it is the same person throughout both verses. Both God and Christ are mentioned together in the previous verse, so that does not help us choose. Because of this, many translations (NIV, RSV) leave the pronouns like the Greek, so that the person reading the letter must decide for himself. You may decide to do the same thing. However it may not be possible in your language to do this and therefore you must make a decision. Studying the 2 verses together, it does seem that some of what Peter says about this person, for example, that “he called us,” is normally used only of God himself (see 1 Corinthians 1:9). Therefore, if in your language, you need to make clear to whom these pronouns refer, it would be better to choose God, rather than Christ (see GNT for one way of doing this). The BSB does this by capitalizing the first letter of these pronouns here. This is the interpretation these Notes will follow.</p></div><h4>1:3a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:3a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ God has given us<sup>(incl)</sup> everything we need to live <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for ever</span> and to behave in a way which pleases him, by means of the power he has because he is God,</p></li></ul></div><h4>1:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>through the knowledge of Him</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and by means of our<sup>(incl)</sup> knowing him.</p></li><li><p>This is possible because we<sup>(incl)</sup> know him.</p></li></ul></div><h4>1:3a-b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Peter told the people to whom he wrote this letter that everything they needed to live as genuine Christians was available to them because they now knew God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>His divine power:</strong> This refers to the power which God has because he is God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>life and godliness:</strong> There are two ways to interpret this:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>These are two separate ideas, so the meaning is “spiritual (or eternal) life and godly behavior”.

(GNT, JBP)</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow the first interpretation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>godliness:</strong> This means the good behavior of a person who has willingly chosen to live for God, and who wants to please him by doing everything in the way God wants him to.</p><h4>1:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who called us by His own glory and excellence.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It is he who has called us<sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be his people</span> by means of his greatness and his excellent character.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by His own glory and excellence:</strong> The Greek words here could mean one of two things:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“by means of his own glory and goodness”.

(GNT, RSV)</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow the first interpretation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>glory:</strong> See glory in <em>KBT</em>. The word <em>glory</em> means many different things in the New Testament. Here it refers to God’s greatness, his glorious character.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>excellence:</strong> This also refers to God’s character, to his moral goodness.</p>",

Instead, he was using metaphors to describe spiritual blindness. When people say that a person is spiritually blind, they mean that he does not understand about God or about living God’s way. One thing that people should understand about living God’s way is that after God has forgiven them for sinning against him, they should live in a way which pleases him. Peter wrote that people who do not understand this are like blind people.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>nearsighted to the point of blindness:</strong> These are two kinds of eye problems. When a person is <em>nearsighted</em>, he can see clearly only things which are very near to him. When referring to a person’s <em>blindness</em>, this indicates that he is completely unable to see. GNT combines the two:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so short-sighted that he cannot see (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The most important thing to do when you are translating this part of this verse is to check that the people who will read your translation understand that Peter was writing about spiritual blindness.</p><h4>1:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>having forgotten that he has been cleansed from his past sins.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He has forgotten that God has forgiven him for the sins he did before <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he believed in Christ.</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>cleansed from his past sins:</strong> The Greek verb here, which BSB translates as <em>cleansed</em>, means “to be made clean.” The New Testament often talks about a Christian being “cleansed” from his sins (see Titus 2:14). Many scholars believe that Peter is here talking about baptism, but it is probably best to translate this verb as “forgiven” in this context. (For more discussion on this word and other possible ways of translating it, see 1:9 in the <em>UBS Handbook on the Letter from Jude and the Second Letter from Peter.</em>)</p>",

When other people saw the Christians behaving well, it would help the other people to understand that God had called the Christians to be his people.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>brothers:</strong> Peter called the people to whom he wrote this letter his “brothers” because they were also members of God’s family. This was a common way for New Testament writers to address those to whom they were writing (see Galatians 1:11; Hebrews 3:12; James 1:2; 1 John 3:13). It may be advisable to translate this as “fellow believers” so that people who read your translation will not think that Peter was writing to his physical brothers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>strive:</strong> The Greek contains a word here that the BSB has left implicit. However, this word is in most translations and can have one of two meanings:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“more.” Most English versions interpret it in this way. They say that here it modifies the meaning of the word <em>strive</em> to mean “strive even more.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>be all the more eager (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>try even harder (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>“rather.” In verse 5, Peter had already urged the Christians to whom he was writing to do all that they could do to live in a good way. So some scholars believe that Peter used the word “rather” in order to contrast what he would write next with the preceding verse. He was saying, therefore, that Christians should not forget that God has cleansed us from the spiritual uncleanness that sinning against him caused. Instead, they should eagerly desire to show others that they were God’s people by the way they behave.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow the first interpretation (1) like most English versions. See the Meaning Line in the Display for an example.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>make your calling and election sure:</strong> Here, <em>election</em> means “choice.” The Bible clearly states that it is God who chooses and calls a person to become a Christian (see paragraph 1:3–4). But Peter wrote that Christians must cause their calling by God to be sure and certain. There are two possible ways of understanding this:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>From the preceding verses, it seems that Peter meant that, by behaving in a way that is full of character traits that are spiritually and morally excellent, we will prove to ourselves and to others that God has called us to be his people.</p></li><li><p>However, some people think that Peter meant that his readers needed to do all these things in order to ensure that their calling and election would not lapse, but would be permanent.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow the first interpretation (1) as it fits the context best.</p><h4>1:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For if you practice these things you will never stumble,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I say this</span> because if you<sup>(plur)</sup> do these things, you will at no time turn away from God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>stumble:</strong> The Greek word that Peter used here literally means “to stumble” or “to trip.” Here it is used as a figure of speech and can mean one of two things:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“to fall away from your faith,” that is, “to turn away from God.” Many versions follow this by saying “fall away” (GNT, JB).</p></li><li><p>“to commit serious sin.” Obviously all Christians sin, but here some scholars believe that Peter was saying that if a believer did all the things he had just been talking about, he would not sin in a really serious way.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The first interpretation (1) is recommended. If you are following this interpretation, try to find an idiomatic expression in your language that means this same thing. Here is an example: “you will at no time leave God’s road.” If you decide to use the word “stumble,” it may be necessary to add something that will tell the people who read your translation that this word refers to turning away from God.</p>",

They think this because in the following verse, Peter referred to the Transfiguration.

The Display of 1:17a shows one way to translate what Peter meant here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>honor and glory:</strong> These two words, <em>honor</em> and <em>glory</em>, are very similar in meaning. Some commentaries say two separate things are referred to: that “honor” refers to what God said and that “glory” refers to how Jesus shone brightly at the time that Peter was talking about. However other scholars think that they are a pair of words that Peter used together in this sentence in order to emphasize in a special way how much God honored Jesus. If that is how Peter used these words, it is possible to translate them together. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>greatly honored</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>truly honored (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God the Father:</strong> This is what the Greek text and most English versions say. If in your language, you need to make clear who God is the father of, you should translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God his Father (LB)</p></blockquote><h4>1:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>when the voice came to Him from the Majestic Glory, saying,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This happened when we<sup>(excl)</sup> heard</span> God, who is greater than all, saying,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Majestic Glory:</strong> Most commentaries say that this is a way of referring to God without mentioning his name. If you accept this interpretation, you should translate carefully in a way that ensures that both <em>the voice</em> and <em>the Majestic Glory</em> clearly refer to God the Father. One way to do this is to say “God who is very glorious” or “God who has great glory.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, other people think that <em>the Majestic Glory</em> referred to the bright cloud that the men who wrote the Gospel accounts spoke about (see Matthew 17:5).</p><h4>1:17c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:17c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“This person is my son whom I love. I am very pleased with him.”</p></li><li><p>“This is my son. I love him. He pleases me completely.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased:</strong> Peter quotes here the words that God the Father (speaking as a voice from heaven) spoke to Jesus, his Son, as recorded in the gospels. Check your translation of these words in Matthew 3:17 and 17:5 (similar in Mark 9:7 and Luke 3:22.) You should translate them the same way here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>This is My beloved Son:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>This is My beloved Son</em> is literally “This is my son the beloved.” The words “the beloved” indicate here that Jesus was God the Father’s one and only dear son. This phrase does not imply that God has other sons whom he did not love.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This is my own dear Son (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This is my dearly loved Son (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This <span data-bnType=\"implied\">person</span> is my son. I love him.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>My beloved Son:</strong> The phrase <em>My…Son</em> describes the relationship that Jesus had with God the Father. “God’s Son” or “the Son of God” is a title that was often used to refer to a savior who would be a descendant of King David. God would send this savior to rescue his people. This person was often referred to as the “Messiah” or “Christ.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The title “the Son of God” also indicates that Jesus has the same nature and character as God. The relationship between God the Father and Jesus, his Son, is similar in some way to the relationship between human fathers and sons. God the Father does not have a physical body. He did not have a sexual relationship with Mary that resulted in her becoming pregnant and giving birth to Jesus. The Son of God existed eternally as the Son with his Father.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In areas where people do not understand the title “the Son of God” in this way, you may want to include a footnote that explains the correct meaning. Here is a suggested footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This title refers to Jesus. It indicates that Jesus has the same nature and character as God. It does not mean that God the Father had a sexual relationship with Mary that resulted in her becoming pregnant and giving birth to Jesus. Mary became pregnant with Jesus in a miraculous way by the Holy Spirit of God.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is natural to speak of a son as a “child,” without specifying male or female. If that is true in your language, you may use a more general term, such as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>my Child<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A translation of the title “the Son of God” must include a familial term such as “son” or “child.” Translations such as “the man who is God,” “the divine man,” or “the God man” are not acceptable, since they do not retain familial language. Examples of acceptable translation options include “the Son who comes from God,” and “the divine/unique/eternal Son of God.”</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Other verses will usually make clear that Jesus was a male child. If you use a phrase such as “my male child,” be sure that it does not imply that God had another child who was female.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in whom I am well pleased:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>I am well pleased</em> means “I am delighted” or “I am very pleased/satisfied.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He makes me very happy/pleased.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in him I take great delight (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he makes my heart glad</p></blockquote>",

However some commentators think that here Peter was making a comparison and saying that people can now be even more confident that the words of the prophets are true than they could be before the Transfiguration because the apostles saw Moses and Elijah talking with Jesus at the Transfiguration. Here are some other ways that translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so we have confirmation of what was said in prophecy (JB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>all this confirms for us the message of prophecy (NEB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Peter referred to the words of the prophets to support what he taught about Christ’s return.

The morning star is the bright star (actually a planet, the planet Venus) which rises immediately before dawn. Does this star have a special name in your language? There are a number of examples in Scripture where the writers used similar metaphors in a way that shows that the morning star very probably refers to Christ. See Revelation 22:16 and Luke 1:78. In the same way that the morning star brings light to a dark world, the coming of Christ brings light into the hearts of believers and enables them to know God more fully. Peter was almost certainly thinking of Christ’s second coming, since “the day” in the NT usually referred to this, as in Romans 13:12.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>General Comment about 1:19b–c</u>: Here is one example of how you could translate 1:19b and 1:19c in order to clearly express all of the meaning of the metaphors:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You should listen well to those words until our Lord Jesus Christ returns.

It is unclear whose “interpretation” Peter is referring to. There are two main ways to understand this part of the verse:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some scholars believe it refers to the prophet’s own interpretation, that is, none of the OT prophets spoke any prophecy by his own power. This meaning fits with verse 21 which says it was God’s Spirit who inspired them.</p></li><li><p>Other scholars believe it refers generally to any person who hears or reads an OT prophecy. No one who hears or reads an OT prophecy should explain/interpret it by his own power. Peter was saying that no person had the right to interpret Scripture according to that person’s own ideas. If this interpretation is the correct one, then in this verse Peter was referring ahead to chapter 2 where he would speak about false teachers who twisted the meaning of Scripture as they wished. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the interpretation of scriptural prophecy is never a matter for the individual (JB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No one can interpret any prophecy of Scripture himself (NEB)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow the first interpretation (1). If, however, you decide to accept the second interpretation, you could translate it like this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You must understand that when a person reads the words of the prophets in Scripture and explains the meaning of those words according to his own thinking, he is not acting rightly.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This verse is very important for doctrine, so if you have footnotes in your translation, you should include a note that explains the interpretation which you have not followed in the main text.</p>",

Peter warned that, in the same way, false teachers would come among the Christians.</p><h4>2:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Now there were also false prophets among the people,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Long ago there were also prophets among God’s people who spoke lies <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the name of God.</span></p></li><li><p>¶ Long ago, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as well as true prophets</span> there were also people among God’s people who said that they were speaking messages from God but were really lying.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Now:</strong> At the end of chapter 1 Peter had been talking about true prophets. He used the word <em>Now</em> here to contrast these true prophets with the false prophets who had come among God’s people in the past. GNT and CEV do not retain this link. Another way to show the link would be as follows:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But, in the past, even though there were true prophets, there were also men among God’s people who said that they were prophets, but they taught lies, not the truth.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>false prophets:</strong> These are people who say that their messages come directly from God, but they are lying.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the people:</strong> Jews used the phrase “the people” to refer to themselves, God’s chosen people, the Jewish people. Here, Peter was referring to the Jewish people, the people of Israel, in the time of the OT.</p><h4>2:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>just as there will be false teachers among you.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>In the same way, among you<sup>(plur)</sup> there will be people who become teachers who teach lies.</p></li><li><p>In the same way, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as well as those who teach you<sup>(plur)</sup> true things about God</span> there will be people among you who teach you lies instead.</p></li></ul></div><h4>2:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>They will secretly introduce destructive heresies,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They will teach lies <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about God,</span> but they will not allow anyone to know that they are lies. These lies will ruin the people who believe them.</p></li><li><p>They will teach lies while pretending to teach the truth. These lies will ruin <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the hearts of</span> those people who believe them.</p></li></ul></div><h4>2:1b-c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>false teachers</strong> This refers to those who were teaching the “destructive heresies&quot;.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>secretly introduce:</strong> These words translate a single Greek verb that means “bring in,” and which sometimes means even more: “bring in secretly so that other people will not notice what is happening.” Many scholars believe that it has this extra meaning here. So BSB translates it <em>secretly introduce</em>, see also JB: “insinuate” and RSV “secretly bring in.” But GNT and NEB do not include this extra meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>destructive heresies:</strong> Heresy is a doctrine or teaching about God which is untrue. Such teachings lead people to live wickedly. When people live wickedly, God judges them. This is how <em>heresies</em> destroy them.</p><h4>2:1d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:1d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>even denying the Master who bought them—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>These teachers will even disown <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ</span> their Master who set them free<span data-bnType=\"implied\">from sin.</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>denying the Master:</strong> The Greek word here that BSB translates <em>denying</em> means “to deny, disown someone.” Here it probably means that although these people said that they followed Christ, they showed by what they did and by what they taught other people, that they did not really follow his teachings. It could also mean that they were “denying” Christ by saying untrue things about him like “he didn’t die for our sins.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Master:</strong> This translates the Greek word that usually in the NT refers to God, but here clearly Peter was using it about Christ. This is the word that people used to refer to a person who owned slaves. This word fits well here because of the next words which speak about Christ buying people.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who bought them:</strong> When Peter said Jesus “bought” people, he is using a metaphor. When Jesus died on the cross, the blood he shed was like the money someone gives the owner of a slave so that the slave can be free from his old master and can have a new master.</p><h4>2:1e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:1e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>bringing swift destruction on themselves.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Because they do that,</span> they will cause God to destroy them soon.</p></li><li><p>They will cause their own ruin to come soon.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>bringing swift destruction on themselves:</strong> Peter said that the way the false teachers were behaving would cause God to destroy them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>swift:</strong> The Greek word which BSB translates <em>swift</em> can mean “sudden” or “imminent, soon.” It is the same word that Peter used in 1:14 when he said that he would die <u>soon</u>, and that is probably the meaning here. He is not saying that God would suddenly destroy the false teachers, but that he would do it soon.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>destruction:</strong> The Greek word <em>apōleia</em>, “destruction,” is the same word as BSB translated “destructive” in 2:1c. It means “destruction, loss, ruin.” Here Peter was probably not referring to physical destruction, but spiritual ruin, or he may have meant that their influence over people would be destroyed. See destroy in <em>KBT</em>.</p>",

It is similar to the words which Peter used in 1:16a. There he said that what he and the other apostles taught were not fabricated stories.

He supported what he had said by telling three examples from the OT of how God punished wicked people and rescued people who obeyed him. These were examples with which the people to whom he wrote this letter would have been familiar.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek this whole paragraph is one long sentence, but it may be necessary for you to break it up. Read GNT and notice how that version has broken the one sentence into several shorter sentences. Perhaps you should begin this paragraph with “See” or “You know that.” Think about whether that would help people who read your translation to understand that Peter was starting to prove a point here. You may even need to repeat the “See” or “You know that” each time Peter used a new example.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Although verses 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 begin with “if” in the BSB, this is not because the events which Peter was talking about may not have happened.

The GNT shows one way to communicate this meaning without using the word “if” at all.</p></div><h4>2:4</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> Peter was now going to say why God would certainly punish the false teachers. GNT and CEV consider the link between the previous paragraph and the one that starts here in 2:4 to be clear enough, so they do not include any explicit translation of “For.” If it is necessary to clearly state the link in your language, you could say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I say that God is going to punish them because…</p></blockquote><h4>2:4a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:4a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For if God did not spare the angels when they sinned,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">You<sup>(plur)</sup> know that</span> long ago when some angels sinned, God did not ignore the evil that they had done.</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Remember that</span> long ago when some of the angels disobeyed God, he did not fail to punish them for what they did.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God did not spare the angels:</strong> This means that he did not overlook their sin. Instead, he punished them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>angels:</strong> The first example from the OT that Peter wrote about is what happened to the wicked angels. Scholars do not know for certain which angels were being referred to.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Bible scholars are not certain who these <em>angels</em> were. Some think the angels are “the sons of God” that Genesis 6:1–4 mentions, who came down to earth and married human women. But other scholars strongly disagree. They say that the phrase “sons of God” in Genesis does not refer to angels at all but rather to the descendants of Adam’s son, Seth. (One of the reasons they say that Genesis 6 does not refer to angels is because Jesus said in Mark 12:25 that angels do not marry.)</span></span></p><h4>2:4b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:4b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but cast them deep into hell,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He imprisoned them in the deep hole where he imprisons <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all</span> wicked people.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>hell:</strong> The Jews and Greeks who lived at the time when Peter was writing his letter believed that there was a deep pit under the earth where God imprisoned wicked angels and humans in order to punish them.</p><h4>2:4c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:4c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>placing them in chains of darkness to be held for judgment;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He will keep them in that dark prison until the day when he will judge <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and punish</span> them.</p></li><li><p>They will stay there in the darkness until the day when he will judge them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>chains of darkness:</strong> There is a problem in the Greek text here. Some manuscripts have “chains (<em>seirais</em>) of gloom” while others have “pits (<em>sirois</em>) of gloom.” That is why BSB says “chains of darkness” while some translations say “gloomy dungeons.” But the meaning of the two possible Greek phrases is almost the same. They both mean that God has imprisoned the wicked angels.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>darkness:</strong> This means “nearly dark.” The word describes what a place looks like when there is almost no light there.</p>",

The GNT shows one way to communicate this meaning without using the word “if” at all.</p></div><h4>2:9</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">This is what Peter used the examples in 2:4–8 to prove. The three examples show that God will punish wicked people and rescue good people.</p><h4>2:9a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>if all this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">All these things that God has done in the past show us<sup>(incl)</sup> that</span> the Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">certainly</span> keep safe when they are in trouble people who live the way God wants them to live.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Because God has acted like this in the past, we<sup>(incl)</sup> can be certain that</span> he will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">continue to</span> rescue people who obey him when they are being tested.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if all this is so:</strong> These words are not in the Greek text, but BSB includes them to show that Peter was now stating what all that he had said from verse 4 to 8 proved. The Display line of 2:9a shows a longer way to express this link. Here is a short way to express this link:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>therefore</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Lord knows how to:</strong> The meaning here is not just that God knows how to rescue godly people, but that he will certainly do it. It could also mean “he is accustomed to do it.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Lord:</strong> Here <em>the Lord</em> refers to God, not Jesus, and it may be necessary for you to translate it as “Lord God” to make this clear.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the godly:</strong> This is the opposite of the word translated “ungodly” in 2:5, 6. Godly people are those who do fear God and, as a result, behave in the way God wants them to. See also the note on “godliness” in 1:3a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>trials:</strong> Peter was thinking here about how Christians suffer when they live in a pagan society.</p><h4>2:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and to hold the unrighteous for punishment on the day of judgment.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They also show</span> that he will keep/take bad people and punish them continually until the day when he will judge all people.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">And we<sup>(incl)</sup> can also be certain that</span> he will not only punish the wicked people now but also keep them until the day when he will judge everyone.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to hold the unrighteous for punishment on the day of judgment:</strong> The literal meaning of this part of the verse is “to keep the wicked, being punished, for the day of judgment.” This part of the verse probably means one of two things:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>God is guarding wicked people carefully to prevent them from escaping so that he will be able to judge them on the Day of Judgement, when he will judge everyone. At the same time, he is already punishing them. The participle “being punished” is present tense which normally shows that the action is happening at the same time as the main verb (in this verse the main verb is “kept,” which the BSB translates as <em>hold</em>). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>how to keep the wicked under punishment for the Day of Judgement (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgement (RSV) <em>(NIV, GNT, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>God will finally condemn and punish wicked people on the Day of Judgement. Until then, he will guard them to prevent them from escaping. The present participle can have a future sense, and the words “judge” and “punish” usually refer to the final judgement, so some scholars believe that it is future punishment which Peter has referred to here.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and how to reserve his punishment for the wicked until their day comes (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and hold the wicked for their punishment until the day of Judgement (JB) <em>(BSB, JBP, JB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow the first interpretation (1), which is in the Meaning Line of the Display.</p>",

But God would certainly destroy these false teachers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Many of the verses in this section are similar to verses in Jude’s letter. Whoever wrote second, Peter or Jude, may have had a copy of the other one’s letter and used words and ideas out of that letter. Or perhaps someone else had written something with similar words and ideas in it, and Peter and Jude both used words and ideas from that writing. Why these two letters are so similar is not the most important thing. But if you have already translated Jude, it is important to have that translation open in front of you while you are studying and translating this section of 2 Peter. However be careful not to copy any verse exactly from Jude’s letter to your translation of 2 Peter, because there are differences between them which must remain in your translation.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1062002004\" data-endVerseId=\"1062002010\"><h3>Paragraph 2:4–10a</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Peter wrote this paragraph mainly to support what he said in 2:3b–c. He supported what he had said by telling three examples from the OT of how God punished wicked people and rescued people who obeyed him. These were examples with which the people to whom he wrote this letter would have been familiar.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek this whole paragraph is one long sentence, but it may be necessary for you to break it up. Read GNT and notice how that version has broken the one sentence into several shorter sentences. Perhaps you should begin this paragraph with “See” or “You know that.” Think about whether that would help people who read your translation to understand that Peter was starting to prove a point here. You may even need to repeat the “See” or “You know that” each time Peter used a new example.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Although verses 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 begin with “if” in the BSB, this is not because the events which Peter was talking about may not have happened. These events all did happen. This use of “if” in English (and Greek) was to prove a point, here what Peter said in verse 9. The GNT shows one way to communicate this meaning without using the word “if” at all.</p></div><h4>2:10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Such punishment is specially reserved for those who indulge the corrupt desires of the flesh and despise authority.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Above all, he will severely punish those people who do shameful things which their bodies want to do and which defile them, and who reject <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> right to rule over them.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God will punish all wicked people but</span> he will punish very severely those who do the shameful things which they want to do and which make them morally impure and those who think they do not need to obey <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his</span> commands.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">God will punish all people who do wrong. In verses 4–9, Peter had been talking about such people in general, but now in verse 10, he returned to the false teachers whom, he said, God would punish especially severely. He gave two reasons for this: their immoral behavior and the way they despised authority.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the flesh:</strong> The BSB translates the Greek word literally as <em>flesh</em>. This refers to the fact that people want to do what their bodies desire to do, even if this is something wrong. In this verse, Peter was referring to sinful sexual behavior which causes people to think and behave in an impure way.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>authority:</strong> This probably refers to the right that God and Christ have to rule people. GNT: “and despise God’s authority.” But some scholars think it means the right that any person has to rule people. If these scholars are correct, Peter was talking about people who not only despised God’s right to rule people but also despised the right that humans, for example government and church leaders, have to rule other people.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1062002010\" data-endVerseId=\"1062002013\"><h3>Paragraph 2:10b–13a</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Peter was saying that the false teachers did all kinds of wicked things. They did not show respect for anyone, not even those greater than themselves. They behaved like wild animals, doing only what their bodies desired to do. Because they were so evil, and because they enticed others to behave as they themselves did, God would destroy them.</p></div><h4>2:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Bold and self-willed,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">These false teachers whom I am speaking about</span> are not afraid to do what they want to do. They are proud.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Bold:</strong> This word can mean “courageous,” which is something good. But here it described people who dared to do all kinds of wrong things because they did not respect and fear God as people should respect and fear him, and because they did not care about other people.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>self-willed:</strong> This word described people who were proud and stubborn. They did not listen to anyone else. Instead, they did exactly what they wanted to do.</p><h4>2:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>they are unafraid to slander glorious beings.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They are not afraid to insult those beings <span data-bnType=\"implied\">up above</span> who have honor.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>unafraid to slander:</strong> Most versions interpret these words like BSB in a way that refers to only one action. This is the most likely interpretation. Here is another example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>are not afraid of offending the glorious ones (JB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">GNT follows the other interpretation and refers to two actions:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>“they show no respect—instead they insult them.”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>glorious beings:</strong> The literal meaning of the Greek is “glorious ones.” It is difficult to know to whom Peter was referring. The word may refer to:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>angels or other heavenly beings, maybe the wicked angels that Peter mentioned in verse 4. The parallel verses 8–11 in Jude clearly refer to angels.</p></li><li><p>important people such as emperors, magistrates, or important church leaders. But this is less likely since the word usually refers to spiritual beings.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">If possible, it is better to choose a neutral expression which could refer to any living beings, heavenly or human leaders. But if this is impossible, choose one of these interpretations and translate it that way. Then if you are using footnotes, explain the other interpretation in a note.</p>",

Many scholars think that Peter meant to say that the angels were stronger than the false teachers. Others think he meant that the angels were stronger than the celestial beings. If your language requires that you say whom the angels are stronger than, we recommend that you say that they are stronger than the false teachers.

God will destroy these false teachers in the same way that men catch and kill wild animals.</p><h4>2:12a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:12a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>These men are like irrational animals, creatures of instinct, born to be captured and destroyed.

For example:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Since the false teachers behave like wild animals, God will destroy them in the same way as people destroy wild animals.

What Peter implied by these words is that these false teachers were extremely wicked, so wicked that God had cursed them. People usually think it is wrong to curse anyone. But this verse does not mean that God has done something wrong. It means that God has declared that these people will go to hell and he will punish them there because they have sinned against him. You must translate these words carefully. If in your language the word for cursing always means doing something evil, it would be better to say “God will punish them.”</p><h4>2:14e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:14e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>with hearts trained in greed.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They have taught themselves to be very greedy.</p></li><li><p>They have become very greedy indeed.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>hearts trained in greed:</strong> The literal meaning of the Greek is “having been trained in greed.” The verb “to train” usually refers to a person training himself for a race.

However, because what they said sounded impressive, it deceived people who had recently become Christians and encouraged them to live in an immoral way.</p><h4>2:18a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:18a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>With lofty but empty words,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">When they teach people,</span> what they say sounds important, but it is worthless.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>lofty but empty words:</strong> Peter used two words in Greek which contrast with each other. The teaching of the false teachers was impressive or <em>lofty</em> (literally “very big, excessive”), but at the same time, it was also <em>empty</em>, it had no value or sense.</p><h4>2:18b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:18b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>they appeal to the sensual passions of the flesh</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They tell people that they can do the shameful things their bodies want to do,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Because what the false teachers said sounded so impressive, it deceived people and they believed it and acted in the way the false teachers said they could.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they appeal to the sensual passions of the flesh:</strong> This refers to behaving in a sexually immoral way, acting according to what their bodies told them and what they wanted to do. See the note on 2:2a. The false teachers enticed the new Christians away from the truth by teaching them that they were free to act immorally if they wanted to.</p><h4>2:18c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:18c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and entice those who are just escaping from others who live in error.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">and they use that promise as a bait</span> to lure people away from the true/right way to live.

It literally means “to lure/trap/catch with bait.” Peter has used it in a figurative way in both verses; what the false teachers say and what they promise (verse 19) sounds so good that it attracts people away from the true teaching and way to live, in the same way that a person uses bait to attract an animal so he can catch it.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those who are just escaping from others who live in error:</strong> This probably refers to people who had recently become Christians. Peter was probably referring to the same people as in verse 14, where he described them as “the unstable.” They were new Christians who did not yet completely understand all they believed.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here Peter described becoming a Christian as “escaping from others who live in error.” Peter did not mean that they had run away from the non-Christians, but that they no longer behaved in the same wrong way as those people did.</p>",

In other words, these teachers taught that God no longer required people to obey his laws.

Most probably they were promising that those who followed them would be free from the need to obey any rules on how a Christian should behave. They were probably teaching that Christians could therefore behave just as they wanted to, even immorally. In languages where there is no word for <em>freedom</em>, you could translate this as: “You are no longer under the law,” or “God does not require you to obey his laws any more.”</p><h4>2:19b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:19b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>while they themselves are slaves to depravity.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But the false teachers themselves <span data-bnType=\"implied\">are not free to do as they like.

Peter quoted it to explain why he had called the false teachers “slaves of depravity” in 19b.

This makes his words very vivid. You may not be able to use the same figurative language in your translation, but try to find other ways of making your translation as vivid as the original.</p></div><h4>2:20–22</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">It is not clear about whom Peter was speaking in these verses.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>He may have been referring to the false teachers. This is the most natural way to understand the Greek. Some English versions use the pronoun “they” here. As the false teachers have been the main subject of the verses which precede this verse, it seems that these versions follow this interpretation. <em>(BSB, NIV, RSV, CEV)</em></p></li><li><p>Some scholars say that Peter was referring to the people who had recently become Christians. Peter used the same verb (BSB “escaped”) in this verse as he had used in verse 18 when speaking of those who had recently become Christians.</p></li><li><p>Or perhaps he was stating generally that if any person who had become a Christian returned to pagan ways, the result for him would be worse than if he had remained a pagan and had never become a Christian in the first place. Some versions translate the subject as referring to people in general. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>anyone (JB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>men (JBP) <em>(JB, JBP, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">This whole chapter has described the false teachers, and they are the subject of verses 18 and 19, so it seems most likely that verse 20 also refers to these teachers, though Peter’s words are also true about anyone who has turned away from following Christ. The Notes follow this interpretation. According to this interpretation, “If” at the beginning of the verse is stating a fact (as in 2:4). It is not referring to something that may or may not have happened. (See the last paragraph of the note in the introduction to 2:4–10a).</p><h4>2:20</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek, and in BSB, NIV, and GNT, this verse is one sentence, but you will probably need to break it into two or more sentences.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek text the word <em>gar</em>, which some versions translate as “for,” shows how Peter linked this verse to the verses which preceded it. Other versions like BSB, NIV, GNT and CEV leave the relationship implicit.</p><h4>2:20a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:20a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>If indeed they have escaped the corruption of the world</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I say that about the false teachers because</span> they had come out from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the power of</span> the bad things of this world which spoil <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the hearts of</span> people.</p></li><li><p>They had left those sinful ways that ruin a person’s character. These are the ways which the people of this world <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who do not obey God</span> habitually follow.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>corruption:</strong> Literally “defilement, pollution.” The Greek word that Peter used here is not the same as the one he used in 1:4b, but the underlying meaning is almost the same.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the world:</strong> This does not refer to the physical world which God created, but to the non-Christians among whom the people to whom Peter was writing lived. These people practiced many immoral customs which ruined people spiritually. When Peter wrote about the “corruption of the world” in this verse he was referring to such immoral customs. See also note on 1:4b.</p><h4>2:20b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:20b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This happened because</span> they had come to know Jesus Christ who is our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord and Savior.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ:</strong> Peter has already used the expression <em>the knowledge of</em> several times in this letter (see 1:2, 1:8 and the notes on those verses). It is by means of coming to know Christ that a person is able to escape from living in the wicked way the non-Christians live.</p><h4>2:20c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:20c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>only to be entangled and overcome by it again,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But now once more they have gotten involved in doing bad things and those bad things now control them,</p></li><li><p>But now they have allowed the bad things to again catch them and control them,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>entangled:</strong> When used literally the Greek word which BSB translates <em>entangled</em> means “entwined.” It is the word used when a woman plaits her hair. Here Peter used it figuratively and it means “to be involved in, mixed up with.” This part of the verse says that the false teachers have once more got involved in the wicked way of living from which they had escaped when they came to know Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>overcome by it again:</strong> This is the same Greek verb as Peter used in 19c, where BSB translates it “mastered.” Here again Peter was saying that the false teachers, despite having once become free from the wicked things which non-Christians do, once more were allowing those things to control them.</p><h4>2:20d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:20d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>their final condition is worse than it was at first.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so their last condition/state <span data-bnType=\"implied\">now that they have rejected Christ</span> is worse than their condition at first <span data-bnType=\"implied\">before they became believers.</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>their final condition:</strong> This phrase refers to the time when Peter was writing, the time after the false teachers had turned away from the true Christian teaching which they once followed.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it was at first:</strong> This phrase refers to the time before they became Christians.</p>",

That is why the word also means “not spoiled by sin,” and “pure/righteous.” In this verse the word <em>holy</em> has its basic meaning and means that God had set the prophets aside for himself so that he could use them. When Peter used the word <em>holy</em> here, he was not referring to whether the Old Testament prophets were righteous or not. So when you translate <em>holy</em> here, you should choose an expression which means “set apart for God” or “belonging to God,” rather than a word to mean “good” or “righteous.”</p><h4>3:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and commanded by our Lord and Savior through your apostles.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I want you<sup>(plur)</sup> to remember too</span> the teaching of our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus Christ,</span> our Saviour, which the apostles who came to you taught you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>commanded:</strong> Here <em>commanded</em> probably refers to everything that Christ taught, not just one thing which he taught.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>your apostles:</strong> The NT uses the word “apostles” for different groups of people and so there are several different opinions among Bible scholars as to whom Peter meant here. Some think he meant the twelve apostles. Some include Paul. Some think he meant those of the twelve who brought the gospel to the people who were reading Peter’s letter. Others think “apostles” has the more general meaning of “missionaries.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If in your language you translate the word “apostles” by a term which uses the verb “send,” you may need to be careful that the phrase you use here for “your apostles” does not give the wrong meaning of “the apostles you sent,” but rather “the apostles Christ sent to you.”</p>",

They would say that, although he had said that there would be various signs and wonders immediately before he returned (see Mark 13:24–26), these had not happened. There had been no change, and the world was the same as it had always been since God created it. The scoffers would claim that this proved that Christ would not return at all.</p><h4>3:4a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:4a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Where is the promise of His coming?” they will ask.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and they will say, “Didn’t he promise to return?

GNT may be a helpful model: “He promised to come, didn’t he? Where is he?” If you translate it as a statement, and not as a question, you must use a vivid expression. Some suggestions are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“He promised to return, but those were merely empty words!”</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“When he promised to return, he was lying!”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The source of this promise is both in Old Testament prophecies (see 1:19) and in the words of Christ himself (see Matthew 24).</p><h4>3:4b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:4b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Ever since our fathers fell asleep,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We<sup>(excl)</sup> say that he will not come because</span> those who were our leaders at first have all died,</p></li></ul></div><h4>3:4c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:4c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>everything continues as it has from the beginning of creation.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">but still nothing has changed.</span> Things remain the same as they have been since God created the world.”</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">but still nothing has changed.</span> Things continue to happen in the same way as they have happened since God created the world.”</p></li></ul></div><h4>3:4b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">This part of the verse tells the reason that the people who are scoffing will give when they say that Christ will not return.

In the Display line for 3:4b, there is an example of how to show the relationship between 3:4b and the previous sentence.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>our fathers:</strong> Literally “the fathers.” In Greek, as in many other languages, the word “father” means not only a biological father, but can mean “an ancestor,” “respected leader who lived in the past,” “the originator of something,” and “a person older than the speaker.” Because Peter spoke here of “the fathers,” he was probably referring to a specific and respected group of people who lived before the scoffers and to whom they were referring. There are different opinions about which group Peter meant:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>the first generation of Christians,</p></li><li><p>the generation that preceded the generation of which the scoffers were a part,</p></li><li><p>the patriarchs and prophets,</p></li><li><p>the ancestors of the human race.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Although elsewhere in the NT the word usually refers to the important leaders in the OT, in the present context Peter probably meant interpretation (1), the first generation of Christians.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Jesus himself seemed to have said that he would return in the lifetime of the first disciples (see Matthew 10:23; Mark 9:1; John 21:21–22); angels from God promised Jesus’ disciples that he would return (see Acts 1:11); and his disciples expected him to return while they were still alive. So when the first Christians began to die and Christ had still not returned, some people, like the people in this verse, started to doubt that he would come back at all.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>fell asleep:</strong> This is a euphemism for “dying.” If you have a euphemism for “dying” in your language, you could use it here.</p>",

In these verses, Peter said that this was not true. For example, God had interrupted that pattern when he caused a flood to punish people for sinning against him. And he would interrupt the pattern again in the future, but this time he would destroy the world by fire.

The Greek text shows the link with the previous verse by using the word <em>gar</em>, “for.” Most English translations leave this relationship implicit. In the Display line for 3:5a, there is an example of how to translate this part of the verse in a way that clearly shows this relationship.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>deliberately overlook:</strong> The literal meaning of the Greek is “it escapes notice.” It may not make sense in your language to say “deliberately overlook.” Peter was saying that these people were choosing to ignore things they knew.</p><h4>3:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that long ago by God’s word</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>that long ago God gave an order,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by God’s word:</strong> Beginning in the book of Genesis, the Bible says that when God created the world, he did so by speaking, giving an order (see Genesis 1:3, 1:6, 1:9, 1:11, 1:14, 1:20, 1:24, 1:26.) This phrase probably goes with both 5c and 5d—God created both the sky and the earth by his word, and you need to make sure your translation makes that clear.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">GNT makes this clear by treating “heaven and earth” as a single unit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God gave a command and the heavens and the earth were created. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In JB, the phrase “by the Word of God” applies only to the earth:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>There were heavens at the beginning and the earth was formed by the Word of God.

Peter was not talking here about the place where God is. Peter used the plural noun <em>heavens</em>, even though its meaning is singular. Many NT writers use this form of the word, but it does not mean that Peter was referring to more than one “heaven.” This is also acceptable in English, but you should only use a plural in your translation if it is natural to do so.</p><h4>3:5d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:5d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and the earth was formed out of water and by water,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">By that same order</span> he caused the earth to appear out of the water, and it was water that he used to make the earth.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">In the same way, by giving an order</span> he used water to make the earth and he caused the earth to appear out of the water.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>earth was formed out of water:</strong> There are two ways that we can understand this:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Peter was referring to Genesis chapter 1 which tells how God gathered the waters together into seas and made the earth (or land) appear out of the water.</p></li><li><p>Some commentators believe, however, that these words mean that God used water as the material from which he formed the earth.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow the first interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>earth was formed…by water:</strong> The Greek word <em>dia</em> can mean “by” or “through.” There are again different opinions about what this means.

According to this interpretation, the same idea—the word of God—occurs in each of the three verses 5–7. These people think it is unlikely that Peter would use a plural pronoun to refer to a single substance (water), and that he would then also repeat the word “water” later in the same sentence.

It may be necessary to clearly state this in your translation, otherwise the people who read it might think that Peter was saying that Christ is like a thief. If many people who read your translation think that it is not good to compare Christ to a thief, even when someone explains the similarity to them, then you should omit the reference to a thief and just say what the verse means. You could say something like “he will come unexpectedly.” Peter put the verb “will come” at the beginning of the sentence in the Greek in order to emphasize that Christ will certainly come.</p><h4>3:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The heavens will disappear with a roar,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">At that time</span> there will be a roaring noise in the sky, and the sky will disappear.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with a roar:</strong> The Greek word that BSB translates <em>roar</em> means “a rushing or hissing sound,” for example, the sound that a bird makes when it flaps its wings, or the sound that water makes when it flows in a river.

The English versions treat the problem in different ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><em>heurethēsetai</em> “will be found.” Some Greek manuscripts say this. The difficulty with this word is to decide what it means in this context. Some scholars say it means that people’s deeds <em>will be laid bare.</em> At the time that God will judge people, he will expose the things that they have done. Others think that this is a rhetorical question: “Will the earth and everything in it be found?” With the implied answer: “No, certainly not.” Then it means “the earth and everything in it will not be found,” that is, they will have vanished. <em>(BSB, NIV, NRSV, NEB)</em></p></li><li><p><em>katakaēsetai</em> “will be burned up.” Some Greek manuscripts say this. <em>(RSV, JB)</em></p></li><li><p>Some translations have “will disappear,” “vanish” which is equivalent to translating the first interpretation above as a rhetorical question. <em>(GNT, JBP)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Scholars are not certain what Peter wrote.

Most scholars think it refers to the new heavens and the new earth, but it could also refer to all the events that Peter, in the verses immediately preceding this one, had said would happen on the Day of the Lord. These events will include God’s creation of new heavens and a new earth after he has destroyed the old ones.</p><h4>3:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>make every effort to be found at peace—spotless and blameless in His sight.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>try hard <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to do only what is right,</span> so that God will consider you<sup>(plur)</sup> pure, so that he will not say that you have behaved badly, and so that God will see that you<sup>(plur)</sup> are at peace with him.</p></li><li><p>try hard <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to do only what is right,</span> so that God will consider you<sup>(plur)</sup> pure, without fault, and at peace with him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when Christ returns,</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to be found at peace—spotless and blameless:</strong> The verb <em>to be found</em> applies to <em>at peace</em> and <em>spotless and blameless</em>. Peter was telling his readers that they were to do their best so that when Christ returned, God would find them pure, blameless, and at “peace” with him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to be found…spotless:</strong> This means “that God may see that you are pure,” or “that you may be pure in God’s sight.” Most scholars think that this refers to being in this pure condition when Christ returns. But some people think it means being pure now and always. Whatever it means, in order to be sure that God will consider a person pure when Christ returns, that person needs to try hard to remain spotless at all times.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>spotless and blameless:</strong> These two words are very similar in meaning. People often used them to describe a perfect animal which was fit to sacrifice to God. When people used these words about an animal they were going to sacrifice, they were referring to the physical condition of the animal, but here Peter was referring to the spiritual condition of the people to whom he was writing. He wanted them to guard themselves so that they would not do wrong in any way.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If it is difficult in your language to find two words with this meaning, you could use only one and strengthen it by using “very” or “completely.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>completely pure</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in His sight:</strong> The Greek word that BSB translates as <em>in His sight</em> could also mean “to him” or “by him.” Because the order of the words in Greek is ambiguous, it is not certain which other part of the sentence this phrase belongs to. Some scholars think that it goes with “at peace,” while others think that it goes with “to be found” or with “spotless and blameless.” So there are the following interpretations:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“at peace with him,” or, in other words, at peace with God. <em>(NIV and NLT translate it in this way.)</em></p></li><li><p>“to be found by him,” or, in other words, he sees them in this condition. <em>(NRSV and JB translate it in this way.)</em></p></li><li><p>“spotless and blameless to him,” or, in other words, in his sight. <em>(BSB translates it in this way.)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">According to the second and third interpretations, Peter did not say with whom the readers should be at peace. He was probably talking about peace with God, but he may have been talking about peace with their neighbors and fellow Christians, too.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions seem to combine (1) and (3). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to be pure and blameless in God’s sight and to be at peace with him. (GNT)</p></blockquote>",
