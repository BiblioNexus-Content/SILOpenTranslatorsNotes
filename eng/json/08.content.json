Most versions, like the BSB spell the name as Elimelech. The NIV (2011) spells the name with a final k (Elimelek). The Notes will follow the spelling used by any quoted versions.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section contains the first main event of the story. An Israelite named Elimelech moved to the neighboring country of Moab with his wife, Naomi, and their two sons because there was famine in Israel. Elimelech died in Moab. His two sons later married women from Moab, Ruth and Orpah. Both of the sons then also died.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section has two paragraphs:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paragraph 1:1–2 gives an introduction. Verse 1 gives the setting of the story and introduces the main characters in this event.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paragraph 1:3–5 describes the event in detail.

Verse 1:2 gives the name of each character. However, if this is not a natural way to introduce characters in your language, another option is to combine 1:1–2 and introduce the characters by name. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1–2</sup>Long ago, in the days before Israel had a king, there was a famine in the land.

After that time period, kings ruled the country.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate this phrase:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Make explicit the role/function of the judges.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In the days when the Judges <u>were governing</u> (NJB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Leave implicit the role/function of the judges. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>During the time of the judges (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Make explicit the location where the judges ruled. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Long ago when the judges ruled <u>Israel</u> (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the judges:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>the judges</em> refers to the leaders or chiefs who ruled in Israel at that time.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In the days when the chieftains ruled (NJPS)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>During the time that leaders ruled/governed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the:</strong> The definite article <em>the</em> implies that the audience of this story already knew who the judges were. If this is new information to your readers, it may be better to translate “judges” without the definite article. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>During the time when judges ruled</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>ruled:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>ruled</em> is literally “judged.” They judged by deciding what was right and what was wrong when problems were brought to them, and then they gave their decisions to the people involved. However, their activities were more varied than the activities of a judge in most cultures today. They also led the people to fight against any oppressors.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>governed (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>led the people</p></blockquote><h4>1:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>there was a famine in the land.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>there was a shortage/lack of food in the land <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Israel</span>.</p></li><li><p>there was a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">time when</span> people there did not have enough food to eat.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>there was a famine:</strong> This clause means that there was not enough food for people to eat. In Hebrew, the word <em>famine</em> is also the word “hunger.” The verse does not give a cause of the famine. However, lack of rain was a common cause and is probably implied here.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Lack of rain as the cause of the famine is suggested by ZIBBC (pages 244–245), ZECOT (page 64), and UBS (page 6).</span></span> If your language requires you to give a reason for the famine, you can make explicit that this <em>famine</em> was the result of a lack of rain.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>there was a shortage of food (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>many people were hungry</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Be careful to translate <em>famine</em> in a way that does not imply that the famine lasted the entire time that the judges ruled. The <em>famine</em> lasted for a period of years, but the judges ruled for hundreds of years.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the land:</strong> This phrase refers to the land of Israel. The famine was probably widespread throughout the country.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate this phrase:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Make the referent of the phrase explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>there was a famine <u>in the land of Israel</u></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Leave the referent of the phrase implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>there was a famine <u>in the land</u> (ESV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Substitute a different word or phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a famine occurred <u>in the country</u> (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>many people were hungry <u>there</u><span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This example is an option if you have made explicit the phrase “in Israel” in 1:1a.</span></span></p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>1:1c–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And a certain man from Bethlehem in Judah, with his wife and two sons, went to reside in the land of Moab:</strong> Here are some ways to indicate the connection of this clause to the previous clause. Any of these options is acceptable:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Indicate that this clause is the result of the famine that is described in the previous clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>So</u> a man from Bethlehem in Judah went to live as a resident foreigner in the region of Moab, along with his wife and two sons. (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Indicate that this clause is the next action in the story. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>and</u> a man of Bethlehem in Judah, with his wife and two sons, went to reside in the country of Moab. (NJPS)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Leave the connection to the previous clause implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A man from Bethlehem in Judah went with his wife and two sons to live for a while in the country of Moab. (GW)</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>1:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And a certain man from Bethlehem in Judah,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>A man from Bethlehem in Judah</p></li><li><p>So a man whose <span data-bnType=\"implied\">home was</span> Bethlehem, in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the land of the tribe of</span> Judah,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a certain man from Bethlehem in Judah:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase is more literally “he went a man from Bethlehem Judah.” There are two main interpretations of this phrase:<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>WBC (pages 62–63) says that “It is syntactically impossible to tell whether “from Bethlehem in Judah” modifies the verb “went” (i.e., “went from Bethlehem in Judah”) or the noun “man” (i.e., “a man from Bethlehem in Judah”).</span></span></p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The home of the man was Bethlehem in Judah. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a man from Bethlehem in Judah (NET) <em>(BSB, CEV, ESV, GNT, GW, KJV, NABRE, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, NJB, NJPS, NLT, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The man departed from Bethlehem in Judah. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So a man named Elimelech left the town of Bethlehem in Judah (NCV) <em>(NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a certain man:</strong> This phrase introduces the first character in the story. In this verse, the author does not say the name of the man.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a man (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural to introduce the character by name instead of using the phrase <em>a certain man</em>. See the 1:1–2 paragraph description for an example.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Bethlehem in Judah:</strong> This phrase refers to the town of Bethlehem in the region of Judah.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Judah:</strong> <em>Judah</em> was the name of the region where the descendants of Judah, son of Jacob, lived. It was in the southern part of the land of Israel. See the map of Judah in the section description.</p><h4>1:1d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>with his wife and two sons, went to reside in the land of Moab.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>went with his wife and his two sons to live temporarily in the country of Moab.</p></li><li><p>moved to the region of Moab to live there for a while. His wife and their two sons went with him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with his wife and two sons:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase is more literally “he his wife and his two sons.” This phrase introduces additional characters in the story. They are the family members of “a certain man from Bethlehem.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the Hebrew phrase, the man is the subject. The family members are described in relation to him, as “<u>his</u> wife” and “<u>his</u> two sons.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate this phrase:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate more literally. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he and his wife and <u>his two sons</u> (ESV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate in a way that refers to both parents. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>with his wife…and <u>their two sons</u> (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Leave the pronoun “his” implied in the second part of the phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>with his wife and <u>two sons</u> (REB)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this introduction of the family members in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>went to reside:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>to reside</em> means “dwell as a stranger.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NIDOTTE (page 836): dwell as a stranger, become a refugee, BDB (page 157): 1. <em>sojourn</em>, dwell for a (definite or indef.) time, dwell as a new-comer without original rights.</span></span> In this verse, the Hebrew word referred to a temporary stay.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to WBC (page 63), “The verb in and of itself does not necessarily connote a temporary stay…for many “resident aliens” lived in a community more or less permanently. A move because of famine, however, would normally suggest that it was not intended to be permanent.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the land of Moab:</strong> <em>Moab</em> is a region that is located to the east of Judah.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>To get to <em>Moab</em>, Elimelech and his family probably traveled about eighty kilometers (fifty miles). They would have traveled east from Bethlehem around the north end of the Dead Sea, and then south into <em>Moab</em>. <em>Moab</em> is south and east from Israel, on the east side of the Dead Sea.</span></span> See the map in the section description.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In this phrase, the Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>land</em> means “field,” “country” or “land.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT #2236b.</span></span> The majority of versions translate this word as “country.” However, in this verse, the word could have any of these meanings.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>ZECOT (page 68) says that this Hebrew word “usually refers to land as a field that has been brought under human occupation and cultivation.” See also NICOT (pages 86–87).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>on the <u>plateau</u><span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NICOT (page 86) suggests that the Hebrew word may refer to a “fertile plateau about twenty-five miles wide along (and several thousand feet above) the Dead sea’s eastern shore.” of Moab (NAB)</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in the <u>country</u> of Moab (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In the <u>region</u> of Moab (NET)</p></blockquote>",

After Elimelech and his family went to Moab, Naomi’s husband and her two sons died. She became a widow with no male family members to provide for her and protect her. This crisis is the main problem of the story.

The first issue is about the referent of this verse part:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>This verse part refers to the two sons (or the two sons, their wives, and Naomi). The ten year period refers to the time that the sons (or the two sons, their wives, and Naomi) lived in Moab after they married Orpah and Ruth.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and they lived there about ten years. <sup>1:5</sup>Then those two—Mahlon and Chilion—also died (NJPS) <em>(GW, KJV, NASB, NET, NJB, NJPS)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>This verse part begins a clause that continues in 1:5.

It is the same pattern as the summary introduction in 1:1, in which Elimelech and his family members are not named. For that reason, 1:5b may be a summary closing to this section.

Thus, this section begins and ends with a summary description of the main event.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NICOT (pages 99–100 ): The common Hebrew idiom <em>qûm</em> plus a verb of motion (<em>šûḇ</em>) also signals the start of the story’s main action: Then she…returned. Structurally, the idiom is a summary-introduction to the following events (vv. 7–21) and forms an inclusio with the chapter’s summary-conclusion (cf. <em>wattāšāḇ</em>, v. 22). Further, it sounds the chapter’s main theme, namely, the return of Naomi.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other scholars do not believe that verse 1:6 is a summary introduction.

However, the first suggestion follows a pattern that is also in some other Hebrew narratives. An event is introduced by a summary statement, and the verses after it describe that event in detail.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example: Genesis 1:1 introduces the creation account of 1:2–31.

It may be helpful to your readers to make some of this information explicit. Your translation should not give the impression that the LORD gave them food directly and miraculously.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to make more explicit how the LORD provided food for his people:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>reversing the famine by providing abundant crops (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>by giving them good crops again (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>1:6a–b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:6a–b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(combined/reordered)</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Naomi prepared to return from Moab with her daughters-in-law, because she had heard in Moab that Yahweh had helped his people by giving them food.</p></li></ul></div><h4>1:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>she and her daughters-in-law prepared to leave the land of Moab.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Because of that news,</span> Naomi decided to return from the land of Moab, with the wives of her two sons.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">So</span> Naomi, accompanied by her daughters-in-law, got ready to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">leave Moab and</span> go back home <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to Israel</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>she and her daughters-in-law prepared to leave the land of Moab:</strong> This verse part is more literally “and she arose she and her daughters-in-law and she returned from the region of Moab.” The Hebrew phrase “she arose…and she returned” is a Hebrew idiom that introduces the event of Naomi’s return that follows in 1:7–21. In Hebrew the verbs “arose” and “returned” are singular, with Naomi as the subject.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>WBC (page 66) notes that Naomi is the singular subject of the verbs in 1:6 and the start of 1:7. She arose, she returned, she heard, and she set forth. This syntax is unusual. Plural verbs are expected here, with Naomi and the daughters-in-law as a compound subject. WBC suggests that the effect of the singular forms is that the true subject of all the clauses is Naomi alone. This effect can be reflected with a translation such as “she set out with her daughters-in-law” rather than “she and her daughters-in-law set out.” This unusual syntax is also noted by AYB (page 85), KD (page 344), and NICOT (pages 99–100).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are two possible functions of this idiom:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The function of the idiom is to introduce the first part of Naomi’s return to Bethlehem from Moab.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This function of the idiom is supported by UBS (page 9).</span></span> It refers to her decision or preparation to return. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So she <u>decided to return</u> home from the region of Moab, accompanied by her daughters-in-law (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So Naomi land her daughters-in-law <u>got ready to leave Moab to return</u> to her homeland. (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>The function of the idiom is to introduce a summary of Naomi’s return to Bethlehem from Moab. It refers to the entire event. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then she arose with her daughters-in-law and she <u>returned</u> from the region of Moab.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">The Display will follow the first option, since it is followed by a majority of versions. However, both options have merit. You will need to decide which option to follow for your translation. For more information, see the comments for section 1:6–22.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:6a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The BSB and some other versions have reordered the verse parts.

If that is true in your language, consider providing a brief explanation in a footnote.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is a footnote example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Naomi’s words may imply that it is more appropriate for the two widows to go home to their mothers, rather than stay with their mother-in-law.

In this verse it refers particularly to faithfulness, love, and loyalty. This term also occurs in 2:20b and 3:10b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">See Loyalty, kindness, or loyal love in the “Introduction to Ruth” for a further discussion of this key Hebrew word.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>as you have shown to your dead and to me:</strong> In this part of the blessing, Naomi used a comparison to describe the kindness that she wanted the LORD to show Orpah and Ruth. She compared it to the kindness that Ruth and Orpah had shown to her and to their husbands.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this comparison:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May the Lord be as kind to you as you were to me and to our loved ones who have died. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May the Lord show you the same kind of devotion that you have shown to your deceased husbands and to me! (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>your dead:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase is literally “the dead.” There are two ways to interpret this phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>This phrase refers to Mahlon and Kilion. Both of them were dead. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>May the Lord be as kind to you as you have been to me and my sons who are now dead. (NCV) <em>(BSB, NCV, NET, NIV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>This phrase refers to Elimelech, Mahlon and Kilion. All three of them were dead. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You were kind to my husband and sons, and you have always been kind to me. I pray that the Lord will be just as kind to you (CEV) <em>(CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Many versions are ambiguous as to the interpretation that they follow. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May Yahweh show you faithful love, as you have done to those who have died and to me. (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you translate this phrase in a way that allows either interpretation to be understood. However, if you need to choose one interpretation to follow, then it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with a majority of versions. The Hebrew text does not indicate that Orpah and Ruth ever had an opportunity to show kindness to Elimelech. He may have died before Orpah and Ruth met Mahlon and Kilion.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase probably refers to acts of kindness that Ruth and Orpah had shown to their husbands while they were still alive.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NICOT (pages 104–105) suggests that their kindness “in some unspecified way benefited the dead.” However, WBC (page 76) counters that here Naomi “refers to the faithfulness of Ruth and Orpah both to her and to these dear departed during the ten years (v4) of their married life together.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural to arrange the clause parts in chronological order. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You were kind to your husbands who have died, and to me. I pray that Yahweh will be kind to you in the same way.</p></blockquote>",

Ruth 1:1–2 introduces the first section in Ruth 1:3–5.</span></span> See the Note on 1:6b for more information.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples of section headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Naomi and Ruth Return to Bethlehem (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Naomi and Ruth Return (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Departure from Moab (GW)</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:9a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>May the LORD enable each of you to find rest in the home of your new husband.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I pray that Yahweh will give both of you<sup>(dual)</sup> security, each of you<sup>(sing)</sup> in the home of your<sup>(sing)</sup> husband.”</p></li><li><p>May Yahweh enable each of you<sup>(sing)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to remarry and</span> to have a happy home with your husband.”</p></li><li><p>May Yahweh bless you<sup>(plural)</sup> with new husbands. And may you have peace in your new homes.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>May the LORD enable each of you to find rest:</strong> This clause is a continuation of the blessing from 1:8b. The clause is more literally “May Yahweh give to you and find rest [each] woman.” The syntax is unusual. In Hebrew, the wish/prayer “May Yahweh give to you” has no object. Also, the verb <em>find</em> is a command form. There are two main interpretations of this clause:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The phrase “and find rest” is not a command. Rather, it is the object of the prayer “May Yahweh give to you.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>May the Lord grant <u>that each of you find security</u>. (NJPS) <em>(BSB, CEV, ESV, GNT, KJV, NABRE, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, NJB, NJPS, NLT, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The phrase “and find rest” is the consequence of the prayer “May Yahweh give to you.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>May the Lord repay each of you <u>so that</u> you may find security. (GW) <em>(GW)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>May the LORD enable:</strong> This phrase is a wish/prayer of Naomi. Here are some other ways to translate it:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May the Lord give (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May the Lord grant (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May the Lord bless you (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And may the Lord make it possible (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>each of you:</strong> This phrase makes explicit that Naomi’s wish/prayer is for the benefit of both of her daughters-in-law. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for each of you (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions leave the phrase <em>each of</em> implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May the Lord give you (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>rest:</strong> In Hebrew, this word means either “rest” or “resting place.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>TWOT #1323f.</span></span> Here it refers to a situation that is secure and free from anxiety “after wandering, uncertainty, and pain.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NICOT (page 105).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that you may each find happiness (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the security (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the home of your new husband:</strong> This phrase describes the kind of rest that Naomi wants for her daughters-in-law. The best way for a young widow to have security was to marry another husband.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to marry again and have a home (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>with a husband! (NJB)</p></blockquote><h4>1:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And she kissed them as they wept aloud</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Then Naomi kissed them farewell. And Orpah and Ruth <span data-bnType=\"implied\">began</span> to cry loudly</p></li><li><p>And when she gave each one a parting kiss <span data-bnType=\"implied\">on the cheek</span>, they wailed with many tears.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And she kissed them as they wept aloud:</strong> This clause describes Naomi’s gesture of farewell to her daughters-in-law before they parted ways.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to indicate the connection of 1:9b to the previous clauses. Either of these options is acceptable:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Indicate that this clause talks about the next action in the story. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>And</u> she kissed them farewell. (NJPS)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Then</u> she kissed them goodbye (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Indicate that this clause talks about the result of Naomi urging Orpah and Ruth to return to Moab and blessing them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>So</u> Naomi kissed them good-bye. (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>And she kissed them:</strong> This clause describes a leave-taking custom. She probably kissed them on both cheeks. This was a proper gesture of farewell in that culture. However, in some cultures, this kind of kiss may be considered to be improper or unusual.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this gesture:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Add a footnote to explain the meaning. Here is a possible footnote example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In that culture, a proper leave-taking gesture was to give a small kiss on both cheeks.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Make explicit the purpose of the gesture in a general way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then Naomi expressed a fond farewell to them</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Substitute a different gesture that has the same function in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then they embraced in farewell</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>as they wept aloud:</strong> This clause describes what happened when Naomi kissed them goodbye. The phrase <em>wept aloud</em> means that they wept/cried loudly.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are two ways to interpret the referents of the pronoun <em>they</em> in this clause:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Orpah and Ruth wept aloud. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but <u>they began weeping loudly</u>, <sup>10</sup><u>and said</u>, ‘No, we shall go back with you…” (NJB) <em>(BSB, CEV, GNT, NABRE, NIV, NJB, NJPS, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>All three women wept aloud. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and <u>they all</u> broke down and wept (NLT) <em>(NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions are ambiguous as to the interpretation that they follow. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with the majority of versions. Orpah and Ruth were distressed when Naomi kissed them good-bye, so they cried and told Naomi that they wanted to stay with her.</p>",

This is supported by some commentaries<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>UBS, WBC, NICOT.</span></span> and some English versions. Most versions, including the BSB, are ambiguous.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it grieves me very much for your sakes:</strong> There are three ways to interpret the phrase <em>it grieves me very much</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means that the situation <u>grieves Naomi more than her daughters-in-law</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My bitterness is much worse than yours (GW) <em>(CEV, GW, NASB, NIV, NLT, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means that the situation <u>grieves Naomi on account of her daughters-in-law</u>.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For your sakes I feel bitter that the Lord has inflicted such misfortune on me (REB) <em>(BSB, ESV, GNT, KJV, NJB, REB, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means that the situation grieves <u>Naomi too much to share her grief with her daughters-in-law</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For my intense suffering is too much for you to bear. (NET) <em>(NABRE, NCV, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This interpretation is followed by many English versions and fits the context well.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>grieves me:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>grieves me</em> is more literally “bitter to me.” The word “bitter” refers to an irritating, pungent taste. It is used figuratively to refer to an unpleasant experience.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>My bitterness is much worse than yours (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Life is harder for me than it is for you (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Your situations are bad…my situation is much worse (T4T)</p></blockquote><h4>1:13d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that the hand of the LORD has gone out against me.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>for Yahweh has turned against me.”</p></li><li><p>because Yahweh has opposed me.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the hand of the LORD has gone out against me:</strong> The phrase <em>the hand of the LORD</em> is a figure of speech. It indicates the power or ability of Yahweh to perform some action. Naomi was accusing <em>the LORD</em> of taking action against her, or at least using others to cause her difficulty.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate this clause:</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:13c–d</strong></h5><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Keep the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because the Lord himself has raised his fist against me (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the figure of speech.

Here is one way to do this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The LORD <span data-bnType=\"implied\">himself</span> has turned against me, so what has happened to me is even worse than what has happened to you.</p></blockquote></div>",

The BSB and many other English versions do this with the word <em>Now</em>. Used in this way, <em>Now</em> indicates a break in the sequence of actions from chapter 1. It is not a time word .</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Naomi had a relative on her husband’s side:</strong> The phrase <em>on her husband’s side</em> means that Boaz and Naomi were related because of her marriage with Elimelech. The text does not exactly explain the relationship between Boaz and Elimelech, but it was a close one (see 2:20). Boaz may have been a cousin to Elimelech. He was not a “brother” in the sense of having the same father and mother. Probably Boaz was about the same age as Elimelech would have been if he were still alive. Use the correct kinship term in your language for such a relationship.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who belonged to the family of her husband Elimelech (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>There was a cousin to the former/deceased husband of Naomi</p></blockquote><h4>2:1a-b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:1a-b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(combined/reordered)</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Now Naomi was related to a rich and respected/influential person through her deceased/former husband, Elimelech.

He was a rich and important person from the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">same</span> clan as Elimelech.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">In fact,</span> he was from the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">same</span> extended family. He was a respected man of outstanding/high character, and his name was Boaz.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a prominent man of noble character from the clan of Elimelech, whose name was Boaz:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>a prominent man of noble character</em> has a several possible meanings. It is literally “a mighty man of strength/wealth/ability/character.” Most often in the Hebrew Scriptures, the phrase describes a mighty warrior. But in the context of Ruth, it describes Boaz as an important and influential man in Bethlehem due to his wealth and good character.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a rich and important man (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a respected man of outstanding character</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a wealthy, prominent man (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>from the clan of Elimelech:</strong> Boaz was from the same extended family as Elimelech. The <em>clan of Elimelech</em> does not identify Elimelech as the head of the clan. Rather, Boaz and Elimelech shared a common ancestor. The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>clan</em> refers here to a unit smaller than a tribe (as in “tribe of Judah”) but larger than a immediate family of parents and children.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some commentators such as Bush (Word) and Campbell (Anchor Bible) suggest that the Hebrew word mišpāḥâ here refers to something larger than extended family. But the words clan and extended family are quite fluid and dependent on context to determine their relative size. A clan (or sub-clan) is a large extended family.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>from the same extended family as Elimelech</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:1a-b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">There is some repetition of information about Boaz. For example, saying that Boaz was a relative of Elimelech is similar to saying that he was from the same clan as Elimelech. In some languages, it may be more natural to combine and/or reorder some of this information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now there was a man named Boaz who was from the same clan as Naomi’s husband. He/Boaz was wealthy and respected.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">See 2:1a-b (combined/reordered) in the Display for another example.</p></div>",

Although she did not know it, the man who owned that field, Boaz, was a relative of Elimelech. Boaz had heard about Ruth already, but he had not met her.

Naomi was very pleased.

In some languages, it may be helpful to use a phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>One day, (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then,</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi:</strong> Here, <em>the Moabitess</em> means “the woman from Moab.” (See Ruth 1:4, 22.) The identification that Ruth is a Moabite occurs seven times in the book to draw attention to her being a foreigner.</p><h4>2:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Please let me go into the fields and glean heads of grain after someone in whose sight I may find favor.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“Allow me go to the field to glean stalks/ears of grain, gathering them behind anyone who shows me goodwill/favor.”</p></li><li><p>“<span data-bnType=\"implied\">I ask you to</span> permit me to go to the fields and pick up grain/barley that was not gathered by the harvesters. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I will look for</span> someone who is kind to me to let me follow him.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Please let me go into the fields:</strong> Ruth was asking Naomi for permission to go to the fields to glean. Use the form that younger women use to ask older women for permission to do something.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the fields:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>fields</em> is singular. It probably refers to the entire area where crops were planted near Bethlehem. Different people owned different parts of the area, with the boundaries probably marked by rows or piles of stones. You should use a term that refers to this general area where people plant their crops.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and glean heads of grain:</strong> In Hebrew, the expression that the BSB translates as <em>glean heads of grain</em> includes the technical verb “to glean.” (See “Gleaning and Harvesting” under “Important Cultural Items To Understand” in the Introduction for an explanation.) This refers to gathering grain that had fallen to the ground or that the reapers had not cut (intentionally or accidently). If your language does not have a specific word for “glean,” you may need to use a brief description. If you do use a descriptive phrase like this, you may want to use a shortened form of it for some of the later occurrences of “glean.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>gather the grain that the harvest workers leave (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>pick the grain left behind by the reapers (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>pick up the remaining stalks of grain</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>gather grain after the harvesters</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It may be helpful for you to insert a footnote here that explains that Old Testament law gave poor people the right to pick up grain that was left uncut or dropped. Here is a suggested footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Old Testament law gave instructions to not harvest all the grain in a field at harvest time. Poor people, strangers, widows, and orphans had the right to harvest this grain that was left so they would have food. See Leviticus 19:9–10 and Deuteronomy 24:19–22.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>heads of grain:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>heads of grain</em> refers to stalks of grain including the grain itself (also referred to in English as the “ear” of the grain; NRSV, for example, “the ears of grain”). If you have a specific term in your language for “stalks of grain” or “heads/ears of grain,” consider using it here. We know from Ruth 1:22 (and 2:22) that they were harvesting barley. If you don’t have a general word for grain, but have a word for barley (or similar grain like wheat), you could use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>after someone:</strong> The Hebrew preposition that the BSB translates as <em>after</em> refers to coming along behind the owner or his workers had completed cutting grain in an area to harvest it. This preposition can refer to either place or time. In this case, both are true. The gleaner worked in the field physically “behind” the other workers. In relation to time, he or she gleaned “after” the workers had finished harvesting grain and removed the bundles from that part of the field.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Commentaries consistently cite two books where the process of gleaning is described and this point is made: Dalman, <em>Arbeit und Sitte</em>, 3:46–47, 62, and Borowski, <em>Agriculture in Iron Age Israel</em>, 59–61.</span></span> But if your language does not have a preposition which can refer to both time or place in this way, choose one which refers to time, “after” the harvest workers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in whose sight I may find favor:</strong> The Hebrew idiom often translated “to find favor in [someone’s] eyes” means to receive approval, favor, or goodwill from a person. Since the LORD had commanded his people to allow poor people to glean, it was not necessary to ask permission. However, Ruth wanted to glean in a field where the owner would treat her kindly. Because she was a foreigner, she realized that some owners might not be pleased to have her glean in their fields and might not allow it, in spite of the law.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who shows me favor/goodwill</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who treats me kindly/well</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>anyone who is kind enough to let me do it (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who will permit me to do that</p></blockquote><h4>2:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Go ahead, my daughter,” Naomi replied.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Naomi answered her, “You may go, my daughter.”</p></li><li><p>Naomi replied, “<span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yes.</span> Go <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and do that</span>, my <span data-bnType=\"implied\">dear</span> daughter-in-law.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>“Go ahead, my daughter,” Naomi replied:</strong> The Hebrew command that the BSB translates as <em>Go ahead</em> simply means “Go.” Naomi was giving Ruth permission to do as she asked. Make sure your translation includes this idea of giving permission.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>my daughter:</strong> In some languages, it may be necessary to say “dear daughter-in-law.” Use the expression mothers-in-law use in your language to express affection to their daughters-in-law. See how you translated 1:11a.</p>",

She began to pick up grain/barley in a field behind the harvest workers.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So:</strong> After receiving permission from Naomi, Ruth went and began to glean. The BSB (and other English versions) connects 2:3 to 2:2 with the conjunction <em>So</em> to indicate that what Ruth did was as a result of what Naomi said in 2:2c (“Go”). Connect these verses in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Ruth departed and went out into the field and gleaned:</strong> Ruth left her home in the village and went out to the fields. She chose a field in which to work and started to gather the leftover grain there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>gleaned:</strong> See the translation advice at 2:2 under “and glean heads of grain.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>after the harvesters:</strong> This means that Ruth walked along picking up grain <em>after</em> and behind the workers who were harvesting the grain.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>harvesters:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>harvesters</em> refers to workers who cut or reap grain or grass using some type of cutting tool. The harvesters in Ruth’s time would have used a curved knife called a sickle. Here the term may be used to include all the workers who had a part in the harvest, both the cutters and those who followed behind to gather the cut grain.</p><h4>2:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It was by luck/chance that the field belonged to Boaz,</p></li><li><p>It so happened that she had entered a field whose owner was Boaz,</p></li><li><p>She did not know at that time that she was working/gleaning in a field that belonged to Boaz.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz:</strong> The Hebrew words that the BSB translate as <em>she happened to</em> are more literally “her chance chanced upon.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Bush (Word), Hubbard (NICOT) and Schipper (AY) all give this as the literal rendering in their commentaries.</span></span> Of the many fields in which she could have chosen to glean, Ruth happened to go to one that belonged to Boaz, a relative of her deceased father-in-law, Elimelech. From a human point of view, this was an accidental or unplanned event. It appears that Ruth did not know who owned the field in which she worked. At the same time, the reader of the book of Ruth can understand that God was behind the choice of field.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">You should translate this in a way that indicates that Ruth’s choice of this particular field was not intentional on her part.

He said to his harvest workers,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>Just then</em> functions to draw attention to someone or something significant in the narrative. Here it probably highlights the seeming coincidence of Boaz’s arrival. In verse 3, we learned that Ruth, by chance, went to glean at a field owned by Boaz. Now Boaz happened to arrive in person at the same time that Ruth was there. If you have a word that functions as an attention-getter, consider using it here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to draw attention to this event or to the person Boaz:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Now behold (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Boaz, as it happened,… (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and there was Boaz himself (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Apparently Boaz was coming from his home in the village to the field to check on his workers.

So Ruth’s words were reported as direct speech embedded in the speech of the foreman. Translate this in whatever way is natural in your language, using either direct or indirect speech.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to do this using indirect speech:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>She asked if she might glean…. (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>She asked me to let her follow the workers and gather grain. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves after the harvesters:</strong> There is a textual issue in this verse part:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Masoretic Text includes the words which the BSB translates as <em>among the sheaves</em>. Ruth either asked to gather <em>among the sheaves</em> or “into sheaves.” (See the note just below addressing the interpretation issue.) For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>She asked, ‘May I follow the harvesters and gather grain among the bundles?’ (NET) <em>(BSB, ESV, GW, KJV, NABRE, NASB, NET, NIV, NJB, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The words <em>among the sheaves</em> are omitted.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Support for this text is found in the Syriac and Vulgate translations.</span></span> Ruth only asked to follow after or behind the harvesters and gather grain. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>‘Please let me follow the workers cutting grain and gather what they leave behind.’ (NCV) <em>(CEV, GNT, NCV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions. This interpretation also has strong textual support.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The LXX also includes the words in question (<em>καὶ συνάξω ἐν τοῖς δράγμασιν</em>). HOTTP supports the MT reading with a B-rating. The inclusion of these words, and particularly if they are interpreted to mean “among the sheaves/bundles,” creates the difficulty of Ruth asking for special privilege in her gleaning. So, many scholars support the text that includes them as the more difficult reading. UBS recommends textual reading (2), but they seem to exaggerate the difficulty of the MT reading and the textual support for omitting the words “among the sheaves” (only the Syriac and Vulgate).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Normally in Jewish practice, gleaners were not permitted to begin to glean in a field until the harvesters had finished their work and removed their bundles of grain from the field. As a result, the Hebrew words that the BSB translates as <em>among the sheaves</em> have different emphases. Ruth may have wanted to gather grain into “sheaves/bundles” after the harvesters had finished their work. She may also have wanted to gather grain at the same time as the other women harvesters.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Bush (Word), in particular, makes a detailed and cogent case for “after the harvesters.” About Ruth he says: “Ruth was a stranger and a foreigner. It would be almost unthinkable for her to have requested the right to glean ‘among the sheaves,’ a right of gleanage that far exceeded anything accorded by custom to native Bethlehemites. It could have caused her only the ill will and enmity of all the other women whom circumstances (cf. Deut 24:19) had also driven to the exigencies of the poverty stricken.” Commentators who support versions like the NIV reinterpret the character of Ruth based on the assumption that she asks for special privilege in gleaning. They describe her as “courageous” and “brash” (Hubbard) or “resolute” and “stubborn” (Block).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this verse part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>‘I would like to gather the gleanings into sheaves after the harvesters.’ (NABRE)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>She asked me this morning if she could gather grain behind the harvesters. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>She said, ‘Please let me gather grain. I will only gather among the bundles behind the reapers.’ (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate in a way that shows that Ruth was being polite and humble. She was also determined to provide for the needs of Naomi and herself.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">You may want to include a footnote to explain that Ruth asked for a special privilege in gleaning that went beyond what was customary. Here is a suggested footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>While it is not stated specifically in the Old Testament, scholars believe that the custom was that gleaners could only glean in a field after the harvesters had completed their work and removed their bundles of grain. Ruth requested the special privilege to glean close to his woman workers at the same time as they were bundling the harvest.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>sheaves:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>sheaves</em> means stalks of grain that have been gathered into a “bundle.” A bundle was often the amount formed by filling the arms with stalks of grain. A sheaf is a bundle that has been tied or bound. Sheaves were left in the fields until they were gathered up and taken to the threshing floor.</p><h4>2:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So she came out and has continued from morning until now,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Since she arrived this morning, she has remained in the field <span data-bnType=\"implied\">working</span> all the time.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I permitted her to work/glean,</span> and she started to glean. She has continued from early morning until now.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So she came out and has continued:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>has continued</em> has a range of meaning including “stand, continue, remain.” In this context, it probably means that she “remained.” Many versions are ambiguous about where Ruth remained. The context seems to indicate that Ruth <em>continued</em> to work in the field after the foreman had given her permission to do so.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions make explicit what Ruth did in the field. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>She asked if she could pick up grain left by the harvest workers (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>She asked me to let her follow the workers and gather grain. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>from morning until now:</strong> This is literally “from then, the morning, and until now.” “From then” probably refers to the time when the foreman had talked to Ruth. He was saying that Ruth had stayed in their field and worked steadily at gleaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>She has been hard at work ever since (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>now:</strong> The workers had probably come early in the morning. It was later when Boaz came to see how they were doing. It may have been mid-morning, since the mealtime at midday mentioned in 2:14a seems to have been a little later.</p><h4>2:7c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:7c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>except that she rested a short time in the shelter.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>She has only rested for a short time in the shelter.”</p></li><li><p>However, she did stop for a few moments to sit in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the shade of</span> the hut.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">There are two textual issues in this part of the verse.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>except that she rested a short time:</strong> One textual issue has to do with the Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>except that she rested a short time</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Hebrew Masoretic text says that Ruth rested in the shelter for a short time (literally “a little”). That is, she worked for most of the morning but took a brief rest. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>except for a few minutes’ rest (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>She has stopped only a few moments to rest (NCV) <em>(BSB, ESV, GNT, GW, KJV, NABRE, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, NJB, NJPS, NLT, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The LXX (Septuagint) indicates that Ruth did <u>not</u> rest at all. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>without resting even for a moment (NRSV) <em>(CEV, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the shelter:</strong> The other textual issue has to do with the Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>in the shelter</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Masoretic text includes the word that the BSB translates as <em>in the shelter</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>except for a short rest in the shelter (NIV) <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, REB, NET, GW, NLT, NCV, KJV, NASB, NJPS)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Septuagint (LXX) does not include a word meaning “house” or <em>shelter</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>with hardly a rest (NJB) <em>(CEV, ESV, NABRE, NJB, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>shelter:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>shelter</em> (literally “house”) was probably a temporary building that provided shade for the harvest workers when they rested. Perhaps it was built with poles and had a roof made from leafy branches or straw. People in many cultures build some similar type of temporary shelter when their garden or field is not near their homes. If your language has a name for such a shelter, use it here.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NET note.</span></span></p>",

He told her that he had instructed the young men not to bother her. He also said that she should feel free to drink from the water jars that the young men had filled. Ruth asked Boaz why he was being so kind to her. He replied that he had heard about everything she had done for her mother-in-law.

You should use a term that shows respect and kindness from a man, older and more important, to a younger woman.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">One way to use the word <em>daughter</em> and avoid the literal meaning is to use a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You are like a daughter to me</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Although <em>daughter</em> may be appropriate in some languages, a different term such as “little sister” may be better in others.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may not be appropriate to use a kinship term at all because Boaz was only related to her by marriage. If it is not appropriate for you to use a kinship term, here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You are a woman whom I respect.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Dear young lady,</p></blockquote><h4>2:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Do not go and glean in another field, and do not go away from this place,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Do not go/leave to gather grain in any other field.

He did not want her to glean in any fields that belonged to other people. Notice that these two clauses have essentially the same meaning. This is good Hebrew style. The repetition adds emphasis to Boaz’s instruction that Ruth should glean only in his fields.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The verb form used in the second clause strengthens the meaning of the first. It may imply that Ruth should be sure not to cross boundary markers to go into someone else’s field.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Bush (Word) in particular argues for this sense. He appeals to the Hebrew conjunction <em>gam</em> ‘also’ which suggests the second command adds somehow to the first. He takes the view (together with other commentators) that Boaz “is granting her more than the ordinary rights of gleanage” by allowing her to glean so close to his women workers. This explains the stronger negative verb form used to say that Ruth must be careful not to go beyond the boundary markers. Bush further comments, “Boaz’s admonition is necessary since fields in the ancient Near East were separated by no clearly visible boundaries.” One more point in support of this view is the verb <em>‘avar</em> which often includes the sense of passing or crossing boundaries.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate these clauses:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Do not leave to gather grain in another field. You need not go beyond the limits of this field. (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Don’t gather grain anywhere except in this field.

This had two advantages for her. First, being close to the women who work for him would be a safe place for her. Second, it was probably an advantage and special privilege for Ruth to glean so close to the harvest workers.

Since Naomi and Ruth were poor at this time, Ruth asked Naomi for permission to glean in the grain fields in order to find them some food.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Ruth chose a field in which to glean. Although she did not know it, the man who owned that field, Boaz, was a relative of Elimelech. Boaz had heard about Ruth already, but he had not met her. He was sympathetic and kind to her that day, and told her to continue to work in his field during the rest of the harvest time.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">That evening, Ruth returned home and told Naomi that the owner of the field where she had gleaned was called Boaz and that he had treated her well. Naomi was very pleased. She encouraged Ruth to continue to work there just as Boaz had invited her to do.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples of section headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Ruth Meets Boaz (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Ruth Works in the Field of Boaz (NET)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1008002008\" data-endVerseId=\"1008002013\"><h3>Paragraph 2:8–13</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, Boaz told Ruth that she should stay and glean in his field along with his other women workers. He told her that he had instructed the young men not to bother her. He also said that she should feel free to drink from the water jars that the young men had filled. Ruth asked Boaz why he was being so kind to her. He replied that he had heard about everything she had done for her mother-in-law. He had also heard about her decision to leave her homeland and come to live with people she did not previously know.</p></div><h4>2:9a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Let your eyes be on the field they are harvesting, and follow along after these girls.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Observe carefully which field <span data-bnType=\"implied\">my</span> workers are harvesting, and follow close behind the female workers.</p></li><li><p>Follow right behind the women wherever you see <span data-bnType=\"implied\">my</span> harvesters working.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Let your eyes be on the field they are harvesting:</strong> The fields for the residents of Bethlehem were outside the village and one man’s field would be adjacent to that of another person. So Boaz instructed Ruth to watch carefully where his harvest crew was working and to stay with them. That is where she would be able to gather the most grain, and where she would be safest (2:9b).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>they are harvesting:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>they are harvesting</em> is literally “they (masculine) are harvesting.” Masculine gender in Hebrew can be used for a mixed group of men and women, so scholars have interpreted this in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to all the harvest workers including both men and women. In versions that translate with <em>they</em>, the referent will be understood as “the women who work for me” (2:8c.) For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Keep your eyes on the field they are reaping (NJPS)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Watch to see into which fields they go to cut grain and follow them. (NCV) <em>(BSB, ESV, NJB, KJV, NASB, NJPS, GNT, NCV, NLT; NRSV, NABRE)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NRSV and NABRE both use passive constructions which give attention to “the field that is being reaped” (NRSV) and leave implicit who the reapers are. This results in the reapers not being limited to one gender or the other.</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers only to the male workers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Take note of the field where the men are harvesting (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and follow along behind them, as they gather up what the men have cut (CEV) <em>(NIV, NET, REB, GW, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The Notes will follow interpretation (1) and use a word that can refer to all the harvest workers. However, both interpretations have good commentary support.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Commentaries that support interpretation (1) include: WBC, AYB, ZECOT, and NICOT. Commentaries that support (2) include: UBS, ZIBBC, KEL, and NET note.</span></span> It is clear that the men did the actual harvesting/reaping, whereas the women gathered and tied the stalks into bundles. You may follow whatever interpretation people will understand best in your culture.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and follow along after these girls:</strong> Boaz here granted Ruth the privilege of gleaning <u>close</u> to the women workers, not just <u>after</u> them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Stay <u>right behind</u> the young women working in my field. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>continue following <u>closely behind</u> my women workers (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>2:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Indeed, I have ordered the young men not to touch you.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Have I not commanded the young men not to harm you?</p></li><li><p>By my words, I am ordering my men <span data-bnType=\"implied\">workers</span> not to disturb/bother you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Indeed, I have ordered the young men not to touch you:</strong> In Hebrew, this statement is a rhetorical question. Boaz used it to emphasize the certainty of his instructions to the men. There are two ways to translate this question:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Have I not commanded the young men to <u>do you no harm</u>? (NABRE)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will tell the men to <u>leave you alone</u>. (NET)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>not to touch:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Hebrew verb in this context that the BSB translates as <em>to touch</em> :</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “to bother, harm, or treat roughly.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have ordered the young men not to <u>bother you</u>. (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have ordered the young men not to <u>treat you roughly</u>. (NLT) <em>(CEV, NABRE, NET, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It mean to come against a person violently or to abuse sexually. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have forbidden my men to molest you. (NJB) <em>(GNT, NAB, NJB, NJPS, REB, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Phrases such as “lay a hand on” (NIV) and <em>touch</em> (BSB) are ambiguous.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Notes will follow interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some feel that sexual assault is not in view in this context. CBC, for example, points out that this is harvest time and the fields were full of workers who could respond to a cry for help. KEL similarly finds it “highly unlikely that Boaz’s workers were so prone to attack women that he had to prohibit such an action!”</span></span> Boaz had given special permission to Ruth to glean close to his female workers. Without this command his male workers may have treated her roughly and told her that she could only glean after those workers were finished with their work.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, you should also fee free to follow interpretation (2). It is followed by a majority of versions and a number of scholars. Ruth 2:9 is mentioned specifically as one of the OT references where “touch a woman” is a euphemism for sexual intercourse.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Church of Christ study on 1 Corinthians 7, AYB7, IBC, Schwab. As IBC states: It is quite possible that any young woman working alone in the fields might be subject to unsolicited advances by men in the area…A foreigner from a disliked ethnic group would be even more likely to be victimized</span></span> It is unlikely that a man would molest Ruth in broad daylight, but someone might well attempt it in the evening as she walked home.</p><h4>2:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And when you are thirsty, go and drink from the jars the young men have filled.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>When you become thirsty, go and drink from the containers of water that the young men have filled.”</p></li><li><p>When you are thirsty, you may drink from the water jars that my <span data-bnType=\"implied\">my</span> servants have filled <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for themselves</span>.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And when you are thirsty, go and drink from the jars the young men have filled:</strong> Boaz was again granting Ruth a special favor. Normally, a gleaner would have to get her own water. She would not be allowed to drink from the water jars that the workers had filled for themselves.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the jars:</strong> These are not specified as water containers in the Hebrew text, but are just called “containers” or “vessels.” However, from the context it is clear that they were containers for water.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the young men have filled:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>have filled</em> refers specifically to drawing (pulling up) water from a well. In your translation, use the words that people in your culture normally use to describe filling their water containers.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the young men:</strong> The masculine plural noun that the BSB translates as <em>the young men</em> can refer to a mixed group of servants. So if it would seem strange to your readers that <em>men</em> would fill water jars, you may use a general term such as “servants” or “workers.”</p>",

In other languages, it may be natural to use a conjunction such as “So” or “Then.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>she fell on her face, bowing low to the ground:</strong> Ruth probably knelt down, then bowed forward until her forehead touched the ground. She was doing this to show respect and gratefulness.

See how you translated the similar phrase in 2:2b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Ruth was asking Boaz to tell her the reason why he would be so kind to her. This was a real, and not a rhetorical, question.

Perhaps several people had talked to him about her. In addition, the word <em>fully</em> is used. This indicates that Ruth’s actions had been explained to him in detail. Boaz had heard a lot about Ruth and what she had done for Naomi.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>People have told me about everything you have done for your mother-in-law (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I know about all the help you have given your mother-in-law (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I have been hearing all about your <span data-bnType=\"implied\">kind</span> actions to your mother-in-law</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I have been made fully aware:</strong> The verb phrase <em>I have been made fully aware</em> is passive in form. Boaz does not say who had told him about Ruth. There are at least two ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a passive verb.

This verse part begins an explanation of what exactly Ruth had done for her mother-in-law. She had left her own parents and her own land.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural to begin a new sentence here.

She had come to live in Israel among strangers. The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>a people</em> is a general word. It is contrasted with Ruth’s “land of…birth” of Moab in 2:11b, so here it refers to the people of Israel.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and came to live among people you did not know previously (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to come to a nation where you did not know anyone (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a people you did not know before:</strong> This clause indicates that Ruth had not known the Israelites well or personally before this time. Ruth had never lived in Israel before.

In the Book of Ruth, Boaz often speaks in long sentences. This seems to be part of the way that the author shows his character as a serious and dignified man. However, in some languages it may be better to translate this verse as two or three sentences. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>11a</sup>Boaz answered her, “People have told me about everything you have done for your mother-in-law since your husband died. <sup>11b</sup>They told me how you left your father and mother and the country where you were born. <sup>11c</sup>They also told me how you came to people that you didn’t know before….” (GW)</p></blockquote></div>",

(NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I ask</span> the LORD to reward you for what you have done.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>repay:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>repay</em> refers here to <u>doing good</u> to someone as a reward for a good action that that person has done.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>reward you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>do good to you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your work:</strong> Boaz was referring to the work, or actions, he had spoken of in 2:11b-c. These were good things, kind actions. In some languages, it may be necessary to make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for being <span data-bnType=\"implied\">good to your mother-in-law</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for your <span data-bnType=\"implied\">kind</span> deeds/actions</p></blockquote><h4>2:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and may you receive a rich reward from the LORD, the God of Israel,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>May Yahweh, the God of Israel, give you<sup>(sing)</sup> a rich/great reward.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I pray that</span> Yahweh, the God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">whom we<sup>(excl)</sup></span> Israelites <span data-bnType=\"implied\">worship</span>, will be very kind to you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>may you receive a rich reward from the LORD, the God of Israel:</strong> The Hebrew is more literally “May your wages be complete from Yahweh, the God of Israel.” This repeats the meaning of 2:12a but with greater emphasis.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and a full reward be given you by the Lord, the God of Israel (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May you receive a rich reward from the Lord God of Israel (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the LORD, the God of Israel:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>the LORD</em> is Yahweh, and the Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>God</em> is <em>ʾelohim</em>, the normal term for God. This sort of double expression is common in the Old Testament. How you translate it will depend on the term that you have chosen for Yahweh. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Lord God of Israel (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Yahweh, the God whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the people of</span> Israel <span data-bnType=\"implied\">serve/worship</span></p></blockquote><h4>2:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>under whose wings you have taken refuge.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He is the one</span> to whom you have come to find safety <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like a baby bird</span> under its <span data-bnType=\"implied\">mother’s</span> wings.”</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">For</span> he is the God whom you are trusting to protect you.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>under whose wings you have taken refuge:</strong> This is a metaphor. The picture is of a young bird seeking protection under the <em>wings</em> of its mother. Boaz meant that Ruth was relying on the LORD to protect her and care for her, just as a mother bird protects and cares for her young ones.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are several ways to translate this figure of speech:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>under whose wings you have come for refuge!” (NRSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to whom you have come for protection <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like a baby bird hiding</span> under <span data-bnType=\"implied\">its mother’s</span> wings.”</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Explain the meaning of the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to whom you have come to find protection/safety.”</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>from whom you have sought protection!” (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use another simile or metaphor from your language that means the same thing. Avoid referring to anything that Boaz could not have known or talked about.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>taken refuge:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>taken refuge</em> means “to go for protection” or “to seek a safe place.” This implies that Ruth was trusting the God of Israel to protect her.</p><p data-indent=\"3\">The Notes have used closed quote marks above to indicate that Boaz’ words to Ruth end with this verse part. Verse 2:13a continues this paragraph with Ruth’s response. In some languages, it may be easier for readers to identify a new speaker if there is a new paragraph.</p>",

Ruth used this form of address in order to express her respect for Boaz.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>she said:</strong> The BSB has placed this phrase in the middle of what Ruth was saying. You should place this speech introduction wherever it would be natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>may I continue to find favor in your eyes:</strong> The expression <em>find favor in your eyes</em> is an idiom that means to receive approval or goodwill from a person. This favor would normally be expressed in kind acts. See how you translated this idiom in 2:2b and 2:10b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is possible to understand this verse part in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Ruth was expressing a hope or a wish that Boaz would continue to be pleased with her and be kind to her. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I hope you will always look on me with favour (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I hope I can continue to please you, sir. (NCV) <em>(BSB, GW, KJV, NABRE, NCV, NIV, NJB, NLT, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Ruth was thanking Boaz for acting kindly toward her. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You are very kind to me, sir. (GNT) <em>(CEV, ESV, NASB, NET, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Ruth was respectfully expressing her desire that Boaz would continue to be pleased with her (and so be kind to her).</p><h4>2:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for you have comforted and spoken kindly to your maidservant,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“You<sup>(sing)</sup> have comforted and reassured your servant,</p></li><li><p>For you have been kind enough to encourage me, your servant,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for you have comforted and spoken kindly to your maidservant:</strong> This verse part indicates Ruth’s appreciation for what Boaz was doing. She was thanking Boaz for speaking in an encouraging and reassuring way to her.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You have comforted me by speaking so kindly to me (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You have said kind and encouraging words to me, your servant (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You have comforted me and reassured me (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and spoken kindly:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>spoken kindly</em> is literally “spoken upon the heart.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your maidservant:</strong> Here Ruth referred to herself in the third person. In many languages, you may need to make it explicit that Ruth was speaking about herself. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>me, your servant (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Ruth was not actually a servant in the same sense as the other servant girls. She was speaking in a humble and respectful way. It was common at that time to refer to oneself as someone’s “servant” in order to show respect for the other person.</p><h4>2:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>though I am not like one of your servant girls.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>even though I am not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">actually/even</span> one of your servants.”</p></li><li><p>although I am not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">even as important</span> as one/any of your servant women/girls.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>though I am not like one of your servant girls:</strong> Ruth said that she was not actually one of Boaz’s servants. She implied that she was less important than they were, and that he need not have noticed her. By speaking in this way, she was showing great humility.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>even though I am not one of your servants (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and I’m not even one of your own servants (GW)</p></blockquote>",

However, the majority of translations understand the words “at mealtime” to refer to the time when Boaz addressed Ruth.</span></span> It would probably have been about noon.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Come over here:</strong> Boaz invited Ruth to join his workers. The word <em>here</em> refers to the general area where Boaz and his hired workers, both males and females, were eating. You may wish to translate this as an invitation or as a polite command. Consider how a landowner or employer would speak kindly to his workers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You may come and join us</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Come, eat with us. (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>2:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>have some bread and dip it into the vinegar sauce.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You<sup>(sing)</sup> can dip <span data-bnType=\"implied\">your bread/food</span> in the vinegar sauce.”</p></li><li><p>He invited/encouraged her to take some bread and dip it in the sauce <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with them</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>have some bread:</strong> Again, this can be translated as an invitation or as a polite command. The Hebrew word meaning <em>bread</em> is used here to refer to the ordinary food served at the noon meal. Bread was the main food in Ruth’s time. If the speakers of your language do not eat bread every day and think of it as a special or luxury food, then use your own common word for “food.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and have some food (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and help yourself to some food (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and dip it into the vinegar sauce:</strong> Apparently the <em>vinegar sauce</em> was some kind of tasty sauce, probably fermented. Boaz was offering Ruth something that tasted good. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Dip your bread in the vinegar. (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You can dip your bread in the sour wine. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If people in your culture do not dip bread in a sauce, or if you have referred to food in general in the previous clause, you may need to translate this in a different way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Help yourself to the sauce.</p></blockquote><h4>2:14c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:14c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So she sat down beside the harvesters, and he offered her roasted grain,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>So she sat down beside the harvesters.

Here are some other ways to translate them:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So she sat down beside the harvesters. Then he handed her some roasted grain. (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So she sat beside the reapers, and he handed her some roasted grain. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>she sat down beside the harvesters:</strong> The harvesters, both men and women, were sitting eating together, and Ruth joined them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and he offered her roasted grain:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>offered</em> is not found anywhere else in the Old Testament. In this context, it seems to indicate that Boaz handed or gave Ruth some grain.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>roasted grain:</strong> This refers to fresh grain that the workers had roasted over the fire.

(NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the sheaves:</strong> The <em>sheaves</em> were bundles of cut grain.

An <em>ephah</em> was a basket of a standard size that the Israelites used for measuring and carrying dry materials.

The main point is that this was a very large amount for someone to glean in one day. You should make this clear in your translation. Apparently Boaz’s workers had obeyed his instructions and left extra stalks of grain for Ruth to pick up. She herself must have worked hard to obtain this large amount.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are several ways of translating the ancient measurement of <em>ephah</em>:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>You can transliterate the Hebrew word <em>ephah</em>.

Since Naomi and Ruth were poor at this time, Ruth asked Naomi for permission to glean in the grain fields in order to find them some food.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Ruth chose a field in which to glean. Although she did not know it, the man who owned that field, Boaz, was a relative of Elimelech. Boaz had heard about Ruth already, but he had not met her. He was sympathetic and kind to her that day, and told her to continue to work in his field during the rest of the harvest time.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">That evening, Ruth returned home and told Naomi that the owner of the field where she had gleaned was called Boaz and that he had treated her well. Naomi was very pleased. She encouraged Ruth to continue to work there just as Boaz had invited her to do.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples of section headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Ruth Meets Boaz (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Ruth Works in the Field of Boaz (NET)</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:20a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:20a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Then Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May he be blessed by the LORD,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Naomi responded to her daughter-in-law, “May Yahweh be kind/good to him!</p></li><li><p>Naomi said to her, “May Yahweh show him favor!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>May he be blessed by the LORD:</strong> Naomi again asked the LORD to bless Boaz.</p><h4>2:20b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:20b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who has not withdrawn His kindness from the living or the dead.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Yahweh has not stopped being kind to those who are living and those who have died.”</p></li><li><p>Yahweh is continuing to do kind things for <span data-bnType=\"implied\">us</span> who are alive and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">our husbands</span> who are dead.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who has not withdrawn His kindness from the living or the dead:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>withdrawn His kindness</em> is more literally “forsaken, abandoned.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are two interpretation issues in this clause. The first is whether <em>His kindness</em> is the object or the subject of the Hebrew clause. The possibilities are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><em>His kindness</em> is <u>the object</u> of the verb. According to this interpretation, “he” is the subject of the verb, and <em>kindness</em> is something that “he” has not abandoned or forsaken. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he has not abandoned his loyalty to the living or to the dead (NET) <em>(BSB, CEV, GNT, GW, KJV, NABRE, NASB, NET, NIV, NJB, NJPS, NLT, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p><em>His kindness</em> is <u>the subject</u> of the verb. According to this interpretation, God’s kindness has not abandoned or forsaken his people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whose kindness has not forsaken the living or the dead (NRSV) <em>(ESV, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The second issue is that in Hebrew it is not clear who <em>has not withdrawn His kindness</em>. Scholars have interpreted the clause in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><u>The LORD</u> is the subject of the verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>May he be blessed by the Lord, who never fails to show kindness to the living and to the dead. (NABRE) <em>(BSB, CEV, GNT, GW, KJV, NABRE, NASB, NCV, NJB, NJPS, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p><u>Boaz</u> is the subject of the verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>May he be rewarded by the Lord because he has shown loyalty to the living on behalf of the dead. (NET) <em>(ESV, NET, NIV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with the majority of English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>who has not withdrawn His kindness:</strong> The verb that the BSB translates as <em>withdrawn</em> is more literally “abandoned” or “forsaken.” Naomi was saying that the LORD was still being kind and faithful to her family. The LORD was showing his kindness through Boaz.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He has not stopped being kind</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He has not stopped acting kindly</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He has continued to act with kindness/faithfulness</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>His kindness:</strong> The Hebrew word <em>ḥesed</em> that the BSB translates as <em>kindness</em> means faithfulness, love, and loyalty. See also the note at 1:8d.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>from the living:</strong> The phrase <em>the living</em> here refers to Naomi and Ruth. The LORD had been kind to them by guiding Ruth to the field of a relative who was generous to her.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>or the dead:</strong> The phrase <em>the dead</em> here probably refers to Elimelech and his sons. Perhaps Naomi was already thinking that Boaz might act as a guardian-redeemer, marry Ruth, and so continue Elimelech’s family line. This would be considered a great kindness to Elimelech and his sons, who had all died.</p><h4>2:20c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:20c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Naomi continued, “The man is a close relative.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Naomi added/said, “That man, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Boaz</span>, is a close relative of ours.<sup>incl</sup></p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Then</span> Naomi continued, “The <span data-bnType=\"implied\">owner of the field</span> is in my husband’s clan,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Naomi continued:</strong> The phrase <em>Naomi continued</em> indicates that Naomi continued speaking to Ruth. She started to talk about Boaz directly. Use the words that are normal in your language to indicate that the speaker continued to speak but changed the topic slightly.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The man is a close relative:</strong> Naomi referred to Boaz as <em>The man</em>. In some languages, it might not be polite to refer to a wealthy relative as <em>The man</em>. You should translate this with words that indicate respect.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Boaz is a close relative (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>That gentleman/landowner is a close relative</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a close relative:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>a close relative</em> is literally “close/near to us.” It is clear from the context that Naomi was talking of kinship and family ties. Naomi refers to him as <em>a close relative</em> even though Boaz was a relative of her deceased husband. In some languages, it may be necessary to say “a close relative of our family/husbands.”</p><h4>2:20d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:20d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He is one of our kinsman-redeemers.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He is one of those responsible to care for our<sup>incl</sup> family.”</p></li><li><p>so he is a relative with the duty to help us.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He is one of our kinsman-redeemers:</strong> In Israel, close relatives had a responsibility to preserve the property and family name of those related to them. The closest relatives—a brother, uncle, or cousin—had the main responsibility. These closest relatives were called <em>kinsman-redeemers</em>. By using this special term, Naomi was saying that Boaz was one of the men who had a close enough family relationship to help both her and Ruth.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, a term such as “guardian/kinsman-redeemer” may be misunderstood, because most people will associate it with Christ’s role as the redeemer of sinners.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be necessary to translate <em>kinsman-redeemers</em> with a phrase that clarifies the meaning in the context of this book. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>one of those who is supposed to look after us (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>one who should take care of us (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>one of those responsible for taking care of us (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>one of those who have responsibility to care for our family</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a relative with the duty to help us</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It is suggested that you use one or more of the above examples where the phrase <em>kinsman-redeemer</em> occurs in the source line. In this verse part, Naomi is speaking to Ruth, so the inclusive pronoun “us” is used. In other contexts, such as where Ruth speaks to Boaz, the exclusive pronoun should be used.</p>",

This fourth section tells how Naomi wanted to find a new husband for Ruth so that she could have a better living situation. So, she instructed Ruth to go and meet Boaz secretly at night. Ruth followed Naomi’s plan and asked him to take her into his care as his wife. She told him that this was his duty as a relative of her dead husband.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Boaz was happy to do this, but there was a problem. There was another relative who was more closely related to Naomi and Ruth than he was. If that man did not want to marry Ruth, Boaz promised that he would marry her. When Ruth returned home and told Naomi what had happened, Naomi assured her that Boaz would work hard to take care of the situation that very day.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples of a heading for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Naomi’s Plan for Ruth’s Marriage (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Ruth and Boaz at the Threshing Floor (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Ruth asked Boaz to marry her</p></blockquote></div><h4>3:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>One day Ruth’s mother-in-law Naomi said to her,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, (ESV)</p></li><li><p>¶ Some time later Naomi said to Ruth, (GNT)</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>One day:</strong> In Hebrew, this chapter begins with a conjunction that introduces a new major event in the story. Some versions do not use a conjunction or time phrase here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to introduce this event:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Then (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Some time later (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>After a while</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Consider the natural way in your language to introduce a new major event in the story. If you use a word or phrase that refers to a period of time, be sure that it can refer to an indefinite amount of time, perhaps a few weeks. By this time, the barley harvest was finished.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Ruth’s mother-in-law Naomi:</strong> In Hebrew, this phrase is literally “Naomi her mother-in-law.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>her mother-in-law Naomi (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Naomi, Ruth’s mother-in-law (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Naomi (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Ruth is such an important character in this story that the author did not think it was necessary to mention her here by name. Instead, the Hebrew text only refers to her by the pronoun “her.” But Naomi is mentioned both by her name and by her relationship to Ruth, because Naomi is about to do something important in the story. These different ways of referring to the main characters in the story follow the pattern of Hebrew stories.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it will not be necessary or natural to refer to Naomi here by both her name and her relationship to Ruth as <em>mother-in-law</em>. If this is true in your language, consider following the CEV and some others by simply referring to her as <em>Naomi</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>said to her:</strong> This clause introduces a direct quotation of Naomi to Ruth.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be natural to mention Ruth by name. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>said to Ruth (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In other languages, it may already be obvious whom Naomi is talking to, so it would not be necessary to use any form of reference. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Naomi then said (NJB)</p></blockquote><h4>3:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“My daughter, should I not seek a resting place for you, that it may be well with you?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“My daughter-in-law, should I not look for a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">suitable/permanent</span> home for you, so you can have all you need?</p></li><li><p>“Dear Ruth, I think that I should arrange for you to have a better <span data-bnType=\"implied\">life in the future</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>My daughter:</strong> Ruth was not Naomi’s daughter, but the word that the BSB translates as <em>My daughter</em> is a natural way for mothers-in-law to address daughters-in-law in Hebrew culture. It expresses Naomi’s affection for Ruth. You should translate these words the same way as in 2:2c.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate these words:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Daughter (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">My</span> daughter-in-law</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">My dear</span> daughter</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">My</span> child</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural for Naomi to not use any form of address to Ruth. The CEV and GNT do not include an explicit translation of these words.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this form of address in a way that is natural and appropriate in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>should I not seek a resting place for you, that it may be well with you?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. It emphasized the responsibility she felt to find a better living situation for Ruth.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are two ways to translate this rhetorical question:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a <u>rhetorical question</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>should I not try to find a home for you, where you will be well provided for? (NIV84)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Is it not my duty to see you happily settled? (NJB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I must find a suitable home for you (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it’s time that I found a permanent home for you (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I must find a husband for you, so that you will have a home of your own. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I think I should try to arrange for you to have a husband who will…provide for you. (T4T)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>seek:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>seek</em> means “search out.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a resting place for you:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>resting place</em> is literally “rest” or “place of rest.” But here it is a figure of speech that means “a secure future.” See how you translated the related word “rest” in 1:9.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Naomi wanted Ruth to have a quiet, settled, permanent situation in which to live the rest of her life. Such a situation could only come about through marriage. Naomi’s use of the phrase <em>resting place</em> here is an <u>indirect reference to marriage</u>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Naomi seemed to deliberately avoid being explicit, so you should keep the reference to marriage indirect if possible. Translate this phrase in a natural and meaningful way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>that it may be well with you:</strong> The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as <em>that it may be well with you</em> is literally “which will be good for you.” In this context, it refers to being in a good, secure situation, with a husband who will provide the food, clothes, and home she needed.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Most versions translate this part of 3:1b as a purpose clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that it may be well with you (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that you will be taken care of (CSB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that will be good for you (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so you will be secure (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It may be more natural in some languages to combine the two phrases “a resting place for you” and <em>that it may be well with you</em> into one phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a good home for you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a better life for you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the future</span></p></blockquote>",

(GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>tonight:</strong> This word could be translated as “this night” or “this very night.” Naomi was probably referring to the late afternoon and early evening. You should not translate this in a way that implies that Boaz would have worked for a long time after dark.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This evening (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Late this afternoon</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he is winnowing barley on the threshing floor:</strong> This clause describes one of the steps in the preparation of harvested <em>barley</em>. The term <em>threshing floor</em> refers to an open area with a hard level surface where harvested barley plants were crushed or “threshed.” The next step was <em>winnowing</em>. It refers to the work of separating the edible barley grain from its waste material or “chaff.” See the notes below for a more detailed explanation of these steps.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He will be separating the barley from its husks on the threshing floor (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he will be working at the threshing floor (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he will be separating barley seeds from the chaff at the place where they crush the grain</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">To translate this clause well, it is important to understand how harvested barley was prepared. When harvesters took bundles of barley from the field, they brought it to the <em>threshing floor</em> and did two things:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><u>Threshing</u>: The first thing they did with harvested barley was to “thresh” it. The workers “threshed” grain by beating or crushing it. This crushing process caused the heads or clusters of grain to break off from the stems of the plant, and the husks which contain the edible seeds would crack open.</p></li><li><p><u>Winnowing</u>: The people who winnowed the barley used a tool (shovel, fork, fan, or shallow basket) to pick up a bunch of crushed grain. They would then shake the grain and throw it up in the air. A gentle wind would blow the chaff and dust a distance away, and the heavier grain seeds would fall close by, where they were collected in heaps.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">There are several options to translate the term <em>winnowing</em>:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>If there is no word in your language for <em>winnowing</em>, use a short phrase that describes the process. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he will be separating the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">seeds/kernels of</span> barley <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from the chaff/husks</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a more general term such as “working.” See the NCV example above.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Naomi implied that after Boaz had finishing winnowing the grain, he would stay the whole night at the threshing floor, probably so that he could guard it.

It begins a series of instructions from Naomi to Ruth. So far, Naomi’s speech to Ruth which began in 3:1b has been describing a situation. Here in 3:3a she switched to giving instructions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to introduce the series of instructions:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So… (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Now do as I tell you (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Therefore I want you to…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You should… (CEB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Consider the way that your language naturally switches from describing the important facts about a situation to giving instructions.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>wash yourself, put on perfume:</strong> Naomi told Ruth to <em>wash yourself</em>, which means to bathe. The verb which the BSB translates as <em>put on perfume</em> means to “anoint” or “apply oils or perfumes to the body.” Perfumed oil was a luxury item. Poor people would have used it only on special occasions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So bathe yourself, rub on some perfumed oil (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>take a bath and put on perfume (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and wear your best clothes:</strong> The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as <em>and wear your best clothes</em> is literally “and you will put your clothing on yourself.” There is no Hebrew word that means <em>best</em> here, but many translations supply a description of the clothes as “best,” “nice,” or “good,” because it fits the context.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>clothes:</strong> There is a textual issue here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>In some Hebrew manuscripts the word for <em>clothes</em> is plural and refers to clothing in general. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and put on your best <u>clothes</u> (NRSV) <em>(BSB, CEV, GNT, GW, KJV, NET, NIV, NABRE, NASB, NRSV, NCV, NLT, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>In other Hebrew manuscripts and in the LXX, the word for <em>clothes</em> is singular, referring specifically to a “cloak,” “robe,” or “outer garment.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and put on your <u>cloak</u> (ESV) <em>(ESV, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1) along with most versions. Also, it has strong manuscript support.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and dress in your nicest clothes (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and get dressed up (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>dress up (NJPS)</p></blockquote><h4>3:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Go down to the threshing floor,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Then go over to the threshing place,</p></li><li><p>Then <span data-bnType=\"implied\">get up and</span> go to the place where they remove the chaff/husks from the barley grain.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Go down to the threshing floor:</strong> Bethlehem was built on a hill that is higher than the surrounding land. A person would need to <em>Go down</em> to get to any place nearby. Threshing floors were also located on the tops or ridges of hills in order to catch good wind for blowing away the chaff. The <em>threshing floor</em> where Boaz worked was probably on the top of a lower hill close to Bethlehem.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may not be natural to say “go down” if a person goes slightly downhill.

Here in 3:3c, she gave a negative command, telling Ruth what not to do. The Hebrew text does not use any conjunction here. In many languages, it will be natural to use a conjunction that indicates contrast.

This fourth section tells how Naomi wanted to find a new husband for Ruth so that she could have a better living situation. So, she instructed Ruth to go and meet Boaz secretly at night. Ruth followed Naomi’s plan and asked him to take her into his care as his wife. She told him that this was his duty as a relative of her dead husband.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Boaz was happy to do this, but there was a problem. There was another relative who was more closely related to Naomi and Ruth than he was. If that man did not want to marry Ruth, Boaz promised that he would marry her.

This word introduces the dramatic event that leads up to this climax.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For an explanation of the use of this Hebrew word (<em>wayəhî</em>) to introduce an event that leads to the climax of a story, see Van der Merwe (page 332, section 44.5.1.i.b).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some ways to begin this sentence:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Suddenly (LB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Just then</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now it happened…that (NKJV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The BSB and most English versions do not translate this word here. But you should consider how your language naturally leads up to the main event or climax of a story.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>At midnight:</strong> This phrase refers to an approximate time around midnight. The Hebrew language and culture did not divide the night hours into exact units.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Around midnight (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In the middle of the night (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>During the night (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Boaz was startled:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>Boaz was startled</em> is literally “the man trembled.” The verb that means “tremble” usually refers to shaking from fear. The text does not say what made Boaz “tremble,” but the most likely reason was the cold air on his feet. And this is exactly what Naomi had planned.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he woke up suddenly (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the man was shivering (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the man was startled (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Boaz suddenly woke up (NLT96)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If the options in your language for translating “trembled” force you to be specific about why Boaz trembled, it should be from the cold rather than from fear.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Boaz:</strong> As in 3:3c, you may translate this phrase literally as “the man,” use the pronoun “he,” or refer to Boaz by name.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>turned over:</strong> The word which the BSB translates as <em>turned over</em> is rare in the OT, so scholars are not sure what it means. There are four ways to interpret this word:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>he turned</u> or <u>rolled over</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and turned over (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and he rolled over (NCV) <em>(BSB, ESV, GNT, GW, KJV, NCV, NET, NIV, NLT, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>he groped around</u> (for his covers). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>groped about (NABRE)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>reached out <em>(NABRE)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Interpretation (2) is also supported by LEB and Block (page 179).</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>he looked all around</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>looked about him (NJB) <em>(NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>he sat up</u> or <u>bent forward</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>bent forward (NASB) <em>(NASB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions.</p><h4>3:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and there lying at his feet was a woman!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and discovered a woman lying at his feet.

In Hebrew, this clause begins with a phrase that means “and behold.” The BSB does not use words to translate this phrase, but the exclamation mark (!) at the end of the sentence helps to match this dramatic and lively Hebrew expression.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and Look!

(ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your servant:</strong> When Ruth referred to herself as <em>your servant</em>, she spoke in a <u>figurative</u> way. She did not literally mean that she was his slave or servant.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>3:9 + Many commentators discuss here the slight difference in meaning between these two Hebrew words for a female <em>servant</em>. Both terms could be used by a woman to address someone with respect. But the word used here implies a slightly higher social status than the one used in 2:13 and it can imply that Ruth was available to Boaz as a wife or concubine.</span></span> Ruth used this figure of speech to indicate her respect and humility to someone who had higher status than herself.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are two options to translate this figure of speech:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the literal meaning of the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am Ruth, your servant girl (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a term of respect that expresses the meaning of the figure of speech.

In 9c Ruth made an <u>appeal</u> or request to Boaz, and in 9d she gave the <u>basis</u> or reason for that appeal. In many languages, it will be more natural to reorder these clauses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>9d</sup>You are a kinsman-redeemer of our family, <sup>9c</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">so</span> spread the corner of your garment over me.</p></blockquote></div><h4>3:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Spread the corner of your garment over me,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Cover <span data-bnType=\"implied\">me,</span> your servant, with the edge of your robe/covering,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Please</span> take me into your care/protection <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as your wife</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Spread the corner of your garment over me:</strong> This clause is a Hebrew idiom with a double meaning. The figurative meaning of the idiom is “marry me” or “take me as your wife.” However, the literal meaning (expressed in the BSB) also fits this context. (See the note and footnote under <em>corner of your garment</em> below.) With this statement, Ruth was asking for two things. She wanted Boaz to take her as his wife, and she also wanted him to cover her up from the cold night air.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some options to translate this idiom:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate the <u>literal meaning</u> and put the figurative meaning in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So spread the edge of your cover over me. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>FOOTNOTE: In Hebrew, these words have another meaning, which is, “Look after me as your wife.”</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the <u>figurative meaning</u> and put the literal meaning in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Please</span> marry me.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>FOOTNOTE: In Hebrew she said, “Cover me with the edge of your robe/blanket.” But these words have another meaning which is, “Look after me as your wife.”</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a short clause that expresses <u>both the literal and figurative meaning</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Spread the edge of your robe over me to show that you will marry me.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this clause in a natural and meaningful way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Spread…over me:</strong> This means “cover me with” or “stretch out over me.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the corner of your garment:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>the corner of your garment</em> refers to the “edge,” “boundary,” or “corner” of a blanket, covering, or item of clothing. This Hebrew word has a double meaning which is important in this context. It can also refer to the “wings” of a bird or animal. This was a figure of speech that referred to care and protection, like a young bird seeking protection under the “wings” of its mother.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>With this meaning, the whole idiom would be expressed literally as, “Spread your <u>wings</u> over me” (similarly as ESV). In 2:12b Boaz spoke to Ruth with a similar figure of speech, “under whose <u>wings</u> you have come to take refuge.” There, the Lord’s “wings” were a figurative reference to his care and protection for Ruth in a lasting relationship. Here Ruth was asking Boaz for care and protection in a lasting relationship of marriage. In ancient Hebrew culture, when one spoke of a man covering a woman with his “wings” (or edge of his robe), it meant that he was promising to take her into his protection and care as a wife (Block, page 180, and Bush, pages 164–165). See also Ezekiel 16:8.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>me:</strong> In Hebrew, Ruth spoke of herself to Boaz here as “your servant.” She did not use the pronoun <em>me</em>. This is the same word for “servant” that she used to refer to herself in 3:9b. See the note there. In both places, she used this word as a figure of speech to show humility and respect to Boaz.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If referring to yourself as someone’s “servant” is a natural or possible way in your language to show respect, consider saying it that way here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Spread out your robe over your servant. (CEB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If your audience would assume that Ruth meant that she was a literal servant to Boaz, you should follow the BSB and some other translations by using the pronoun <em>me</em>.</p><h4>3:9d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:9d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for you are a kinsman-redeemer.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because you are a relative who is responsible to care for our<sup>(excl)</sup> family.”</p></li><li><p>for you are one of my <span data-bnType=\"implied\">husband’s</span> relatives. And you have a duty to help our family.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for:</strong> The Hebrew conjunction which the BSB translates as <em>for</em> means “because.” Here it introduces a basis or reason for the request that Ruth made to Boaz in 9c. If you are reordering 9c–d as described in the General Comment above, it may not be necessary to include an explicit translation of this conjunction.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you are a kinsman-redeemer:</strong> See the notes on 2:20d. The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>kinsman-redeemer</em> refers to someone who was responsible to defend and protect the rights of needy relatives, including widows. Ruth reminded Boaz that this was his duty because he was a close relative of her dead husband.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you are the relative who is supposed to take care of me (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>one of those who have responsibility to care for our family</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Because you are a close relative, you are responsible for taking care of me. So please marry me. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you have a duty to help/protect our<sup>(excl)</sup> family</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 2:20d and use a similar expression here.</p>",

She had approached only someone who could act as Naomi’s kinsman-redeemer.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the younger men:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>the younger men</em> has the definite article as part of the word.

This fourth section tells how Naomi wanted to find a new husband for Ruth so that she could have a better living situation. So, she instructed Ruth to go and meet Boaz secretly at night. Ruth followed Naomi’s plan and asked him to take her into his care as his wife. She told him that this was his duty as a relative of her dead husband.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Boaz was happy to do this, but there was a problem. There was another relative who was more closely related to Naomi and Ruth than he was. If that man did not want to marry Ruth, Boaz promised that he would marry her.

This fourth section tells how Naomi wanted to find a new husband for Ruth so that she could have a better living situation. So, she instructed Ruth to go and meet Boaz secretly at night. Ruth followed Naomi’s plan and asked him to take her into his care as his wife. She told him that this was his duty as a relative of her dead husband.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Boaz was happy to do this, but there was a problem. There was another relative who was more closely related to Naomi and Ruth than he was. If that man did not want to marry Ruth, Boaz promised that he would marry her.

Then it describes what they did when they first woke up.</p></div><h4>3:14a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:14a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So she lay down at his feet until morning,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ So she lay by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Boaz’s</span> feet until <span data-bnType=\"implied\">nearly</span> sunrise,</p></li><li><p>¶ So <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Ruth</span> slept near <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Boaz’s</span> feet until the night was ending.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So she lay down at his feet:</strong> The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>So</em> introduces what Ruth did in response to what Boaz told her in 3:13.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Because this is the beginning of a new paragraph, it may be appropriate to identify the participants by name here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So Ruth stayed near his feet until morning (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Ruth lay beside Boaz’s feet… (EASY)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>until morning:</strong> From the statement in 3:14b, it is obvious that Ruth got up before the sun arose. Use a suitable word that can indicate a time very early in the morning, even before the sun rises.</p><h4>3:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but she got up before anyone else could recognize her.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but she got up while it was still too dark <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for people</span> to see one another’s faces.</p></li><li><p>But she got up before <span data-bnType=\"implied\">there was enough light</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for a person</span> to recognize someone else.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but she got up before anyone else could recognize her:</strong> In some languages, it will be necessary to explain why people could not recognize one another. They could not recognize one another because it was still too dark to see well. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but she got up before it was light enough for her to be seen (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But she got up and left before it was light enough that people would be able to recognize her (T4T)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but rose before it was light enough for one man to recognize another (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>She got up while it was still dark, before it was light enough for people to recognize each other. (ERV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">A few translations just translate the meaning that it was still dark. They leave implied the idea that people could not recognize others. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>She woke up while it was still dark. (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but she got up before daylight (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>before anyone else could recognize her</em> is more literally “before one could recognize his companion.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>She rose before one person could distinguish another (NJPS)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Then she got up before anyone could see her. (EASY)</p></blockquote><h4>3:14c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:14c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Then Boaz said, “Do not let it be known that a woman came to the threshing floor.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Boaz thought, “No one should find out that this woman came <span data-bnType=\"implied\">here</span> to this place for threshing.”</p></li><li><p>And Boaz said to himself that no one should know that Ruth was there at the area for threshing grain.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Then Boaz said:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>said</em> can be used in some cases for a person speaking to himself (thinking). Therefore, there are two ways to interpret 3:14c:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>This is something Boaz thought. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for he thought (NJPS) <em>(GW, NET, NCV, NJB, NJPS, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>This is something Boaz said aloud. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for Boaz had said (NABRE) <em>(BSB, CEV, ESV, GNT, KJV, NABRE, NASB, NIV, NLT, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>UBS (page 57), WBC, ZECOT.</span></span> If Boaz were talking aloud to Ruth, he would probably not refer to her in the third person, especially as “the woman” (see below).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Boaz thought (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And Boaz said to himself</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>“Do not let it be known that a woman came to the threshing floor.”:</strong> There is a textual issue concerning the Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>a woman</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Masoretic Text (Hebrew) has “the woman.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“People in town must not know that <u>the woman</u> came here to the threshing floor.” (NCV) <em>(CEV, ESV, GNT, GW, NABRE, NASB, NCV, NJB, NJPS, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Septuagint (LXX) has “a woman.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“No one must know that <u>a woman</u> visited the threshing floor.” (NET) <em>(BSB, KJV, NET, NIV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). There is no reason to doubt the accuracy of the MT. Boaz was worried about the reputation of Ruth, not the reputation of any woman.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The BSB does not follow interpretation (1) for either of the above issues, so the NJB has been used as an alternate Source Line in the Display.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>“Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.” (NJPS)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>“I hope that no one will ever know that this woman came to the threshing floor.” (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it might be better to use an indirect quotation to report what Boaz thought. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Boaz had it in mind that no one should know that the woman had been to the threshing-floor. (REB)</p></blockquote>",

It must have been fairly large and strong enough to carry a large amount of grain in it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>hold…out</em> also means “seize” or “grip (tightly).” The shawl was only a large piece of cloth, and not a bag. So Ruth would have to hold it firmly on the corners as Boaz poured the grain to prevent it from spilling.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Hold out the shawl you are wearing and grip it tightly. (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Bring me your shawl and hold it open. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Stretch out the cape you’re wearing and hold it tight. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural to use an indirect quotation here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Then he told her to bring her shawl and hold it firmly.</p></blockquote><h4>3:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>When she did so, he shoveled six measures of barley into her shawl.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>While she held it <span data-bnType=\"implied\">tightly</span>, he poured six measures of barley into her shawl, and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">then</span> he placed it on her.</p></li><li><p>Ruth gripped <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the corners of</span> her shawl, and Boaz poured about thirty (30) kilograms of barley into it. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Then</span> he lifted it onto her <span data-bnType=\"implied\">head</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>When she did so:</strong> This clause is more literally “And she held it.” In some languages, you may want to make explicit what she did as in the Hebrew. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As she held it tightly (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So Ruth held her shawl open (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So she held it tight while (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he shoveled six measures of barley:</strong> The Hebrew of this clause is more literally “He measured (out) six (of) barley.” It means that Boaz measured the barley as he put it in Ruth’s shawl. The text does not say what measuring container or unit was used. However it is clear that this was a generous amount but not too much for a strong young woman to carry alone. Most scholars think it was around thirty kilograms (sixty-five pounds).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you can, use a special unit of weight that can be used for grain, such as rice. Then use the number of units that will make a total of about thirty kilograms. If you do not have a special unit of weight for grain, you may translate <em>six measures</em> as “Thirty (30) kilograms” or “sixty-five (65) pounds.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and he measured six measures of barley (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he poured about 30 kilograms of barley into her shawl</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He poured more than fifty pounds of barley into it (NIrV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And he filled it with a lot of grain (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>into her shawl:</strong> Women at that time often carried heavy loads on their heads. Sometimes they needed help to get a very heavy load into position to carry it. Boaz helped her lift this heavy weight and get it properly balanced on her head, or possibly on her back or shoulders.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Boaz then put it on her head (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and placed it on her back (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and helped her lift it to her shoulder (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>3:15c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:15c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Then he went into the city.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>After that, he returned to the town.</p></li><li><p>Then <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Boaz left the threshing floor and</span> went into town.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Then he went into the city:</strong> There is a textual problem with this verse:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Masoretic Text has “<u>he</u> went into the town.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then he returned to the town.

The size of the gift showed that Boaz was concerned for Naomi and Ruth’s welfare.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you can communicate this emphasis in your language, then you should do so. One way to show the emphasis is to add a word like “all.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>She also said, “He gave me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all</span> these six measures of barley.”</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>She said to Naomi, ‘He also gave me all this barley.

Ruth was telling Naomi exactly what Boaz said. In many languages, it will be necessary to translate this as indirect speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Boaz said that I should not return to you without bringing <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a gift</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>empty-handed:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>empty-handed</em> is the same word that the BSB translates as “empty” in 1:21a. There, Naomi said that the LORD had brought her back to Israel empty. She meant that her husband and sons had died and she was poor. If you can translate the word the same in both verses, it would be good. However, in some languages it may necessary to say here that Boaz wanted Ruth to return with something, or with hands full of grain. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Do not return to Naomi with nothing to give to her. (EASY)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He said that I must not go home without bringing a gift for you. (ERV)</p></blockquote>",

This fourth section tells how Naomi wanted to find a new husband for Ruth so that she could have a better living situation. So, she instructed Ruth to go and meet Boaz secretly at night. Ruth followed Naomi’s plan and asked him to take her into his care as his wife. She told him that this was his duty as a relative of her dead husband.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Boaz was happy to do this, but there was a problem. There was another relative who was more closely related to Naomi and Ruth than he was. If that man did not want to marry Ruth, Boaz promised that he would marry her. When Ruth returned home and told Naomi what had happened, Naomi assured her that Boaz would work hard to take care of the situation that very day.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples of a heading for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Naomi’s Plan for Ruth’s Marriage (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Ruth and Boaz at the Threshing Floor (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Ruth asked Boaz to marry her</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1008003016\" data-endVerseId=\"1008003018\"><h3>Paragraph 3:16–18</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">This paragraph tells what happened when Ruth went back to Naomi. Ruth told her what had happened and about the barley. Naomi told her to wait for Boaz to act.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, the author does not give the names of the people involved, but uses pronouns. Some names have been included in many English versions as implied information from the context. In your translation, you may also need to name the individuals so that your readers can better understand the story.</p></div><h4>3:18a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:18a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Wait, my daughter,” said Naomi, “until you find out how things go,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Then Naomi said, “Just wait<sup>(sing)</sup>, my daughter<span data-bnType=\"implied\">-in-law</span>. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Be patient</span> until you know the outcome of this situation.</p></li><li><p>Naomi said, “Be patient, dear child, until you hear what will happen.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>“Wait, my daughter,” said Naomi, “until you find out how things go:</strong> This verse part indicates that Naomi wanted Ruth to be patient until there was more news. She did not need to leave their home to seek news about Boaz’s actions, or to do anything more herself.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>how things go</em> refers to the results of what Boaz said that he would do. Naomi was referring to whether Boaz or the other redeemer would act as the kinsman-redeemer and marry Ruth.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this verse part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Naomi said to her, “Now be patient, Ruth, until you see how this all turns out. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Then Naomi answered, “Child! We must wait until we know what will happen <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when Boaz talks with the other relative</span>.</p></blockquote><h4>3:18b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:18b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for he will not rest unless he has resolved the matter today.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>That man will not stop working until this situation is resolved, this very day.”</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You can be patient,</span> because Boaz will keep working to make an agreement today about what will happen.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>for</em> introduces a reason clause and is often translated as “because.” Naomi told Ruth that she should be patient, because Boaz would most certainly do what he said that he would do. However, the idea of reason is not very strong here, so in some languages, it may be more natural to omit it.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he will not rest:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>he</em> refers to Boaz, so you could also use his name.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The expression <em>will not rest</em> is used here as a figure of speech. Naomi believed that Boaz would keep trying to settle this matter and would not stop until he did so.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that man will not stop</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Boaz will surely do what he needs to do (EASY)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>unless he has resolved the matter today:</strong> This clause means that Boaz would not rest or stop until he resolved the problem of who would redeem Ruth. He would talk with the closer relative and then know whether that relative or Boaz would redeem Ruth. Naomi knew that Boaz would do what he said that same day. Either the closer relative would redeem and marry Ruth or Boaz would. By the end of the day, Ruth would know which would happen.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>until he solves the problem, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">which he will do</span> today</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>until they decide the matter <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of your marriage</span> today</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>until he has finished doing what he should do today (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>has resolved:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>resolved</em> more literally means “finished” or “completed.” Here it refers to a legal decision about what will happen. It could be translated as “decided.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>today:</strong> Naomi was putting emphasis on this word. She believed that Boaz would conclude this important issue on that day.</p>",

He met with the other close relative in the presence of many witnesses to discuss the entire situation. The other relative did not want to buy Elimelech’s property that Naomi was selling, if the arrangement also meant that he had to marry Ruth. So Boaz said that he would act as the redeemer himself.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In section 4:13–17, Boaz and Ruth were married, and the LORD soon gave them a son. The women in Bethlehem named the son Obed and rejoiced that Naomi now had a “son” to carry on her family line and care for her in her old age. So both Naomi and Ruth were going to be cared for, and the women went from “emptiness” to “fullness.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Section 4:18–22 concludes the book with a genealogy that lists of the family line of Perez, who was a son of Judah and grandson of Jacob (who is also called Israel). The family line is listed from Perez through Obed to King David.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples of section headings for 4:1–12:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Boaz Redeems Ruth (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Boaz Settles the Matter (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Structure:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some commentaries divide this section into four scenes:<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NICOT, Sakenfield, Cornerstone, and Sakenfield.

The BSB uses <em>Meanwhile</em> to begin the sentence, since it seems quite probable that Boaz went up to the gate area of the city and sat down there to wait during the same time that Ruth was returning home to Naomi and talking with her (3:16–18).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate <em>Meanwhile</em>:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Before the close relative arrived</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to the gate:</strong> Here the phrase to the gate is probably an idiom that means “went to court.” At that time it was normal for the town meeting place to be just inside the town gate.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>UBS (pages 61–63). Block (pages 203–204) defines the city gate here as equivalent to a town court.</span></span> That is where Boaz went. He did not go to the gate itself.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this verse part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Boaz went to the meeting place at the town gate (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Boaz went to the place where leaders met to decide important things/cases</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If people in your culture are not familiar with towns that have walls and gates, it may be necessary to explain in a footnote that towns had walls and gates in OT times.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and sat down there:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>sat down</em> is the same verb translated as “wait” in 3:18a. Boaz may have expected that he would have to wait for a while. Apparently, the relative he wanted to see was not there when he arrived. So he sat down to wait for him.</p><h4>4:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Soon the kinsman-redeemer of whom he had spoken came along,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>right then <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Elimelech’s</span> closest relative came by.

Use whatever special words, word order, or other method your language uses to focus attention on someone or some event.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Soon the kinsman-redeemer of whom he had spoken came along:</strong> This refers to the man whom Boaz had mentioned to Ruth. This man had the right and duty to redeem Naomi’s land and to marry Ruth.

But the author of the book of Ruth did not know the name or did not wish to provide it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are two ways to translate what Boaz said:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a direct quotation, but leave the form of address general.

The Hebrew uses a direct quotation. In some languages, it may be more natural to use a direct quotation.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in the presence of these men sitting here and in the presence of the leaders of our people (GW) <em>(BSB, CEV, ESV, KJV, NABRE, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, NJB, NJPS, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>They refer to the same group of people that Boaz selected in 4:2a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in the presence of these men sitting here (GNT) <em>(GNT, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with most versions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The BSB and the Hebrew mention the elders last. In many languages, it will better to mention the more important group, the elders, before mentioning the other people seated there. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>These ten men and the others standing here can be witnesses. (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:4d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:4d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>If you want to redeem it, do so.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>If you want to do your duty as the nearest relative, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">please</span> do it.</p></li><li><p>If you are willing to buy it back, you to have the first chance.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>If you want to redeem it, do so:</strong> In 4:4b Boaz used the general verb “buy.” But here he uses the term <em>redeem</em> that refers to the action of a kinsman-redeemer.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In this context, the verb includes the idea that a man buys back property to help a poor relative. So if possible you should keep the distinction here by using a different verb or verb phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>If you wish to <u>buy back</u> the property, you can buy back the property. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>If you are going to <u>do your duty as next-of-kin</u>, then do so (REB)</p></blockquote><h4>4:4e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:4e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But if you will not redeem it, tell me so I may know,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But if you do not want <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to do that</span>, tell me, so that I will know <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what you intend to do</span>.</p></li><li><p>But if you are not willing <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to buy it back</span>, please tell me what you decide.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But if you will not redeem it, tell me so I may know:</strong> Boaz told the man to redeem the land if he wished to do so, but asked the man to inform him if he did not want to do it. When Boaz heard the man’s answer, he would know what he himself could do.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>tell me:</strong> These two wealthy men were having a formal, legal discussion. In many languages, a direct command would be inappropriate in such a situation. Translate this direct command in a way that shows that Boaz was speaking politely to the other relative.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this verse part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But if you don’t want it, let me know right away (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But if you decide not to buy it back, please tell me so that I will know what to do</p></blockquote><h4>4:4f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:4f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because there is no one but you to redeem it, and I am next after you.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For you are the first one with the right to buy it back, but I am the next person after you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with this right</span>.”</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I say this,</span> because it is you who has the responsibility to do it. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">If you do not do it,</span> I will need to take that responsibility instead of you.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because there is no one but you to redeem it:</strong> The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>because</em> introduces the reason that Boaz wanted to know the man’s decision. Boaz wanted to buy back the property himself, but this man had the right to choose first.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and I am next after you:</strong> The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as <em>I am next after you</em> is literally “I am after you.” Boaz was the <em>next</em> relative to have the right to buy back the property.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this verse part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for I am the only person to redeem it besides yourself, and I myself come after you (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because the right to buy it belongs first to you and then to me (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>4:4g</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:4g\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“I will redeem it,” he replied.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other</span> man said, “I am willing to take this responsibility.”</p></li><li><p>The closest relative replied, “I will buy it back.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>“I will redeem it,” he replied:</strong> The nearer relative made his decision and gave a positive response. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He replied, “I will redeem it.” (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The close relative answered, “I will buy back the land.” (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that the BSB placed <em>he replied</em> after the quote. In some languages, it is more natural to put the quote after the introductory words, as in the examples above.</p>",

So Boaz said that he would act as the redeemer himself.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In section 4:13–17, Boaz and Ruth were married, and the LORD soon gave them a son. The women in Bethlehem named the son Obed and rejoiced that Naomi now had a “son” to carry on her family line and care for her in her old age. So both Naomi and Ruth were going to be cared for, and the women went from “emptiness” to “fullness.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Section 4:18–22 concludes the book with a genealogy that lists of the family line of Perez, who was a son of Judah and grandson of Jacob (who is also called Israel).

It can also mean “have gotten” or “have obtained.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Boaz was taking Ruth, Mahlon’s widow, as his wife. This was an important part of the responsibility of the “redeemer.” This is <u>not</u> the same as giving a payment to the parents of the bride, called a “bride-price,” which is practiced in many cultures. See how you translated “acquire” in 4:5b.</p><h4>4:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to raise up the name of the deceased through his inheritance,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I will marry her</span> so that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Mahlon’s</span> name will be remembered with this property.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I will marry her</span> to keep the property in the family of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Mahlon</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In 4:10b and 4:10c, Boaz stated his reasons for marrying Ruth. Here he gave a positive reason. He said that if a son would be born to him and Ruth, that son would be the heir to the property of Mahlon and would carry on Mahlon’s family name.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to raise up:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>to raise up</em> here means “establish” or “cause to continue.” If an heir would be born, the property would continue to be known as the property of the family line of Elimelech and Mahlon.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Chisholm (page 677).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the name of the deceased:</strong> This probably refers primarily to Mahlon. But Boaz was also talking about Elimelech who originally owned the property (see the GNT and NCV quoted in 4:9b). He did not distinguish between the <em>name</em> and property of the <u>father</u> Elimelek and the <u>son</u> Mahlon. But if you must be specific, it is recommended that you refer to Mahlon, as in 4:5c.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Schipper (page 170), EBC (page 1342).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>through his inheritance:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>inheritance</em> refers to the plot of land that Elimelech owned and that his sons would have inherited after he died.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this verse part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This way she can have a son to carry on the family name of her dead husband and to inherit the family property here in his hometown. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I am doing this so her dead husband’s property will stay in his name and his name will not be separated from his family and his hometown.

He said that if a son would be born to him and Ruth, people would not forget that Elimelech’s and Mahlon’s family/lineage continued to exist.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that his name will not disappear:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>disappear</em> is literally “be cut off.” If there was no heir and a different family bought Elimelech’s family land, then the name of Mahlon, and that of Elimelech and Chilion as well, would no longer be associated with this land. Their names would eventually be forgotten.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>from among his brothers or from the gate of his home:</strong> Their names would be forgotten <em>among his brothers</em> <u>in the family line</u> and <em>from the gate of his home</em> <u>in the town history</u>. First, if there was no heir, there would be no descendants or relatives to talk about them. Secondly, if the property was not bought back and was used by some other family and their descendants, the names of Mahlon and Elimelech eventually would not be mentioned in relation to the property, even <em>from the gate of his home</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>his brothers:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>his brothers</em> means Mahlon’s relatives and descendants.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>or from the gate of his home:</strong> This phrase is an idiom that refers to a family’s history in relation to their property, which is equivalent to town records. Here is another possible translation:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>or from the town records</p></blockquote><h4>4:10d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:10d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>You are witnesses today.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Today, you are witnesses.”</p></li><li><p>Today you have seen this <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and will be able to testify about it</span>.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You are witnesses today:</strong> This phrase was used to complete legal or commercial business. See the notes on 4:9b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>witnesses:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>witnesses</em> is emphasized by being placed first in the phrase in the Hebrew text.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:10a–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Since 4:10 is very long, it may be better to break it into several shorter sentences.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>May you become rich… (GNT) <em>(BSB, CEV, GNT, NABRE, NASB, NET, NJPS, NLT, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to an increase in reputation and status. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>May you become powerful… (NCV) <em>(NCV, NIV, NJB, NLT96)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to good character. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So show your strength of character… (GW) <em>(ESV, GW, KJV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It refers to an increase in children.

The people prayed that as a result of his marriage, Boaz would prosper and grow rich. However, interpretation (2) is supported by the parallelism.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>UBS (pages 71–73), KD (page 359).

He met with the other close relative in the presence of many witnesses to discuss the entire situation. The other relative did not want to buy Elimelech’s property that Naomi was selling, if the arrangement also meant that he had to marry Ruth. So Boaz said that he would act as the redeemer himself.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In section 4:13–17, Boaz and Ruth were married, and the LORD soon gave them a son. The women in Bethlehem named the son Obed and rejoiced that Naomi now had a “son” to carry on her family line and care for her in her old age. So both Naomi and Ruth were going to be cared for, and the women went from “emptiness” to “fullness.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Section 4:18–22 concludes the book with a genealogy that lists of the family line of Perez, who was a son of Judah and grandson of Jacob (who is also called Israel). The family line is listed from Perez through Obed to King David.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples of section headings for 4:1–12:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Boaz Redeems Ruth (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Boaz Settles the Matter (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Structure:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some commentaries divide this section into four scenes:<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NICOT, Sakenfield, Cornerstone, and Sakenfield.

Here they were saying the same thing about Boaz.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And may your house become like the house of Perez:</strong> <em>Perez</em> was one of Judah’s sons, a grandson of Jacob and one of the ancestors of Boaz (4:18–21). Although he was not the first-born, his family became more numerous and more important than those of his brothers.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In the family record in Genesis 46:12, Perez is the only son of Judah whose sons are recorded by name.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>house:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>house</em> refers here to all the descendants of Boaz, not just those who live in his <em>house</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>whom Tamar bore to Judah:</strong> Tamar was a foreigner who became an important person in Israelite history because she had a baby with Judah, one of the sons of Jacob. Because Ruth was also a foreigner, this may have been the reason that the people compared Ruth with Tamar.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Genesis chapter 38 for the story of Tamar.

Ruth had not yet had a child, even though she had been married to Mahlon. So the people prayed that the LORD would give Ruth children for Boaz.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by this young woman:</strong> Ruth may have married Mahlon at quite a young age, so she still could have been considered <em>young</em>. This may have been true especially when compared with Boaz, who was probably somewhat older than she was.

It also indicates the result of the decision that the elders and witnesses had made at the town gate.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife:</strong> The Hebrew clauses that the BSB translates as <em>Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife</em> mean that Boaz married Ruth. The BSB, following the Hebrew, uses two phrases to say this. In some languages, it may be better to combine these ideas into one clause and say that he married her.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this sentence:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Boaz and Ruth married one another</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Boaz married Ruth (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Then Boaz took Ruth home, and she became his wife. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>took:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>took</em> means that Boaz took Ruth to his house. This was the custom of the Israelite people. In cultures where such a custom is unknown, the phrase may sound as if Boaz <em>took</em> Ruth without her consent. Because of this, it may be best to use a general word for “married.” See the other ways of translating this word listed above.</p><h4>4:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And when he had relations with her, the LORD enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>When he had sexual relations with her, Yahweh made it possible for her to become pregnant, and she bore a son.</p></li><li><p>Then he slept with her, and Yahweh helped her and she became pregnant.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And when he had relations with her:</strong> The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as <em>when he had relations with her</em> means that Boaz and Ruth had sexual relations. The Hebrew is more literally “And he went in to her.” The BSB translation is a euphemism. It is a way of politely saying that Boaz and Ruth had sexual relations. In some cultures, it may be acceptable to translate this without a euphemism. The phrase you choose should be one that it is acceptable to read or say in a church meeting or at any other public occasion.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when he slept with her (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>then they lay down together</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and had sexual relations with her (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions (CEV, GNT) leave this clause implied, because the meaning is clear from the following context. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and the Lord blessed her with a son (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the LORD enabled her to conceive:</strong> The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as <em>the LORD enabled her to conceive</em> means that the LORD made it possible for Ruth to become pregnant. You need to be careful how you translate this. If you say, “The LORD caused her to become pregnant,” it could give a wrong meaning. The author meant that the LORD worked to allow Ruth to conceive.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this sentence:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The LORD blessed her and she became pregnant</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Lord let her become pregnant (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The LORD helped her and she became pregnant</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and she gave birth to a son:</strong> The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as <em>she gave birth to a son</em> means that Ruth gave birth to a male child.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and she gave birth to a male child</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and she bore a son (NRSV)</p></blockquote>",

Five names represent all the generations from Perez, the son of Judah, to Nahshon, who lived at the time of Moses, about four hundred years after Perez. The names of the next five generations represent all the generations from Nahshon to David, who lived about 450 years later. Clearly, many names have been left out of the list.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The ancestors of David</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Obed in the Genealogy of David (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The list of</span> the ancestors of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">King</span> David</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The names in this listing agree with the lists in 1 Chronicles chapter 2, Matthew chapter 1, and Luke chapter 3. If you have already translated any of these books, refer to the way you transliterated the names there.</p></div><h4>4:22a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:22a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Obed was the father of Jesse,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Obed was the father of Jesse,</p></li><li><p>Obed fathered Jesse, (ESV)</p></li><li><p>Jesse was the son of Obed,</p></li></ul></div><h4>4:22b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:22b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and Jesse was the father of David.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and Jesse was the father of David.</p></li><li><p>and Jesse fathered David.

He was Israel’s most famous king and an ancestor of the Lord Jesus Christ. If your readers do not know that <em>David</em> was a king of Israel, it may be helpful to supply that information, either in the text or a footnote. Then your readers will understand why this genealogy is important and how Ruth was part of it.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jesse’s son was the father of King David.
