Then they would state the name of the person to whom they were writing. Today people do not usually start letters in this way, so you may need to use a greeting that is more natural in your language. For example, you could use a phrase in which Paul refers to himself in the first person. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I,</span> Paul, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">write this letter.</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This letter is from me,</span> Paul,</p></blockquote><h4>1:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">himself</span> chose me to represent Christ Jesus.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am</span> an apostle of Christ Jesus because God chose me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be an apostle</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>apostle:</strong> An <em>apostle</em> was a person whom Jesus had appointed or commissioned to represent him and to teach his message with authority. See the term “apostle” in the glossary and in KBT. If the term you choose for <em>apostle</em> means simply “messenger,” make sure that it does not refer to a person who only delivers a message and then has no further responsibility for the message. An apostle not only taught the message about Christ, but he also had the authority to act on behalf of Christ. He was an ambassador for Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Christ Jesus:</strong> In this letter Paul usually referred to Jesus by the name <em>Christ Jesus</em> or “Christ.” He used “Jesus Christ” only once (1:3). The Greek word <em>christos</em>, which is written “Christ” in English, means “Messiah.” However, by the time Paul wrote this letter, people were already using the word “Christ” as another name for Jesus, rather than a title. Most scholars, therefore, believe that there is no difference in meaning between the terms “Christ Jesus” and “Jesus Christ.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions (as well as other national language translations) translate “Jesus Christ” and “Christ Jesus” using the same order as the Greek text in each instance. Throughout the Display, the names “Christ Jesus” and “Jesus Christ” follow the word order of the Greek text.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">But if the people who read your translation would be confused by the different order of the names, you may decide to use the more familiar order “Jesus Christ” here and in the other places where the Greek text has “Christ Jesus.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by the will of God:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates <em>the will of God</em> means what God wants and desires. Paul wanted to clarify that when he called himself an apostle, it was not because he had decided that for himself. It was God who had chosen him to be an apostle of Christ Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul was emphasizing his authority by using the phrases “apostle of Christ Jesus” and <em>by the will of God</em> together. You should connect these two phrases in a way that shows this emphasis. The SSA has expressed the relationship between the two phrases as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>an apostle who represents/was-appointed-by Christ Jesus, because God chose <span data-bnType=\"implied\">me in order that I should be an apostle</span></p></blockquote><h4>1:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and Timothy our brother,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I, together</span> with Timothy <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who is</span> our<sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christian</span> brother, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">greet you</span>.</p></li><li><p>I <span data-bnType=\"implied\">am here</span> with our<sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christian</span> brother, Timothy.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Timothy:</strong> Timothy was with Paul when he was writing this letter. One possible reason his name was mentioned here may be that Paul dictated the letter to Timothy and Timothy wrote down what he said, but we do not know that for certain. Biblical scholars generally agree that Paul alone was the author of the letter and that Timothy did not contribute to the content.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">One way you could translate this part of the verse to avoid implying that Timothy was a co-author would be to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I, Paul, together with our<sup>(incl)</sup> brother Timothy, am sending this letter to you…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>brother:</strong> Since God is the Father of all Christians, all Christians are like brothers and sisters. Therefore, people in the NT frequently use the word <em>brother</em> when referring to a fellow Christian. You should translate this term literally in your translation if possible. However, in some languages the word <em>brother</em> can only refer to a blood relative. If this is a problem in your language, you could use a term meaning “fellow Christian.”</p>",

You have dedicated yourselves to God and you are faithful to Christ.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>saints and faithful brothers in Christ:</strong> The phrase <em>saints and faithful brothers</em> does not refer to two different groups of people. It refers to a single group: people who have dedicated themselves to God <u>and</u> who are faithful to Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>saints:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>saints</em> refers to all God’s people, that is, all true believers. It does not just refer to Christians who have done something special or whom the church today calls saints. Possible ways to translate <em>saints</em> in this verse are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>you<sup>(plur)</sup> who are devoted to God</p></li><li><p>you<sup>(plur)</sup> who are set apart for God</p></li><li><p>you<sup>(plur)</sup> who belong to God</p></li><li><p>God’s people.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">See “holy,” sense A3a in KBT and meaning 1 in the glossary for more information.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>faithful brothers:</strong> This referred to all the Christians in Colossae, both male and female. If the word you use in your language for <em>brothers</em> refers only to men, you should consider saying “brothers and sisters,” or using a neutral term like “relatives.” See also the note in 1:1c.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>faithful:</strong> This does not mean that these people were <em>faithful</em> to Paul. It means that they were faithful and loyal to Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in Christ:</strong> This is a phrase that Paul used in all his letters. It means “united to Christ” or “trusting completely in Christ.” It refers to the close relationship which Christians have with Christ and therefore with one another. It is often a difficult phrase to translate. Here “brothers in Christ” means “Christian brothers,” or “fellow believers in Christ.”</p><h4>1:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Grace and peace to you from God our Father.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I pray that God our<sup>(incl)</sup> Father will continually help you and will cause you to have peace.</p></li><li><p>May God who is our<sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">heavenly</span> Father always bless you and cause you to have inner peace.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Grace and peace to you from God our Father:</strong> In this greeting, Paul was expressing a strong desire or a prayer. In Greek, this part of the verse has no verb, but in your language you may need to supply a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I/We<sup>(excl)</sup> pray/hope that you will receive…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>May God our Father give you…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Grace:</strong> In many passages in the NT the Greek word usually translated <em>Grace</em> describes something that God does for sinful people. It means: “God helps people because he has compassion on them even though they do not deserve his help.” However in this verse it is part of a common Greek greeting and has a more general meaning. Therefore, you do not need to try and express the specific meaning of <em>Grace</em> that is described above. See “grace,” sense A1 in KBT and meaning 1 in the glossary for more information.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways you could express this using a verb are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May God our<sup>(incl)</sup> Father treat you kindly</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We<sup>(excl)</sup> pray that God our<sup>(incl)</sup> Father will help you in every way</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We<sup>(excl)</sup> ask God our<sup>(incl)</sup> Father to bless you because of his kindness</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>peace:</strong> God causes his people to be at peace with him and with one another. The meaning of the Greek word includes not only inward peace of mind, but also good health and prosperity.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you:</strong> Throughout the letter the word <em>you</em> is always plural and refers to the Colossian believers. The only exception is in 4:17, where Paul was sending a personal message to Archippus.</p>",

The use of the word <em>Father</em> is figurative and is used to express the unique and close relationship between God and Jesus. Calling God <em>Father</em> and Jesus “God’s Son” are important figures of speech throughout the NT, and you should keep these figures in your translation. If it is really impossible for you to use these figures of speech in your language, you must discuss other possibilities with your Translation Consultant to be sure you have chosen the best alternative.</p>",

He had probably heard about the church in Colossae from other people also. In some languages it is necessary to say who had told Paul about the Colossians. If this is necessary in your language, you could say “Epaphras has told us…” based on 1:8.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>faith in Christ Jesus:</strong> In many languages it is necessary to translate <em>faith</em> as a verb. One way to do this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you trust/believe in Christ Jesus</p></blockquote><h4>1:4b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:4b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and your love for all the saints—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and that you love all God’s people.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>your love for all the saints:</strong> There are several Greek words that can be translated “love” in English. The one in this verse is <em>agapē</em>. It was a word that the Greeks who lived when the New Testament was written did not often use. However, the early Christians began to use it to mean the sort of love about which Jesus taught. <em>Agapē</em> is more than a purely emotional feeling or attraction (which is often what people who speak English mean when they talk about “love” in a non-biblical context). It means loving people the way God does: caring for them, helping them, and encouraging them, without expecting them to respond in the same way or repay the kindness.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In many languages it is necessary to translate the noun <em>love</em> as a verb. One way to do this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that you love all the saints.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>saints:</strong> This is the same word as in 1:2a. See the note there.

The BSB has repeated the words <em>faith and love</em> from 1:4 to clarify the connection between 1:4 and 1:5. Paul was saying that the Colossian believers trusted in Christ Jesus and loved other Christians <u>because of the hope</u> they had.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>hope:</strong> In English the word <em>hope</em> is more like a “wish.” When someone says, “I hope it doesn’t rain,” he means that he is uncertain: he doesn’t want it to rain, but he doesn’t know if it will or not. But this is not the biblical meaning of <em>hope</em>. The Greek word <em>elpis</em>, that the BSB translates <em>hope</em>, means “to confidently expect something to happen.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Full Christian hope is this:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Christ will descend from heaven.</p></li><li><p>He will raise to life the Christians who have died, and he will gather them along with those who are still alive in order to bring them all together to meet him.</p></li><li><p>All these believers will receive new bodies.</p></li><li><p>God will accept them all as his perfect people.</p></li><li><p>They all will live forever with God and Christ in heaven.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">When Paul spoke about “the hope stored up for you in heaven,” he was referring to all these wonderful things that Christians are waiting for, the things that God has prepared for his people in heaven.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>stored up:</strong> The Greek word <em>apokeimai</em> that the BSB translates <em>stored up</em> means, “to put away, store up,” like a farmer who stores grain in a barn so he can use it in the future. Paul was not saying that God had <em>stored up</em> literal “things” like money or food, but he was referring to the reward which God has for his people and which he is “keeping safe” for them. The UBS Handbook (page 11) suggests one way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God is keeping safe for you in heaven the reward that you are confident that he will give you.</p></blockquote><h4>1:5c–6a</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the word of truth, the gospel:</strong> Paul was not writing about two different things. The <em>word of truth</em> and <em>the gospel</em> refer to the same thing. Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the true message, which is the good news (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the word of truth:</strong> This means the true message about Christ. In these verses, Paul began to emphasize that the message about Christ that the Colossians had originally been taught was the only true message about Christ. He emphasized this because some people in Colossae had begun to teach false things about Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>gospel:</strong> The Greek word <em>euaggelion</em> that the BSB translates <em>gospel</em> means “good news.” After Jesus’ death and resurrection, the first Christians soon began to use <em>euaggelion</em> to mean specifically “God’s message about Christ.” If you translate it using a general phrase like “good news,” check that the people who use your translation will understand that the term refers specifically to the message about Christ. See “gospel” in KBT and in the glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that has come to you:</strong> Although this expression is actually part of 1:6, it is joined grammatically to 1:5.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is not possible to talk about news “coming” to a place or to people. If this is the case in your language, you can say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the message that was first told to you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the message that was first brought to you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In this verse, Paul did not say who brought the gospel. In 1:7, Paul said that Epaphras taught them the gospel. However, Epaphras may not have been the only teacher who brought the gospel to Colossae. So if you need to say who brought the message in your translation, it is better to say something general like. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people came and told you…</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment about 1:5a–6a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">It may be helpful in your translation to change the order of the parts of 1:5a–6a. The GNT has done that in this way:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When the true message, the good news, first came to you, you heard about the hope it offers. So your faith and love are based on what you hope for, which is kept safe for you in heaven.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way might be to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When people first came to you and told you the true message, the good news <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about Christ, you heard it and believed it</span>. Now you are expectantly waiting for the blessings that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has planned to give you in heaven. Because of this, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you are trusting in Christ Jesus and love all God’s people</span>.</p></blockquote></div>",

Rather, he was telling the Colossians what he usually prayed for them. In Greek these four verses are one long sentence. You will probably need to divide this sentence into several sentences in your translation, as most English versions do. The main part of the long sentence is “we have not stopped praying for you and asking God…” (1:9a–b). The rest of these verses contain a list of what Paul was praying for the Colossians.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Study the different ways the English versions have broken 1:9–12 into different sentences. Consider how you can arrange the sentences and connect them together to make Paul’s prayer sound natural in your language. One way to do this would be to repeat, “We pray that…” at the beginning of each subject Paul prayed for the Colossians.</p></div><h4>1:9a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we<sup>(excl)</sup> have heard</span> this good report about you, we<sup>(excl)</sup> have been praying continually for you since the day we<sup>(excl)</sup> first heard it.</p></li><li><p>¶ Since the time <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Epaphras/people</span> told us<sup>(excl)</sup> this news about you, we<sup>(excl)</sup> have been constantly asking God to help you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For this reason:</strong> These words connect 1:9–12 with what Paul said in 1:3–8. Because of the news Paul had heard about the Colossians, he prayed for them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we have not stopped praying for you:</strong> This is another hyperbole (see 1:6b). It does not mean that Paul prayed for the Colossian believers all day and all night and never stopped. It means that he prayed for them often and regularly. If it is more natural in your language, you could translate <em>not stopped praying</em> in a positive way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we have always prayed for you (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also NCV, NLT.</p><h4>1:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of His will</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>We<sup>(excl)</sup> have been asking God to help you to know fully what he wants <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you to do</span>.</p></li><li><p>We<sup>(excl)</sup> have been requesting that God would help you to understand <span data-bnType=\"implied\">everything</span> that he wants <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you to do</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to fill you with the knowledge of:</strong> This is a figure of speech. To be “filled with knowledge of something” means “to know something fully, to understand it completely.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>His will:</strong> God’s <em>will</em> is what God wants and desires. So Paul was praying that God would cause the Colossians to know fully what he wanted for them. He was praying that they would understand all that God wanted them to do.</p><h4>1:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We<sup>(excl)</sup> have been asking God to do this</span> by making you very wise about spiritual matters and enabling you to understand them well.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in all spiritual wisdom and understanding:</strong> The Greek preposition <em>en</em> that the BSB translates <em>in</em> has many possible meanings depending on the context. Because of this, commentators have three opinions of how to connect 1:9b and 1:9c:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>1:9c is the <u>means</u> by which a person is filled with the knowledge of God’s will (1:9b). So 1:9b–c means: “[We ask God] to cause you to know fully all that he wants you to do <u>by means of</u> him making you very wise and enabling you to understand spiritual things.” <em>(NIV, GW, NJB)</em></p></li><li><p>1:9c is a <u>restatement</u> of 1:9b. So 1:9b–c means: “[We ask God] to cause you to know fully all that he wants you to do; <u>that is</u>, we ask him to make you very wise and to enable you to understand spiritual things.” No English version follows this, but several commentaries support it.</p></li><li><p>1:9c is something that <u>accompanies</u> 1:9b. So Paul not only prayed that God would fill the Colossians with the knowledge of God’s will, <u>but also</u> with all spiritual wisdom and understanding. <em>(GNT, CEV, NCV, NLT)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">All these options are possible. The Display follows the first interpretation (1) because it has strong support from both English versions and commentaries.

There are two main possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The adjectives <em>all</em> and <em>spiritual</em> modify both nouns, so it is translated <em>all spiritual wisdom and understanding</em>. <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, RSV, CEV, GW, NET, NLT)</em></p></li><li><p>The adjective <em>all</em> only modifies the noun <em>wisdom</em> and the adjective <em>spiritual</em> only modifies the noun <em>understanding</em>.

This means that Paul was not simply praying that the Colossians would be wise, but that they would be wise “spiritually.”</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>spiritual:</strong> There are two ways to understand <em>spiritual</em> in this context:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means being wise about and understanding spiritual matters, that is, about God and his ways. <em>(NCV)</em></p></li><li><p>It means that the wisdom and understanding come from the Holy Spirit. <em>(GNT, CEV)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Either of these interpretations is acceptable.

Here, however, the meaning is clear because Paul specified the way the Colossians would “bear fruit,” that is, <em>in every good work</em>. The term <em>good work</em> is the <em>fruit</em> (result) of “living a life worthy of the Lord” (1:10a).

Many English versions begin a new sentence here (RSV, GNT, CEV, GW, NCV, NLT, REB). One way to do this is to use a phrase like “We ask God…” to show that this verse is still part of Paul’s prayer.</p><h4>1:11a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:11a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>being strengthened with all power according to His glorious might</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We<sup>(excl)</sup> also pray that God</span> will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">continually</span> make you strong using his great power which has no limits</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">And we<sup>(excl)</sup> pray that</span> God will strengthen you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in your spirits</span> by empowering you to the full extent of his great power,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>being strengthened with all power:</strong> Paul was praying that <u>God</u> would strengthen the Colossian Christians. The words <em>being strengthened</em> are in the present tense in Greek, so you could translate them:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We pray that God</span> will always/continually strengthen you…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>according to His glorious might:</strong> The phrase <em>according to</em> implies <u>how much</u> God is able to strengthen people. Paul was saying: “Since God’s power is limitless, there is no limit to how much he can strengthen you.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His glorious might:</strong> The Greek text literally says “the might of his glory.” The word <em>glorious</em> clearly shows that the power comes from the all-powerful/almighty God. One way to translate <em>His glorious might</em> is “his power which is so wonderful” (see 1:11–12 in the UBS Handbook).</p><h4>1:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that you may have full endurance and patience, and joyfully</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that you may patiently and joyfully endure <span data-bnType=\"implied\">your sufferings</span></p></li><li><p>so that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as God strengthens you,</span> you will continue to trust firmly in Christ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the midst of trials</span>, and you will be patient and rejoice,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We<sup>(excl)</sup> pray this</span> so that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">even when you suffer,</span> God will help you to continue to trust him, to be patient <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with people who cause you trouble</span>, and to be joyful.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that you may have full endurance and patience:</strong> A literal translation of the Greek is “into all endurance and patience.” Most English versions translate this as the <u>goal</u> or <u>purpose</u> of 1:11a, that is, “We pray that God will strengthen you…, <u>so that</u> you will have great endurance and patience” (see BSB, NIV, GNT, CEV, GW, NCV, NLT, REB, SSA).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>endurance and patience:</strong> The two Greek words that the BSB translates <em>endurance</em> and <em>patience</em> are similar in meaning. They both refer to the way a Christian should behave when he faces a difficult situation, especially when he suffers because people persecute him for being a Christian.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>endurance:</strong> This means being steadfast/faithful. It means not giving up, even in times of suffering and persecution.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>patience:</strong> This means being patient with those who are persecuting you, that is, enduring their persecution patiently and not being angry at them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is possible to consider the two nouns “endurance” and <em>patience</em> together as the GNT has done:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So that you may be able to endure everything with patience. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and joyfully:</strong> A literal translation of the Greek is “with joy.” This phrase “with joy” can be connected to the words before it or the word after it:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some translations connect the words “with joy” to “endurance and patience” in 1:11b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to patiently endure everything with joy (GW) <em>(GW, RSV, CEV, KJV, SSA)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Other versions connect the words “with joy” to “giving thanks” in 1:12a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and joyfully giving thanks to the Father (BSB) <em>(BSB, GNT, NIV, NCV, NET, NLT, NRSV, REB).</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">There are several other places in the NT where the NT authors connect the idea of “joy” with trials or suffering. For example, see 2 Corinthians 8:1, 1 Thessalonians 1:6, Matthew 5:11–12. But in the NT the word “joy” is not usually connected to thanksgiving. Therefore it is recommended that you follow the first option (1) above.</p>",

Also, the majority of English versions follow this option.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to share in the inheritance:</strong> The Greek word <em>klēros</em> that the BSB has translated as <em>inheritance</em> means “portion, what has been allotted/promised to someone.” Here it is a figure of speech to refer to what God has promised to give Christians in heaven.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>saints:</strong> See the note on 1:4b.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the light:</strong> The BSB translates the Greek text literally as <em>in the light</em>. Some other English versions translate this phrase as “kingdom of light” (NIV, GNT, CEV, NCV, REB) to contrast this verse with 1:13a which talks about “the dominion/power of darkness.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are two ways to interpret the phrase “in the light”:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is a figure of speech and means “heaven” (SSA). God has promised that all Christians will be with him in heaven—that is the inheritance he has promised that they will all share. It is described as <em>light</em> because God is pure, that is, without sin, and, therefore, heaven is pure. It also refers to the great light surrounding God in heaven.</p></li><li><p>It refers to the morally upright way in which Christians should behave in this world (as in 1 John 1:5–7, 2:9–10). That is, <em>light</em> refers to moral purity; it refers to Christians behaving in the way that pleases God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to share the inheritance that belongs to God’s holy people, who live in the light (NLT)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Both these meanings are possible and many English versions leave it ambiguous. If you cannot leave it ambiguous in your translation, it is recommended that you follow the first option for the following two reasons:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Receiving “the lot” or “inheritance” is almost always spoken of in Scripture as something in the future. So it is more logical to see the <em>light</em> here as the light of heaven.</p></li><li><p>Paul was probably comparing the inheritance that had been promised to Christians to the inheritance that had been promised to the Israelites in the OT. Each Israelite family received their portion/share of the land when they entered the land of Canaan, just as God had promised them. In the same way, Christians will receive what God has promised them when they enter heaven.</p></li></ol>",

He has always been with God and he (with God) created the world. God has freed Christians from the power of Satan and has placed them under the rule of his Son, Christ Jesus. God has accepted those who believe in Jesus as his own people. This was possible because Jesus died on the cross instead of them.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1052001013\" data-endVerseId=\"1052001014\"><h3>Paragraph 1:13–14</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Theme: God has delivered Christians from the power of Satan and placed them under the protection of his Son.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1:13–14 are transitional verses. It is difficult to decide whether these verses should be the end of the previous section (1:9–12), or the beginning of the next section (1:15–20). In most English versions 1:13–14 are part of the same section as 1:9–12 (BSB, NIV, RSV, GNT, CEV, NCV, NJB, NLT). However, the SSA gives good reasons why a new section should begin at 1:13.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1:9–12 was Paul’s prayer for the Colossians. In 1:13–14 Paul was no longer praying, rather he was writing about how God had redeemed those who believed in Jesus. So it seems best to begin a new section at 1:13, not at 1:15. If the national language translation in your country has the section break at 1:15 and you feel you must follow that, you should at least start a new paragraph at 1:13.</p></div><h4>1:13a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He has rescued us from the dominion of darkness</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has rescued us<sup>(incl)</sup> from the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">evil</span> power of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Satan, which is like living in</span> darkness.</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">In the past Satan</span> ruled us<sup>(incl)</sup>. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">It was as though</span> we lived in darkness.

In 1:12, Paul said that God had made the Colossians worthy to share all that he had prepared for his people. In 1:13, Paul began to explain <u>how</u> God did this.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He has rescued us:</strong> A literal translation of the Greek is “who rescued us.” The “who” refers back to God the Father in 1:12.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the dominion of darkness:</strong> This contrasts with the phrase “in the light” in 1:12. Here <em>darkness</em> is a figure of speech for the evil power of Satan who rules over people who do not believe in Jesus. If <em>darkness</em> is not used as a figure of speech for evil in your language, here is another way to translate this verse part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he delivered us from the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">evil</span> power of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Satan who is the ruler of</span> evil/darkness</p></blockquote><h4>1:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and brought us into the kingdom of His beloved Son,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And he has now caused his Son, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus,</span> whom he loves, to rule us<sup>(incl)</sup>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>brought us into the kingdom of His beloved Son:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates <em>brought</em> means “change, remove, move from one place to another.” When a person becomes a Christian, God removes him from the kingdom where Satan rules, to a different kingdom, <em>the kingdom of His beloved Son</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>kingdom of His beloved Son:</strong> This means the kingdom where Jesus rules. See meaning 1 of “kingdom” in the glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>His beloved Son:</strong> The phrase <em>His beloved Son</em> refers to Jesus. It is the short form of the title, “the Son of God.” This title was often used to refer to a savior who would be a descendant of King David. God would send this savior to rescue his people. This person was often referred to as the “Messiah” or “Christ.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The title “the Son of God” also indicates that Jesus has the same nature and character as God. The relationship between God the Father and Jesus, his Son, is similar in some way to the relationship between human fathers and sons. God the Father does not have a physical body. He did not have a sexual relationship with Mary that resulted in her becoming pregnant and giving birth to Jesus. The Son of God existed eternally as the Son with his Father.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In areas where people do not understand the title “the Son of God” in this way, you may want to include a footnote that explains the correct meaning. Here is a suggested footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The title “the Son” or “the Son of God” refers to Jesus. It indicates that Jesus has the same nature and character as God. It does not mean that God the Father had a sexual relationship with Mary that resulted in her becoming pregnant and giving birth to Jesus. Mary became pregnant with Jesus in a miraculous way by the Holy Spirit of God.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is natural to speak of a son as a “child,” without specifying male or female. If that is true in your language, you may use a more general term, such as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Child<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A translation of the title “the Son of God” must include a familial term such as “son” or “child.” Translations such as “the man who is God,” “the divine man,” or “the God man” are not acceptable, since they do not retain familial language. Examples of acceptable translation options include “the Son who comes from God,” and “the divine/unique/eternal Son of God.”</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Child of God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Other verses will usually make clear that Jesus was a male child. If you use a phrase such as “the male child,” be sure that it does not imply that God had another child who was female.</p>",

It is difficult to decide whether these verses should be the end of the previous section (1:9–12), or the beginning of the next section (1:15–20). In most English versions 1:13–14 are part of the same section as 1:9–12 (BSB, NIV, RSV, GNT, CEV, NCV, NJB, NLT). However, the SSA gives good reasons why a new section should begin at 1:13.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1:9–12 was Paul’s prayer for the Colossians. In 1:13–14 Paul was no longer praying, rather he was writing about how God had redeemed those who believed in Jesus. So it seems best to begin a new section at 1:13, not at 1:15. If the national language translation in your country has the section break at 1:15 and you feel you must follow that, you should at least start a new paragraph at 1:13.</p></div><h4>1:14a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:14a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in whom we have redemption,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It is by means of his Son <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and what he did</span> that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has freed us<sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from the power of Satan</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in whom:</strong> The words <em>in whom</em> refer to “His beloved Son” in 1:13b, that is, to Jesus. It is <u>by means of the Son</u> that God redeems people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the rest of this section, 1:14–23, Paul refers to Jesus by only a pronoun (“he,” “him,” “his”). However, in your language you may need to replace one or more of these pronouns with a name. If so, you should use “his/God’s Son,” which is the way Paul referred to Jesus in 1:13. Another way would be “Christ” or “Christ Jesus” (these are other ways Paul refers to Jesus in Colossians).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>redemption:</strong> The noun <em>redemption</em> comes from the verb “to redeem” which means “to buy back something which once belonged to you.” It also means “to free someone from slavery by paying a price.” In the NT, the blood that Jesus shed when he died on the cross was the price that was paid to “redeem” people and free them from being slaves of Satan. See “redeem” in KBT for further information.</p><h4>1:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the forgiveness of sins.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and forgiven our<sup>(incl)</sup> sins.</p></li><li><p>and forgiven us for <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all</span> the sinful things <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we<sup>(incl)</sup> have done</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the forgiveness of sins:</strong> In many languages, it is necessary to use a verb to translate <em>forgiveness</em>. God is the subject of the verb.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment about 1:14</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">English versions do not agree about how 1:14a and 1:14b should be connected, that is, they do not agree about how Paul connected “redemption” and “forgiveness” in this verse. There are two possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some translations connect the two parts of the verse using the word “and.” In this case, Paul was saying that by means of his Son, God redeemed us <u>and</u> forgave our sins. <em>(CEV, NCV, NLT, REB)</em></p></li><li><p>Other versions consider that by “forgiveness,” Paul meant almost the same thing as “redemption” in 1:14a. So he was saying by means of his Son, God redeemed us, <u>that is</u>, he forgave our sins. <em>(GNT, GW)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Both of these options are possible.

It refers back to “His beloved Son” in 1:13b. See the note in 1:14a about Paul’s use of pronouns in this section. Refer to Jesus in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the image of the invisible God:</strong> When Jesus, who is God, became a man, he retained all the characteristics of God, yet people could see him. Therefore, when people saw Jesus they saw exactly what God is like, that is, they saw the character of God. This is why Paul called Jesus the <em>image</em> of God. Be sure that your translation does not cause your readers to think that Jesus merely showed people what God looked like.</p><h4>1:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the firstborn over all creation.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Just as a firstborn son <span data-bnType=\"implied\">has the greatest authority in the family,</span> so Christ has the greatest authority over everything that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has created.</p></li><li><p>He has supreme authority over all that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has created.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the firstborn over all creation:</strong> This does not refer to when Jesus was born in Bethlehem, nor does it mean that Jesus was the first person that God created. No one created Jesus. He has always existed with God and is one with God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Scholars interpret this phrase in one of three ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some biblical scholars believe that the word <em>firstborn</em> in this verse means, “the one who has the authority that the firstborn son has.” Therefore, <em>the firstborn over all creation</em> means, “the one who has supreme authority over all creation.” The word <em>firstborn</em> is used this way in Psalm 89:27:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And I will also appoint him my firstborn, the most exalted of the kings of the earth.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Other scholars believe that <em>the firstborn over all creation</em> means, “the one who existed before anything was created.”</p></li><li><p>The other main interpretation is that it means both, that is, “the one who existed from the beginning of time and who has supreme authority over all creation.”</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Throughout this section Paul was emphasizing that Christ rules over everything, so the first interpretation is the most likely. The GNT clarifies this by saying:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He is the first-born Son, superior to all created things.

It is because he is the creator of all things.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in Him all things were created:</strong> Here Paul says that all things were created <u>in</u> him. Later in 1:16e, Paul said that all things were created <u>through</u> him. Both imply that God created all things <u>by means of</u> Christ. However, the Bible never explains exactly how this happened. The important thing is that Christ was present when God created the world and played an active role in that event. You could translate it like this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God created all things by means of Christ.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Another possible way to express this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God caused him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ</span> to create all things.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in Him:</strong> In the Greek text, Paul placed the phrase <em>in Him</em> at the beginning of the clause to emphasize it. You should emphasize this phrase in your translation, too.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>were created:</strong> This is often a difficult word to translate. It means, “to cause something to begin to exist.” It means more than “to make something from existing materials.” If the verb your language uses for “to make” can include both meanings of “to create” listed above, then you can use it here.</p><h4>1:16b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:16b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>things in heaven and on earth,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">That is, he created</span> everything <span data-bnType=\"implied\">here</span> on earth, and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">also</span> everything in heaven.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This includes</span> things <span data-bnType=\"implied\">here</span> on earth and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">also</span> things in heaven.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>things in heaven and on earth:</strong> In 1:16a Paul said that God created “all things” by means of Christ.

There are two ways to understand how this part of the verse connects to 1:16b:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>When Paul said <em>visible and invisible</em>, he again meant all things. Everything that God created belongs to the group of things we can see or to the group of things we cannot see.</p></li><li><p>When Paul said <em>visible and invisible</em>, he was restating 1:16b in the opposite order (this is called a chiastic structure).

He simply wanted to emphasize that all of them, even the most powerful and important ones, were created by means of Christ.</p><h4>1:16e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:16e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>All things were created through Him and for Him.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>By means of Christ, everything was created.

Paul was saying that Christ controls and directs his people the same way that a person’s head controls and directs his body.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In many cultures, people do not consider that a person’s head controls his body. However, since the NT often uses this figure of speech, you should try to keep it in your translation. If this is impossible, you could use one of the following ways to translate this part of the verse:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the one who controls his people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the chief over his people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the one who rules over Christians</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the body:</strong> In this verse Paul was emphasizing that Christ is the head (chief, ruler) of the church. He was not emphasizing the other part of the figure of speech, that is, that the church is like Christ’s <em>body</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the church:</strong> The Greek word <em>ekklēsia</em> is translated <em>church</em> in almost all English versions. However, the Greek word means “congregation, assembly, community.” It never means a church building. Make sure you translate this term in a way that clearly refers to a gathering of Christian <u>people</u>, not to a building. For further information see “church” in the glossary and in KBT.</p><h4>1:18b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:18b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He is the beginning</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He can do this since</span> he is the source of new life for his people,</p></li><li><p>He is the one who gives life to the body, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his people</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He is the beginning:</strong> There are several ways to understand this. The two main ways are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Paul was still writing about Christ’s relation to his body, the church. English versions show this connection in different ways. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He is its origin (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he is the source of the body’s life (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The NET Bible translates 1:18a–b as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He is the head of the body, the church, as well as the beginning. (NET) <em>(REB, GNT, NET)</em></p></blockquote><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>1:18b could even be the basis for Paul’s statement in 1:18a, that is, Christ is the head of the church <u>since</u> he is its source. See the SSA for a fuller discussion of this possibility.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Paul had begun a new idea here and was referring to the beginning or source of everything, not simply the church. <em>(NCV, NJB)</em></p></li></ol></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Many English versions leave this ambiguous, although most scholars agree that Paul was still writing about Christ’s relation to the church, so it is recommended that you follow the first option (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the beginning:</strong> The Greek word <em>archē</em> that the BSB translates as <em>beginning</em> has several meanings: “beginning, source, origin, foundation.” There are many different opinions about which meaning Paul intended here. The three main opinions are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means that Christ is the <u>source</u> of the church’s life. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he is the source of the body’s life (GNT)</p></blockquote><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>See also SSA.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>It means that Christ is the <u>founder</u>, the one who <u>began</u> the church. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he is its [the church’s] origin (REB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>The phrase is connected to 1:18c, so <em>beginning</em> refers to the same thing as “firstborn from among the dead.” Several English versions imply this by the way they use punctuation to divide the verse. <em>(CEV, GW)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Since it seems that Paul was still writing about the church here (see previous note), this third option is less likely. Either of the other two is possible. The Display follows the first one (1).</p><h4>1:18c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:18c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and firstborn from among the dead,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">because</span> it was he whom God first raised from death <span data-bnType=\"implied\">never to die again</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and firstborn from among the dead:</strong> The BSB connects 1:18c to 1:18b using the word <em>and</em>, although there is no conjunction in the Greek text. Scholars suggest two ways to connect the phrase <em>firstborn from among the dead</em> in 1:18c to 1:18b:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The phrase <em>firstborn from among the dead</em> explains the <u>reason</u> why Christ is the source (beginning) of the church’s life. No English version explicitly follows this, but some reliable commentaries support this view. The UBS Handbook suggests this, as well as the SSA.</p></li><li><p>The phrase <em>firstborn from among the dead</em> is another <u>title</u> for Christ in the same way that “the beginning” is in 1:18b, and is related in some way. Many English versions seem to understood the phrase this way and they translate it as does the BSB, using <em>and</em> or a comma to separate 1:18b and 1:18c.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Either of these two options is possible and both have strong support in the commentaries. The Display follows the first option.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>firstborn from among the dead:</strong> Christ was not the first person ever to die and be resurrected. The Bible tells us about several people in the OT and the NT who died and later were brought back to life again (see, for example, the story about Lazarus in John chapter 11). However, all these people died again. Christ was the first person who rose from death with the sort of body Christians will have in heaven—a body that will never die again.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>firstborn:</strong> This is the same word that Paul used in 1:15b. However, here the meaning is different. Here Paul was not referring to Christ’s authority, but simply to the fact that Christ was the first to rise from the dead to live forever.</p><h4>1:18d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:18d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that in all things He may have preeminence.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God planned it this way</span> in order that Christ alone should be the supreme ruler <span data-bnType=\"implied\">over all that exists</span>.</p></li><li><p>so that Christ would be the most important person/thing <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the universe</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that in all things He may have preeminence:</strong> This sentence explains the purpose for 1:18b–c. God raised Christ from death and caused him to be the source of the church’s life, <u>so that</u> Christ would be the supreme ruler over everything.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in all things:</strong> The Greek words that the BSB translates <em>in all things</em> can mean:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“<u>all things</u>.” This is how most English versions have translated it.</p></li><li><p>“<u>every way</u>.” Only the NJB has this in the text, though the SSA also supports this translation.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Both of these are acceptable. Your choice of which term to use in your language may depend on how you translate “preeminence.” The important thing is that your translation should communicate that Christ is most important.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>preeminence:</strong> This Greek word that the BSB translates <em>preeminence</em> is related to the word “first.” It means that Christ has the first place, he is first in rank, honor, and influence. Here is another way to translate this verse part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in order that he alone might have the first place in all things (GNT)</p></blockquote>",

In Greek there is no subject of the verb that the BSB translates <em>was pleased</em>. There are two main possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The subject of the verb is <em>God</em>. This is how most English versions translate the verse. <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, CEV, GW, NCV, NET, NLT).</em></p></li><li><p>The subject of the verb is <em>fullness</em>. This is how the RSV translates the verse.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most scholars agree that <em>God</em> is the subject of the verb <em>was pleased</em> and so it is recommended that you follow the first option (1). Another way to translate the words <em>God was pleased</em> is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God decided…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>all His fullness:</strong> The Greek is literally “all <u>the</u> fullness.” It is not clear from this verse alone what <em>fullness</em> Paul meant. However, this is similar to what Paul says in 2:9: “in Christ all the fullness of the Deity dwells in bodily form.” This helps us to understand that Paul was probably referring to God’s fullness in this verse. When Jesus came into the world, even though he became a man, he was still God, and he still retained all the power and characteristics of God.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>We know from what Paul says in this letter to the Colossians that there were people in Colossae teaching false doctrine. These teachings were probably similar to what was later called gnosticism. Gnosticism taught that between God and people there were many lesser gods and powerful beings, and that Christ was just one of these beings. That is why in this letter Paul told the Colossians how supreme and how important Christ is. Here in 1:19 Paul says that “<u>all</u> the fullness” of God was in Christ. Christ is not just one of many powerful beings between God and man, Christ is not just a little like God. <u>All</u> of God and God’s nature was <u>fully</u> in Christ.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in Him:</strong> This, of course, refers to Christ. In the Greek text Paul placed these words at the beginning of the clause to emphasize them. You should emphasize them in your translation in a way that is natural in your language.</p>",

In other words, God was pleased to do two things: (1) to have all his fullness dwell in Christ (1:19), and (2) <em>to reconcile to Himself all things</em> (1:20a).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>through Him:</strong> The pronoun <em>Him</em> refers to Christ here, as it does in 1:19, and Paul placed the words at the beginning of the verse to emphasize them.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In some Greek manuscripts the words “through him” occur twice. In the UBS Greek text, the second occurrence of “through him” is in brackets. This means it is doubtful that these words were in the original letter that Paul wrote. The UBS Greek text of 1:20 literally reads:and through him to reconcile all things to him, having made peace through the blood of his cross, [through him] whether things on the earth or the things in the heavens.The KJV includes this second “through him” in its translation. The important thing to remember in your translation is that “through him,” whether it occurs once or twice, is emphatic. Make sure Christ is the topic of these verses in your translation.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>reconcile:</strong> The word <em>reconcile</em> means “to change people from being enemies to being friends” or “to make peace between people who were once friends but have become enemies of one another.” When God created the world, he intended that everything and everybody should live in harmony and peace with him. But when Adam and Eve sinned, that peace and harmony was destroyed. When Christ died on the cross, he made it possible for people to have peace with God again.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>all things:</strong> The words <em>all things</em> mean “everything that has been created.” Remember that in 1:16–17 Paul used these same words, <em>all things</em>, four times to refer to everything that God created. So Paul was saying that God not only reconciled all <u>people</u> to himself, but he also reconciled everything he had created.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>We know from teachings in other parts of the Bible that not everyone will be saved. There will be people, as well as Satan and his angels, in hell. But when we read in Colossians 1:19–20 that “God was pleased…to reconcile to himself all things,” it sounds as if Paul was saying that God would make <u>all things</u> right with himself, and so <u>all people</u> would be saved. Be careful of trying to “explain” what Paul said in your translation. In 1:20 Paul made a strong universal statement. It is best if you translate his statement simply and clearly. Do not try to “make it fit” what the Bible teaches in other passages.</span></span></p><h4>1:20b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:20b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>whether things on earth or things in heaven,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This includes</span> things that are on earth and things that are in heaven.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>whether things on earth or things in heaven:</strong> This is almost the same as what Paul wrote in 1:16b and the meaning is the same in both verses—it means “everything.”</p><h4>1:20c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:20c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>by making peace through the blood of His cross.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God made a way for all things</span> to be at peace <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with himself</span> by having his Son shed his blood <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and die</span> on a cross.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He did that</span> by means of the blood that his Son shed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when he died</span> on the cross. Now everything can be at peace with God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by making peace:</strong> The phrase <em>making peace</em> means almost the same as “reconcile” in 1:20a. It means “to cause people to be in harmony.” It does not mean that God caused all things to be at peace with one another, rather it means that he made peace between them and <u>himself</u>.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>through the blood of His cross:</strong> This explains more clearly what Paul meant by “through Him” in 1:20a. The word <em>blood</em> refers to the way Christ died. God required that blood be shed in order for him to forgive sins (Hebrews 9:22). So Christ’s blood is an important symbol in the Bible, and therefore you should keep it in your translation. One way you could clarify it would be to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>by sending Christ to shed his blood and die on a cross</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment about 1:20</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is clearer to reorder the parts of 1:20 before translating the verse. Some English versions have done this. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And God was pleased for him to make peace by sacrificing his blood on the cross, so that all beings in heaven and on earth would be brought back to God. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also GNT. Another way to reorder 1:20 is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God decided to send his Son, who shed his blood and died on a cross. God did this in order to restore harmony between himself and all things. In this way, he made peace between himself and all that exists in heaven and all that exists on the earth.</p></blockquote></div>",

In English this can be expressed, “But as for <u>you</u>…,” or, “And you yourselves…” Paul used this emphasis to change the focus of the letter at this point. In 1:15–20 he had written about the greatness of Christ, here he began to write about the Colossian Christians’ relationship to God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>alienated from God:</strong> The Greek text does not contain the words <em>from God</em> (see RSV and NET). However, almost all commentators agree that the text here implies the words <em>from God</em>. Therefore the BSB and many other English versions include these words. Paul was saying that the Colossians were separated from God. Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>far away from God (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul did not mean that the Colossians were physically far away from God. He meant that they did not have a relationship with him because their sinful deeds separated them from him. Other ways to translate this might be:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you were like strangers to God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you had turned your backs on God</p></blockquote><h4>1:21b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:21b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and were hostile in your minds,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and you were hostile to God in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all</span> your thoughts,</p></li><li><p>and the way you thought was against God,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>hostile in your minds:</strong> This phrase continues to describe what the Colossians were like before they became Christians: they were <em>hostile</em> toward God.

He has always been with God and he (with God) created the world. God has freed Christians from the power of Satan and has placed them under the rule of his Son, Christ Jesus.

You will probably need to divide it into several sentences in your translation. The main verb of this sentence is “he has reconciled you” (1:22). In the previous paragraph Paul said that God’s plan was to reconcile all things to himself (1:20).

You should translate the word <em>reconciled</em> here the same way as you did in 1:20.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>He:</strong> There are a number of pronouns in the Greek text of this verse and it is not clear to whom they refer. Scholars do not agree about who is the subject of the verb “reconciled.” It could be either God or Christ. Most commentators and English versions prefer God as the subject, and this is consistent with all that the NT teaches. So it is recommended that you clarify that God is the subject in your translation.</p><h4>1:22b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:22b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>by Christ’s physical body through death</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>by having his Son become human and die <span data-bnType=\"implied\">on the cross</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The way God did this was</span> by means of Christ becoming a man and dying.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by Christ’s physical body through death:</strong> This is similar to what Paul said in 1:20c. God reconciled the Colossians to himself <u>by means of</u> <em>Christ’s…death</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ’s physical body:</strong> The Greek literally says, “the body of his flesh” (see RSV). Paul was emphasizing that Christ had a <em>physical body</em>, a human body.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Why did Paul talk about “Christ’s physical body” in Colossians 1:22, and 2:9? Some scholars believe that the false teachers in Colossae taught that people needed the help of spiritual beings, such as angels, in order to be made acceptable to God. So, in order to fight against this false teaching, Paul wrote that God had reconciled us to himself, not with the help of angels or other spiritual creatures, but by Christ and Christ alone. All of God was in Christ bodily (2:9). His physical body literally died on a cross and his blood poured out (1:20c, 1:22b).</span></span></p><h4>1:22c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:22c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to present you holy, unblemished, and blameless in His presence—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God did this</span> so that when he brings you to be where he is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the future</span>, you will be pure and without any sin or guilt.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God reconciled you by having Christ die</span> so that when you stand before God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">at the time when he judges all people</span> he will consider you to be completely pure, without sin, and no one will have any reason to accuse you of doing anything wrong.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to present you holy, unblemished, and blameless in His presence:</strong> This states the <u>purpose</u> of 1:22a. God had reconciled the Colossians to himself <u>in order to</u> present them <em>holy, unblemished, and blameless</em>. The subject of this part of the verse is the same as the subject of 1:22a, that is, God. See the note on 1:22a. So Paul was saying, “God has reconciled you…in order that he <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> can present you…”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to present you…in His presence:</strong> This means, “to cause you to be in his presence,” or “to bring you to be where he is.” Scholars do not agree about when this happens:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Many scholars say that these words refer to the <u>future</u>, that is, to the day when God will judge everyone.</p></li><li><p>Some scholars believe that Paul was writing about something that is <u>already</u> true. By means of Christ’s death, God has already brought those who believe in him into his presence and caused them to be holy and pure. <em>(CEV, NLT)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Both these interpretations are true, and are taught elsewhere in the Bible. Many English versions are ambiguous because the Greek text could mean either. The Display follows the first interpretation (1), since most commentaries prefer it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>holy, unblemished, and blameless:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In 1:22c–d Paul said that God’s purpose was to make us “to present you holy, unblemished, and blameless in His presence.” Paul was not talking about our actual behavior. No Christian behaves perfectly and never sins. But God has forgiven us for our sins and has justified us. So, now when God judges us, he considers us no longer guilty of sin. He now considers us righteous (2 Corinthians 5:21; Romans 8:1–4) and “holy…unblemished, and blameless.” And in the future, when God raises us from the dead and gives us new bodies, he will make us truly holy in our actions also.</span></span>: Paul uses three words or phrases that mean almost the same thing.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>holy:</strong> The Greek word <em>hagios</em> that the BSB translates <em>holy</em> normally means “dedicated to God.” In this context, the meaning is “pure.” (See “holy” in KBT and meaning 2 in the glossary).</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>unblemished:</strong> The Greek word <em>amōmos</em> that the BSB translates <em>unblemished</em> is a term that is used to describe an animal that has no cuts, bruises, or other physical problems—an animal that is acceptable as a sacrifice (1 Peter 1:19; Exodus 12:5). Here it means “morally pure, having no sins.”</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>blameless:</strong> The Greek word <em>anegklētos</em> which the BSB translates <em>blameless</em> means that no one can accuse believers before God and say they are guilty of sinning.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If your language does not have three different terms for these concepts, there are several ways you can combine them. The main reason Paul used three separate words with similar meanings was to strengthen his statement. The SSA suggests that the meaning is simply, “in order that you should be completely holy.” Another way to translate these three terms is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>completely pure and without blame in any way</p></blockquote>",

This verse states the condition for 1:22. 1:22 will only be true if the Colossian Christians continue in their faith.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some Christians believe in a doctrine called eternal security. This means that if a person has truly believed in Jesus, nothing they can do can cause them to lose that salvation. Other Christians do not believe this. They believe that a person can truly believe in Jesus and be saved, but later this person can lose his or her salvation, because he turns away from Christ. Colossians 1:23 is a verse that people often quote when talking about this teaching. You should translate this verse as simply as possible with no explanation. Do not try to make your translation fit what you believe about eternal security.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>continue in your faith:</strong> In Greek the words that the BSB translates <em>continue in your faith</em> are literally “continue in the faith.” It means “continue to believe” or “keep believing.” The object of their faith is probably the gospel. So if you need to supply the object of the verb “believe” in your language, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But you must continue to believe in the gospel</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>…believe in Jesus</p></blockquote><h4>1:23b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:23b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>established and firm,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">that is,</span> your faith must remain strong, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like a house that has been built on a firm foundation,</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>established and firm:</strong> This is one way the Colossians were to “continue in their faith.” These two words, <em>established</em> and <em>firm</em>, mean almost the same thing.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>established:</strong> The Greek word <em>themelioō</em> that the BSB translates <em>established</em> means “to place on a firm foundation.” This is a figure of speech here. It means that just as a solid foundation causes a house to be stable and strong, so the Colossians must have faith that is firm and strong.</p><h4>1:23c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:23c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>not moved from the hope of the gospel you heard,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and you must not let anyone stop you from hoping for what <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> promised to you in the gospel.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not moved from the hope of the gospel you heard:</strong> In Greek this verse part translated literally says: “and not moving/shifting from the hope of the gospel.” The <em>hope of the gospel</em> means “the hope God promised in the gospel.” Some of the things he promised to those who believe are:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>to raise them after they die</p></li><li><p>to make them holy and perfect</p></li><li><p>to bring them to live with him in heaven forever</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">See the note on 1:5a for the meaning of the word <em>hope</em>.

In this verse you could say, for example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you confidently wait for God to do what he promised in the gospel</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>not moved:</strong> There are two ways to understand these words:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It has a passive sense: that is, “do not let anyone/anything move you so that you stop hoping…” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and must not allow yourselves to be shaken from the hope you gained when you heard the gospel (GNT) <em>(GNT, NCV, GW, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It has an active sense:<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Greek verb can actually be understood as middle voice, rather than active.</span></span> “do not stop hoping…” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You must not give up the hope you received when you heard the good news (CEV) <em>(CEV, NLT, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow the first interpretation (1) because one reason Paul wrote this letter to the Colossian believers was to warn the Colossians not to be deceived by false teachers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>gospel:</strong> See the word gospel in the glossary.</p><h4>1:23d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:23d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>This is the message that has been announced to everyone everywhere.</p></li><li><p>This gospel has <span data-bnType=\"implied\">already</span> been proclaimed to people all over the world.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>has been proclaimed:</strong> This refers to the “gospel” (1:23c).

A <em>servant</em> is a person who serves another person or works for him. Paul meant that he was a person who worked to proclaim the gospel. In the next paragraph (1:24–29) Paul explained more about his work as a <em>servant</em> of the gospel.</p>",

Rather he was saying that he was willing to suffer for the Christians in Colossae and other places.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for you:</strong> The words <em>for you</em> mean “in order to help you,” or “to benefit you.” In this section, 1:24–2:5, Paul spoke mainly about his work to preach the gospel to the Gentiles (those who were not Jews), and so the pronoun <em>you</em> means, “you Gentile Christians.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The reason Paul had been suffering was that when he preached the gospel, especially to the Gentiles, his enemies had often persecuted him and put him in prison.</p><h4>1:24b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:24b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and I fill up in my flesh what is lacking in regard to Christ’s afflictions</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And I <span data-bnType=\"implied\">willingly</span> suffer all that Christ requires me to suffer on his behalf</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">As Christians, we must continue to endure suffering.</span> Just as Christ suffered, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so I willingly</span> suffer physically all that is necessary</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I fill up in my flesh what is lacking in regard to Christ’s afflictions:</strong> This is a difficult expression to understand and scholars disagree about what it means. It is not possible in these notes to explain all the different possibilities. Because of this, these notes present one major view among the many. For other views, you need to consult commentaries.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I fill up:</strong> The Greek verb <em>antanaplērō</em> that the BSB translates <em>I fill up</em> means, “I complete (something) by adding what is lacking.” Here it means, “I am completing what Christ has appointed for me to suffer,” or “I am completing my responsibility to suffer [on behalf of Christ].” Paul did this willingly (see the note on 1:24a).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in my flesh:</strong> This means that Paul was writing about <u>physical</u> suffering (see GNT).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>what is lacking:</strong> This clause implies what Christ taught, that is, that all Christians will suffer persecution. So here Paul meant that he was suffering what still needed to be suffered.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in regard to Christ’s afflictions:</strong> The Greek word <em>thlipsis</em> that the BSB translates <em>afflictions</em> is not used in the NT to refer to what <u>Christ</u> suffered when he died on the cross. It refers to the persecution, difficulties, and other physical and emotional hardships that <u>Christians</u> suffer. For example, it is used in Matthew 24:9, John 16:33, and Revelation 7:14.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Biblical scholars have different opinions about what the phrase <em>Christ’s afflictions</em> means in this context. The three most common opinions are as follows:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“<span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am suffering</span> on behalf of Christ.”</p></li><li><p>“<span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am suffering</span> the sufferings of Christ”—that is, “through my suffering, as a member of the body of Christ, it is as if Christ himself were suffering.”</p></li><li><p>“<span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am suffering</span> in the same way Christ suffered.”</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow the first option (1). Since Paul was writing about his own sufferings, it seems more likely that he was saying that he was suffering on behalf of Christ, that is, for the sake of Christ. (See Acts 9:16.)</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul was not saying that what Christ suffered on the cross lacked something. This would imply that Jesus’ death was not sufficient to save those who believe in him. Your translation should be worded carefully to avoid suggesting this.</p><h4>1:24c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:24c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for the sake of His body, which is the church.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>in order to help his people, who are <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> his body.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>His body, which is the church:</strong> See the notes on <em>body</em> and <em>church</em> in 1:18a.</p>",

Paul’s job was to “fully proclaim God’s message,” or “to tell people about God’s message.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the word of God:</strong> This refers to the message from God, the gospel.

Some English versions do not translate this conjunction.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>how much I am struggling:</strong> The Greek word <em>agōna</em> that the BSB translates <em>struggling</em> has the same root as the word that Paul used in 1:29b. It refers to a physical struggle, for example, an athletic contest or a battle, but also emphasizes the emotions that are involved: “I am struggling/agonizing.” In 1:28–29 Paul had said that he was <em>struggling</em> so that everyone might be perfect in Christ. Here in 2:1 he said that he was <em>struggling</em> specifically for the Christians in Colossae and for others whom he had never met and therefore had never taught.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Because Paul was in prison when he wrote this letter, he could not literally work for the Colossians by preaching or helping them in other ways, so he probably was referring to <em>struggling</em> by praying intensively and letter writing. You could translate this verse part as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I want you to know how concerned I am for you.</p></blockquote><h4>2:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and for those at Laodicea,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">also</span> the Christians in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the town of</span> Laodicea,</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am also doing all I can to help</span> the believers in Laodicea,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Laodicea:</strong> Laodicea was a town northwest of Colossae, further down the Lycos river. Paul probably mentioned Laodicea because it was close to Colossae, and because he knew that the believers in Laodicea would later read this letter (see 4:16b).</p><h4>2:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and for all who have not met me face to face,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and all <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the other Christians</span> who have not met me personally.</p></li><li><p>as well as all <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the other believers</span> whom I have not met.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and for all who have not met me face to face:</strong> Paul had never preached the gospel in either Colossae or Laodicea, but he was still concerned for believers there and in other places where he had not personally worked. In your translation, you may need to clarify that the believers in Colossae and Laodicea are included in the larger group of <em>all who have not met me face to face</em>. One way to do this is to translate 2:1c as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…and for all <u>other</u> believers who have not met me.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to do this is to reverse the order of the clauses in 2:1. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I want to tell you how hard I have worked for all the believers who have never met me personally, including you there in Colossae and also the believers in Laodicea.</p></blockquote>",

He meant that he wanted the Colossians to be encouraged personally, within themselves. Many English versions do not translate this part of the verse literally (see GNT, GW, NCV, NLT). There are several ways you could translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate literally and use your word for <em>heart</em>. You should only do this if the heart is considered the center of emotions in your culture.</p></li><li><p>Use an idiom that has the same meaning in your culture.</p></li><li><p>Translate the phrase directly, for example, “<span data-bnType=\"implied\">I want to</span> encourage you spiritually” or “<span data-bnType=\"implied\">I want to</span> strengthen you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in your faith</span>.”</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">You should use the option which is most natural in your language.</p><h4>2:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>knit together in love,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and so that your love for one another will unite you.</p></li><li><p>so you will love each other more and more, and in this way you will be one united group,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>knit together in love:</strong> Paul was concerned that the false doctrines being taught in Colossae would divide the Christians. He wanted them to be united <u>by means of</u> the love they had for one another as they believed the true teaching about Christ. You could translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I want you all to love one another and, in that way, to be united.</p></blockquote><h4>2:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and filled with the full riches of complete understanding,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I want you all</span> to have the wonderful blessings that result when you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">truly</span> understand <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s message</span> and are completely sure <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that it is true</span>.</p></li><li><p>so that you will all have the great joy and assurance that people have who understand completely <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s message</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>full riches:</strong> Paul wanted the Colossians to have “all riches” that come from understanding and being certain about God’s message. The word <em>riches</em> is used as a figure of speech here. It does not mean money or other possessions, but it means the wonderful blessings and benefits that result from understanding and being certain about God’s message. This includes benefits such as joy and peace.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>complete understanding:</strong> The Greek expression that the BSB translates <em>complete understanding</em> is literally “the full-assurance of understanding.” Scholars understand the word <em>plērophoria</em> (BSB <em>complete</em>) in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means, “full assurance.” The whole expression then means that Paul wanted the Colossians to have the “complete assurance, certainty” which would come from truly understanding the message about Christ. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the full wealth of assurance which true understanding brings (GNT) <em>(GNT, KJV, NET, NLT, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “fullness.” The whole expression then means “complete/full understanding.” This is how the BSB understands it. <em>(BSB, NIV, RSV, CEV, GW, NCV, SSA)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Both of these options are possible meanings for <em>plērophoria</em>. The Display follows the first option (1), since most commentaries support it.</p><h4>2:2d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that they may know the mystery of God, namely Christ,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I want you to have this assurance</span> so that you will know God’s plan that he had not revealed to people in the past.

Paul was saying that Christ is the center of God’s mystery. To know God’s mystery is to know <u>about Christ</u>, or to know <u>Christ himself</u>. In some languages it will be necessary to clarify this by placing the word <em>Christ</em> into a separate clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I want you all to know the mystery of God, <u>that is, I want you to know</u> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about</span> <u>Christ</u>.</p></blockquote>",

When Paul said he was <em>absent from you in body</em>, he simply meant that he was physically far away from them, in a different city, hundreds of kilometers away. When he said he was <em>present with you in spirit</em>, he meant that he constantly thought about them and was concerned for them. In some languages it may be better to translate this as a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is as if I am with you.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Display shows some non-figurative ways to translate these phrases.</p><h4>2:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and I delight to see your orderly condition</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I am happy because I know that you remain united</p></li><li><p>And I am happy to hear that you are continuing to be one united group,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and I delight to see:</strong> Paul could not literally <em>see</em> the Colossians, for he was in a different city. However, although he was far away from Colossae, he was thinking about the Colossians and it was <u>as if</u> he could <em>see</em> them. Paul knew about the Colossian believers because he had <u>heard</u> news from Epaphras and others. In your language it might be more natural to translate the verb <em>see</em> using another verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am happy to hear…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am happy to know/learn <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from what I’ve heard</span>…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>your orderly condition:</strong> Paul told the Colossian believers that he was pleased about two things. He was happy that they were <em>orderly</em> (2:5c), and that their faith was “firm” (2:5d). Both these words in Greek were used as military terms. The word translated <em>orderly</em> means “to stand together in orderly ranks,” like soldiers in a military parade. There are two ways to interpret it:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Colossian believers were united. <em>(SSA, GNT, REB)</em></p></li><li><p>The Colossian believers were behaving in an orderly manner. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am glad to know you are living as you should (CEV) <em>(CEV, NCV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow the first interpretation (1), since it fits the context better. Paul was happy to hear that the Colossian believers were united and that the false teachers had not divided them. He was happy that the Colossians had not divided into groups that believed different false teachings.</p><h4>2:5d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:5d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and firm faith in Christ.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and that you are firmly trusting in Christ.</p></li><li><p>and you are continuing to believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">only</span> in Christ.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>firm faith in Christ:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates <em>firm</em> means “to maintain a firm position, to be unmoved.” Although there was false teaching in Colossae, the majority of the Christians had continued to trust firmly in Christ.

The form of this verb once more shows that this was an action that had been completed. When the Colossians believed the gospel, they became like a plant that has its roots deep in the soil and stays firmly in place. Paul was telling them to continue to believe firmly all the main teachings about Christ, and not to begin to believe different teachings.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>built up in Him:</strong> This is the second figure of speech in this part of the verse. Paul was telling the Colossians that in the same way that a building is larger when it is built higher/taller, so their relationship with Christ should grow larger. Paul did not specify exactly what he meant by this. He may have meant that he wanted the Colossians to continue to know more about Christ, or he may have meant that they should continue to trust more in Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The form of the verb shows that this is a continuous action, that is, that Paul wanted the Colossians to continue to be <em>built up</em> in Christ more each day.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If it is not possible for you to use these figures of speech in your language, you could:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>translate the meaning with no figures of speech,</p></li><li><p>use a figure of speech from your language which has the same meaning.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">One way you could translate this with no figures of speech is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You have firmly believed and trusted in him, so continue to do this and continue to grow in your relationship with him.</p></blockquote><h4>2:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>established in the faith as you were taught,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and continue to be convinced/sure that what <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> taught you about Christ is the truth,</p></li><li><p>and you must continue to believe more and more strongly in what <span data-bnType=\"implied\">your teachers</span> taught you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about Christ</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>established in the faith as you were taught:</strong> There are two ways to understand <em>the faith</em> here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to all the true teachings about Christ. So Paul wanted the Colossians to grow stronger and more convinced about the true Christian message. SSA and many commentaries support this view.</p></li><li><p>It refers to personal faith in Christ. So Paul wanted the Colossians to grow stronger in their own faith. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>become ever stronger in your faith (GNT) <em>(CEV, GNT, NET, UBS Handbook).</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions translate this phrase ambiguously. Because the phrase <em>as you were taught</em> follows the words <em>the faith</em>, the first option (1) is probably correct in this context. Paul wanted the Colossians to become more and more convinced that the faith they had been taught was true.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>established:</strong> The Greek word <em>bebaioō</em> that the BSB translates <em>established</em> means “to make sure, to confirm.” So 2:7b means, “Continue to be convinced/sure that the things you have been taught are true.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>as you were taught:</strong> Paul mentioned in 1:7 that Epaphras was one of the people who taught the Colossians about Christ. If is it not possible in your language to use a passive (<em>you were taught</em>), you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>like <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> taught you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>like <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Epaphras and others</span> taught you</p></blockquote><h4>2:7c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:7c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and overflowing with thankfulness.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and be continually very thankful to God.</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when you talk to God</span> always thank him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for all that he has done for you</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>overflowing with thankfulness:</strong> This means being very thankful <u>to God</u>. Paul was not writing about being thankful in a general sense.</p>",

When a person is captured, he is forced to do whatever his captors want. In the same way the false teachers wanted to make the Colossian believers believe them and do whatever they commanded. So Paul means, “Be careful. Do not let anybody trick you and tell you what you must believe.” The SSA says, “Make sure that no one makes you become his disciple.”</p><h4>2:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>through philosophy and empty deception,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>their ideas about God/religion.

What they teach may sound wise/true, but it is false and worthless.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>philosophy and empty deception:</strong> Among the non-Christian Greek people, there were many philosophers. A philosopher is a person who spends most of his time thinking and teaching about the gods and supernatural spirits. The Greek people admired and respected these philosophers very much. It seems that some of the Greek Christians in Colossae were thinking up ideas about God in this way, but their ideas were wrong. Paul was afraid that other Christians in Colossae would be led astray by listening to their teaching.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>philosophy:</strong> Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>human wisdom (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>teaching/ideas about God/spirits</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>empty:</strong> Paul said that the things they taught were <em>empty</em>, that is, “worthless, having no value,” their teachings did not help anyone truly to know God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>deception:</strong> He also said that what they taught caused <em>deception</em>. This word implies that what they taught sounded true and wise, but it was wrong, and it deceived people.</p><h4>2:8c–e</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:8c–e, Paul used three phrases to describe in more detail what these people taught.</p><h4>2:8c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:8c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>which are based on human tradition</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The things they teach are <span data-bnType=\"implied\">merely</span> ideas that have been passed on from other people,</p></li><li><p>It is based only on ideas which people have invented,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>which are based on human tradition:</strong> A literal translation of the Greek is “according to the traditions of people.” Paul wanted to emphasize that these teachings were from <u>people</u>, not from <u>God</u>. These were ideas that people had invented, not truths that God revealed. Here is another way to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>only human teachings (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>tradition:</strong> Traditions are normally ideas and customs that have been passed-down/imparted from older people to younger people. The same Greek word is used in Matthew 15:2–3, 15:6; 1 Corinthians 11:2; 2 Thessalonians 2:15, 3:6. If you have an expression in your language for teachings that the elders tell to younger people, you may be able to use it here.</p><h4>2:8d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:8d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and the spiritual forces of the world</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they teach people to follow</span> rules that concern things in this world</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and:</strong> This verse part is parallel to 2:8c and begins with the same Greek word <em>kata</em> “according to.” The things the false teachers taught depended on two things: “human tradition” (2:8c) and “the basic principles of this world” (see NIV alternative source line for 2:8d). The BSB uses the word <em>and</em> here to show that the false teaching came from “the basic principles of this world” <u>in a similar way</u> to how it came from “human tradition.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the spiritual forces of the world:</strong> The NIV translates this Greek phrase: “basic principles of the world.” The reason there are two different translations is because the Greek word <em>stoicheia</em> that the BSB translates <em>spiritual forces</em> and the NIV translates “basic principles” has two meanings:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It could mean, “elementary principles and rules about behavior.” <em>(NIV, NJB, SSA)</em></p></li><li><p>It could refer to “the heavenly bodies,” that is, the sun, moon, and stars. In this context it would refer specifically to the spirits whom the Greeks believed were in control of these bodies. <em>(BSB, GNT, RSV, CEV, NCV, NET, NLT, REB)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Although most English versions prefer the second option (2), the commentaries are fairly equally divided. The first option is recommended here (1) because it makes best sense in the context. Paul was talking about false teaching. He used this same word <em>stoicheia</em> in 2:20, where he followed it immediately with a list of rules that people had made. Therefore, in this context Paul probably meant the basic religious rules which people invent.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>of the world:</strong> There are two ways to understand this:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It mean that these were rules <u>about</u> the world and the things in the world, that is, rules about external things, such as food, clothes, ceremonies, etc. See SSA.</p></li><li><p>It means that <u>people</u> invented these rules. So <em>world</em> here means “people in the world.”</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Both are possible in the context. However when Paul wrote more about this in 2:16, 20–23, he explicitly referred to laws concerning external things, so it is best to follow the same interpretation here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you wish to follow the second option, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">And they teach people</span> to obey regulations that people have invented.</p></blockquote><h4>2:8e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:8e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>rather than on Christ.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>rather than <span data-bnType=\"implied\">teaching the true message</span> about Christ.</p></li><li><p>rather than depending on <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the true teaching about</span> Christ.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>rather than on Christ:</strong> A literal English translation of the Greek is “and not according to Christ.” This is in contrast to 2:8c–d where Paul had described the two things on which the false teachers depended for their teaching. Here Paul said what they did <u>not</u> depend on.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">These words have two possible meanings:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The things the false teachers taught were not the true teachings <u>about Christ</u>. SSA expresses this: “it teaches what is contrary to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the true teachings about</span> Christ.” <em>(BSB, NIV, REB)</em></p></li><li><p>What the false teachers taught was not <u>from Christ</u>. That is, it did not agree with what Christ taught and the truth he gave to his followers. <em>(GNT, CEV, NCV, NLT)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Both interpretations are possible and their meaning is very similar. However, the first one is closer to the normal meaning of the Greek word <em>kata</em> “according to,” which Paul used to begin each phrase in 2:8c–e, so the first interpretation is recommended (1).</p>",

The Greek word <em>hoti</em> that the BSB translates <em>For</em> connects 2:9 with 2:8. Paul was saying: “<span data-bnType=\"implied\">Do not let them deceive you,</span> <em>for …”</em></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in Christ all the fullness of the Deity dwells in bodily form:</strong> This verse is similar to 1:19. In 1:19 Paul said that God decided to have “all His fullness” live in Christ. In 2:9 Paul explained more clearly what this meant. He says <em>all the fullness of the Deity</em> dwells <em>bodily</em> in Christ. In the Greek sentence structure, Paul emphasized the words <em>in Christ</em> (literally: “in him”). You may be able to express this: “For it is in Christ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and in Christ alone</span> that all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>all the fullness of the Deity:</strong> See the note on 1:19. When Paul said that <em>all the fullness of the Deity</em> is in Christ, this implied that Christ alone has all the power and authority that God has.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Deity:</strong> The Greek word <em>theotēs</em> that the BSB translates <em>Deity</em> comes from the Greek word <em>theos</em> “God.” It means all that God is: his nature, his power, and his perfection. So when Paul said that “all the fullness of the Deity” lived in Christ, he meant that Christ is fully God. All that God is, Christ is also.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>dwells:</strong> The Greek verb <em>katoikeō</em> that the BSB translates <em>dwells</em> means, “stays, lives, remains.” Paul used the same verb in 1:19, but there he used a past tense. Here he used the present tense, and so it means that all God’s nature <u>is now permanently</u> in Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in bodily form:</strong> This refers to the fact that Christ was born and he became a human being with a human body. Even then, Christ had all of God’s nature in him.</p>",

You should keep this figure of speech in your translation if possible. Paul used this figure of speech for two reasons:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>When the Jews circumcised a baby boy, they removed a piece of skin, and Paul was comparing this to Christ removing the sinful nature of those who believe in him.</p></li><li><p>Also, circumcision was the rite that marked the Jews as God’s people. When a boy was circumcised, this was the sign that he was part of God’s people, the Jews. Here Paul was saying that the Colossian Christians did not become the people of God because someone physically circumcised them, but because Christ freed them from the old sinful way they used to behave.</p></li></ol><h4>2:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in the putting off of your sinful nature,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and your sinful nature was removed.</p></li><li><p>and you were freed from the power of your evil desires.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the putting off of your sinful nature:</strong> The Greek word <em>apekdusis</em> that the BSB translates as <em>putting off</em> is used for “removing, stripping off” something, such as clothes. In this context Paul used it as a figure of speech. When a person is circumcised, the priest removes a piece of skin from his body. In the same way, when a person is united with Christ, Christ removes his sinful nature.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sinful nature:</strong> Literally “body of flesh.” Paul was referring to human nature, which is naturally sinful. GNT translates it, “this sinful self” (see 2:11 in GNT). If it is not possible in your language to talk about “removing” sins, you can say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he freed us from the power that sin has in our hearts</p></blockquote><h4>2:11c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:11c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>with the circumcision performed by Christ</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It was Christ who removed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">your sinful nature</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with the circumcision performed by Christ:</strong> Paul said it was Christ who removed a person’s sinful nature.

You need to make this main point clear in your translation.</p></div><h4>2:12</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:11 Paul used circumcision as a figure of speech to describe what Christ does when a person becomes a Christian: he removes the person’s old, sinful nature. In 2:12 Paul used a different figure of speech: baptism. Baptism also describes and symbolizes what happens when a person becomes a Christian, but it includes something extra. In baptism, not only is the old, sinful nature put to death, but also God gives the person a new nature. Paul compared the death of the old sinful nature and the receiving of the new nature to the death and resurrection of Christ.</p><h4>2:12a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:12a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And having been buried with Him in baptism,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>When you were baptized, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">it showed that your sinful nature</span> was buried just like Christ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">was buried</span>,</p></li><li><p>When you were baptized, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">it was as if</span> you had <span data-bnType=\"implied\">died and</span> been buried with Christ,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And having been buried with Him in baptism:</strong> Paul compared the death of a person’s old sinful nature to Christ’s death and burial. Here Paul said that when a Christian is baptized, the act of going into the water is like being buried. In 2:12b he said that the act of coming out of the water is like rising from death. Therefore, baptism shows what happens when a person becomes a Christian—his old nature dies and he receives a new nature.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Since Paul was not writing about being literally buried, in your translation you may want to say something like this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When you were baptized, it is as if you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">died and</span> were buried together with Christ,</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You may also want to repeat your translation of the phrase “sinful nature” from 2:11 in your translation as follows:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When you were baptized, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">your sinful nature died and</span> was buried just like Christ,</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>with Him:</strong> The phrase <em>with Him</em> means “together with Christ” or “just like Christ.” It shows that Christians identify with Christ. Be careful not to translate this phrase in a way that implies that Christians were buried beside/alongside Christ at the same time as he was.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in baptism:</strong> This means “When you were baptized…,” or “At the time of your baptism…”</p><h4>2:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>you were raised with Him</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and you were raised <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with a new nature</span> just like Christ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">was raised to life</span>.</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">then it was as if</span> you had been raised <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from death</span> with him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you were raised with Him:</strong> The BSB implies that the phrase “in baptism” is only connected to the verb “buried.” However, in Greek this phrase actually is connected to the verb <em>raised</em> in 2:12b as well as to the verb “buried” in 2:12a. Therefore, Paul was comparing a person coming out of the water after being baptized to someone rising from the dead. This is the second part of Paul’s figure of speech. Paul was comparing the way God raised Jesus from death with the way he gives a new nature to believers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>with Him:</strong> As in 2:12b, this phrase <em>with Him</em> shows that people who are baptized identify with Christ. It does not mean that people were raised from the dead at the same time as Christ was.</p><h4>2:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>through your faith in the power of God, who raised Him from the dead.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This happened to you</span> because you believed that God who raised Christ to life had the power <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to do it</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This happened</span> because you believed that God’s power to raise Christ from the dead would raise you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with a new nature</span> also.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This happened</span> because you believed that God, by his power, raised Christ to life again after he had died.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>through your faith in the power of God, who raised Him from the dead:</strong> This means that believers are given a new nature by believing that God has the power to do it just as he had the power to raise Jesus from the dead.</p>",

You need to make this main point clear in your translation.</p></div><h4>2:13–15</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek, 2:13–15 is one long, complicated sentence. Most English versions divide it into several sentences. You will probably need to do this in your translation, too.</p><h4>2:13a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:13a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>When you were dead in your trespasses</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And as for you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Gentiles, before you believed in Christ</span> you were <span data-bnType=\"implied\">spiritually</span> dead because you were sinful,</p></li><li><p>You <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who are not Jews</span> were separated from God because you had broken God’s laws,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you:</strong> Paul used an emphatic pronoun <em>you</em> here. In English, this can be expressed “It was you…” If you have special pronouns in your language to show such emphasis, you should use one here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>dead in your trespasses:</strong> Paul was writing about what the Colossians were like before they believed in Jesus. This is a figure of speech that means, “you were spiritually dead because you were continually behaving in sinful ways.” Because of the sinful things they did, it was not possible for them to have eternal life and be with God forever.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you want to keep the figure of speech <em>dead</em> in your translation, you may need to clarify that Paul was not writing about physical death. For example, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">it was as if</span> you were dead</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you were dead spiritually</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you cannot keep the figure of speech in your translation, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you were separated from God because you had sinned</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>trespasses:</strong> Paul did not use the normal Greek word for <em>trespasses</em> here, but he used the word <em>paraptōma</em>, which means “transgressions, actions that break the law.” Most modern English versions use the word “sins.” Unless you have a word that specifically means “transgressions,” you should probably also use your normal term for “sins” in this verse.</p><h4>2:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and because you were not free from the power of your sinful nature.</p></li><li><p>and because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God had</span> not yet removed your sinful nature.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature:</strong> Here Paul gave a second reason why the Colossians had been dead spiritually. There are two main interpretations of this part of the verse:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some scholars think that Paul was talking about <u>spiritual</u> circumcision, as in 2:11. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you were uncircumcised <span data-bnType=\"implied\">spiritually</span>, that is, you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">were controlled</span> by your evil nature (SSA)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your sinful nature was not yet cut away (NLT) <em>(GW, NCV, NLT, SSA)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Some scholars think that Paul meant <u>literal</u> circumcision, that is, that the Colossians were Gentiles and so had not been circumcised according to the law of Moses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you were Gentiles without the Law (GNT) <em>(GNT, NJB, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Both interpretations have strong commentary support. The Display follows the first interpretation—that Paul used the term <em>uncircumcision</em> as a figure of speech, similar to 2:11. The <em>uncircumcision of your sinful nature</em> means “your sinful nature had not been removed,” or “God had not freed you from the power of your sinful nature.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, if you want to follow the second interpretation, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You were spiritually dead…because you were Gentiles and did not know God.</p></blockquote><h4>2:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>God made you alive with Christ.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But God raised you up to live <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a new life</span> with Christ.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">But even though you were like that,</span> God gave you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">new spiritual</span> life<span data-bnType=\"implied\">. It was just as if he caused you to live again, together</span> with Christ.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God made you alive with Christ:</strong> This is similar to what Paul said in 2:12b: “[you were] raised with him/[Christ].” Paul was saying that although the Colossians had been spiritually dead (2:13a), when they became Christians, God made them spiritually alive.</p><h4>2:13d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:13d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He forgave us all our trespasses,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>God forgave us<sup>(incl)</sup> for all our sins.</p></li><li><p>He forgave us<sup>(incl)</sup> for all the sinful things that we<sup>(incl)</sup> had done.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He forgave us all our trespasses:</strong> <em>He</em> refers to God.

Here it is used as a figure of speech. Paul was using legal language to explain how God sets people free from the guilt that is the result of sin. In the court, a person’s debts were written either on a papyrus or on a clay tablet. When the debts were paid, the papyrus or clay tablet was wiped clean and there was no more record of debts or charges against the person.</p></li><li><p>The BSB phrase <em>the debt</em> refers to the written Jewish law with all of its many regulations. Paul was saying that the law was against us and opposed to us because God condemned the people who did not obey these regulations. Therefore, when Christ died on the cross, God broke the power that the law has.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">There are valid reasons to choose either of these interpretations. The Display follows the first option (1) for the following reasons:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Greek word that the BSB translates <em>the debt</em> was a common term used in Greek courts. It was a written statement of the charges against a person. The Greek word that the BSB translates <em>decrees</em> usually referred to an official proclamation of the charges against the person. Therefore, it appears to refer to the official written statement of the charges against sinners.</p></li><li><p>The words that Paul used about the document being <em>canceled</em> and “taken away” seem too strong to refer to what happened to the law of Moses when Christ died. Jesus himself said that he did not come to destroy the Law but to fulfill it (Matthew 5:17).</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>canceled:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates <em>canceled</em> means “to erase, wipe out.” When God forgives someone, it is as if he “erases” everything that was written down about that person—all his sins and guilt.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that stood against us:</strong> In Greek Paul says that “the debt ascribed to us in the decrees” was <em>against us</em> and “stood opposed to us” (NIV). These two phrases are similar and it is difficult to find a difference between them. So most modern English versions combine them into one phrase, like the BSB’s <em>stood against us</em>. (See GNT, GW, RSV, CEV, NCV, NJB, NLT.) Unless you have a clear way to make a difference between the two phrases, you should follow one of these versions. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the charges which were brought against us (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>2:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He took it away, nailing it to the cross!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">That is, it was as if</span> he destroyed that record by nailing it to the cross <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when Jesus died</span>.</p></li><li><p>He removed that document <span data-bnType=\"implied\">completely</span> when Christ was nailed to the cross <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and died</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>nailing it to the cross!:</strong> This is another figure of speech. There were no lists of sins nailed to the cross on which Jesus died. However, when Christ was nailed to the cross he suffered the punishment for the sins of all people. So it was as if everyone’s sins were nailed to the cross in the body of Christ. If your readers are confused by this figure of speech, you could try translating this part of the verse without using the figure of speech; see the second meaning line in the Display for one way to do this.</p>",

See the notes about these verses. Paul was referring to spirit powers and authorities who were against God and who were controlling people. See also Ephesians 6:12.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>disarmed:</strong> The Greek word <em>apekdumai</em> that the BSB translates <em>disarmed</em> means “to undress.” In this context it means that God took away the power from these “powers and authorities.”</p><h4>2:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>he showed everyone that he had defeated them by means of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ dying on</span> the cross.</p></li><li><p>he let it be known openly that Christ had defeated those evil spirits <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when he died</span> on the cross.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He made a public spectacle of them:</strong> This means that God shamed the powers and authorities publicly, and he made it obvious to everyone that he had defeated them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>He:</strong> Scholars do not agree about who this pronoun “he” refers to:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Most scholars say that it is <u>God</u>. It was God who “made a public spectacle of” the powers and authorities, in the same way that he “made you alive with Christ” (2:13c). This is how most English versions translate this verse. <em>(BSB, NIV, RSV, GW, NCV, NLT, REB, SSA)</em></p></li><li><p>Some scholars say that <u>Christ</u> is the subject of the verb “triumphing over” (and therefore of the verb “disarmed” in 2:15a). See GNT and CEV.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The first option is recommended (1). It is clear that God is the subject of all the main verbs in 2:13–14. If Paul had changed the subject of the verbs in 2:15 to Christ, he probably would have clarified this by using a noun (Christ) rather than a pronoun <em>He</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>triumphing over them:</strong> The Greek verb <em>thriambeuō</em> that the BSB translates as <em>triumphing over</em> means “to lead in a victory parade.” Paul may have been thinking about the way, after a great victory, a Roman general would lead his prisoners of war in a public procession through the streets of the city of Rome. This is how several English versions translate it (see 2:15 in GNT, CEV, NJB, REB). When Christ died on the cross, it showed openly that God had defeated Satan and all the evil powers. It was as if God had captured them and was parading them for everyone to see.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by the cross:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>the cross</em> is an ambiguous pronoun. It could mean “it” or “him.” It could refer to one of two things:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It could refer to <u>the cross</u>. <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, CEV, KJV, NCV, NLT, NRSV, REB).</em></p></li><li><p>It could refer to <u>Christ</u>. <em>(RSV, GW, NJB, SSA).</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The commentaries are equally divided about which of these two options they support, so both options are possible. The meaning is almost the same—God triumphed by Christ and his death on the cross.</p>",

If you need to clarify this connection to the previous paragraph, you could begin this paragraph: “So then, based on what I have said, I urge you…”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>let no one judge you:</strong> Apparently there were people in Colossae who believed and taught that Christians must obey certain laws and customs.

Another way to say this is “Do not pay attention to people who criticize you…”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>no one:</strong> In some languages it may be better to translate this using a plural: “Do not let any people criticize you…” Paul was referring to any person or group of people that was criticizing the believers in Colossae and trying to make them believe that they needed to do more than just believe in Christ in order to be saved.</p><h4>2:16b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:16b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>by what you eat or drink,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">do not obey their rules that forbid people from</span> eating or drinking certain things,</p></li><li><p>because you eat certain foods or drink certain drinks <span data-bnType=\"implied\">which they say you should not</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by what you eat or drink:</strong> These false teachers were saying that people should not eat certain foods or drink certain drinks.

If you have words in your language for these kind of food taboos, you may be able to use those terms here.</p><h4>2:16c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:16c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>or with regard to a feast, a New Moon, or a Sabbath.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>or because you do not participate in certain celebrations like their <span data-bnType=\"implied\">annual</span> religious festivals, or <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when they celebrate</span> the new moon, or the Sabbath.</p></li><li><p>or because you do not celebrate their religious festivals, or <span data-bnType=\"implied\">celebrate with them when</span> the new moon <span data-bnType=\"implied\">appears</span>, or <span data-bnType=\"implied\">keep</span> the Sabbath <span data-bnType=\"implied\">day like they do</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>or with regard to a feast, a New Moon, or a Sabbath:</strong> The false teachers also taught that, in order to be holy, people must obey rules about what they could do on certain days.

If you want to follow the second meaning in your translation, you could translate 2:18a–b like this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Do not allow anyone to condemn you because you do not humble yourselves and worship angels <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like they do</span>.</p></blockquote><h4>2:18c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:18c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>with speculation about what he has seen.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>A person <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who teaches like that</span> bases his authority <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to teach these things</span> on visions which he claims to have seen.</p></li><li><p>These people say that they have special knowledge about God because they have seen visions.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with speculation:</strong> The Greek word <em>embateuō</em> that the BSB translates as <em>with speculation</em> does not occur anywhere else in the NT. Its primary meaning is “to step on” or “to frequent.” However, it can also mean:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“To take a stand on.” That is, these people claimed that they had authority to teach these things because of the visions they had seen. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>anyone who claims to be superior because he has seen special visions (GNT) <em>(GNT, RSV, SSA)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>“To investigate,” and therefore to continue to give many details about what they had seen. <em>(NIV, CEV, GW, NET, NRSV)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Both these meanings are possible. The Display uses the first option (1), which fits the context well.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>about what he has seen:</strong> Paul was referring to the visions that these false teachers said they had seen.</p><h4>2:18d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:18d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Such a person is puffed up without basis by his unspiritual mind.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He is very proud of all the ideas he has invented. But he has no reason to be proud.</p></li><li><p>His ideas come from his own mind, and they cause him to be proud. But actually he does not have any reason to be proud.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Such a person:</strong> As he did in 2:16a and 2:18a, Paul was not writing about only one <em>person</em>, but about any <em>person</em> or group of people who taught these false teachings. You can use either a singular or a plural here, whichever is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>is puffed up:</strong> This means “to be proud” but in a negative way, that is, it means “to think of oneself as better than other people.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>without basis:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates <em>without basis</em> means “at random, for no purpose/reason.” It means these people were proud even though there was no reason for them to be proud.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>his unspiritual mind:</strong> Paul said that this kind of person became proud because of <em>his unspiritual mind</em> (literally: “the mind of his flesh”). This can be interpreted in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The phrase <em>his unspiritual mind</em> means “his human way of thinking”. In other words, these people were proud because of ideas they thought up themselves. <em>(BSB, GNT, NCV, NRSV, REB)</em></p></li><li><p>“Flesh” means “sinful nature.” So this phrase means that these people were proud “because of their sinful thoughts”. <em>(CEV, GW, NET, NLT, SSA)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Both these interpretations are acceptable. The Display follows the first one (1). Paul’s point was that these people were proud because of their own thoughts, thoughts that came from their own worldly minds, not from God.</p>",

There are two ways to understand this figure of speech:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Paul meant that such people did not “hold firmly to the true teachings about Christ.” This means that they did not faithfully believe and teach what is true about Christ.</p></li><li><p>Paul meant that such people no longer trusted in Christ to save them. This could be translated: “he is no longer loyal to Christ,” or “he ceases to depend on Christ” (UBS Handbook).</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The first interpretation is recommended (1) because it fits best with the warning Paul was giving the Colossian believers in this letter—that they should not follow the <u>false teachings</u> these people taught.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>head:</strong> This refers to Christ. The figure of speech here is the same as in 1:18a; that is, Christ is like the head of a body, and his people, Christians, are like the body. In your translation, you should translate this figure of speech here like you did in 1:18.</p><h4>2:19b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:19b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>from whom the whole body, supported and knit together by its joints and ligaments, grows</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Just as a head directs a body, so Christ directs all his people so they remain united and held together as ligaments and sinews hold a body together,</p></li><li><p>It is Christ who causes his people to grow spiritually just like the head causes the body to grow physically. He joins it together by ligaments and sinews,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>from whom the whole body…grows:</strong> The words <em>from whom</em> mean “from Christ.” Paul said that Christ controls the spiritual growth of the church in the same way that the head of a person controls the physical growth of his body. One way to say this is “It is only by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">being connected/united to</span> Christ that the whole body grows.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the whole body:</strong> This means the whole body of Christ, which means the church, all believers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>grows:</strong> In this context <em>grows</em> means “to grow spiritually,” “to continue to know God more and more,” or “to continue to understand more about God.” It does <u>not</u> mean, “to grow numerically,” that is, to have more and more people become Christians.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>supported and knit together by its joints and ligaments:</strong> The Greek words that the BSB translates <em>joints and ligaments</em> refer to the tough, stringy parts inside the body that connect all the other parts together. Paul was saying that just as joints and ligaments support and join together the parts of the body, so the church is held together and supported by Christ’s control.</p><h4>2:19c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:19c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>as God causes it to grow.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and it grows the way God has planned.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as God causes it to grow:</strong> The Greek literally says, “grows a growth of God.” This can mean:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The growth is the way God has planned/desired.

If you use footnotes or cross-references, you may want to include references here to Romans 6:1–11 and Galatians 5:19–20.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>If:</strong> The Greek begins with a word that the BSB translates literally as <em>If</em>. However, Paul was not questioning or wondering <u>if</u> the Colossians believers had died with Christ or not. He knew that it <u>was</u> true. “Since” is another way to translate this word in English. You should use a word in your language that expresses that something is certain/true.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>have died with Christ to:</strong> Paul said that the Colossian believers had <em>died with Christ</em> <u>to</u> these rules. This means that they had been freed from these laws, and now the laws no longer had any control over them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to the spiritual forces of the world:</strong> This phrase <em>spiritual forces of the world</em> is the same as in 2:8d. It has the same meaning here as in 2:8d—“the elementary principles and rules of life.” See the note on 2:8d for the alternative interpretation.</p><h4>2:20b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:20b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>why, as though you still belonged to the world, do you submit to its regulations:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Therefore why do you still obey these rules as if the world still controlled you?</p></li><li><p>Therefore do not continue obeying these rules like those who have not been freed from the world’s control.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>why…do you submit to its regulations:</strong> This is Paul’s <u>main point</u> in this paragraph (2:20–23). He was telling the Colossian believers that they did not need to submit to the rules that the false teachers were teaching them. Paul used a rhetorical question here to emphasize that the Colossians did not need to submit to these rules. If you do not use rhetorical questions in this way in your language, it may be better to translate this rhetorical question as a command, such as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not obey…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“You do not need to obey…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as though you still belonged to the world:</strong> This means to behave “as if the world were still controlling the way you behave” (rather than in the way someone who belongs to God should behave).

You must clarify this in your translation so that your readers do not think that Paul was commanding the Colossian believers not to touch or taste certain things. The BSB shows this by using quote marks, but it may be better in your language to begin the verse with an introductory phrase like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>There are people who teach you rules like this: “Do not handle…”</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You do not have to follow rules that say, “Do not handle…”</p></blockquote></div>",

They should not believe any other message.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1052002020\" data-endVerseId=\"1052002023\"><h3>Paragraph 2:20–23</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Theme: Paul warned the Colossians that they should not obey once more all those regulations that were based only on human ideas. They had abandoned that old way of living.</p></div><h4>2:23a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:23a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Such restrictions indeed have an appearance of wisdom,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>These rules do indeed appear to be wise,</p></li><li><p>These rules seem to show a wise way to behave,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>have an appearance of wisdom:</strong> Or “…have a reputation for wisdom.” Paul was saying that these rules <u>seemed</u> to be wise—but they were <u>not</u>. They appeared to be rules that taught people the correct way to behave, but (2:23e) they did not succeed.</p><h4>2:23b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:23b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>with their self-prescribed worship,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>for <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they teach people</span> to be willing to do things that require great effort in order to show that they are devoted to God,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>self-prescribed worship:</strong> The first “wise” rule that Paul specified concerned <em>self-prescribed worship</em>. The meaning of the Greek word is difficult to understand, so English versions translate it in many different ways. The basic meaning seems to be that the people attempt to please God by willingly forcing themselves to follow difficult religious rules.</p><h4>2:23c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:23c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>their false humility,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to humble themselves,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>their false humility:</strong> See the note on verse 2:18a.</p><h4>2:23d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:23d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and their harsh treatment of the body;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and to treat their bodies harshly.</p></li><li><p>and to make themselves suffer <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because they think this will please God</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>their harsh treatment of the body:</strong> These rules also told people to treat their bodies harshly. This included fasting or only eating poor food, forcing themselves to stay awake for a long time, sitting outside in the cold for a long time, or beating themselves. People did things like these because they thought that by doing them they could please God.</p><h4>2:23e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:23e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but they are of no value against the indulgence of the flesh.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But in fact these rules do not help people to control their evil desires.</p></li><li><p>But even when people obey these rules, they still cannot stop behaving sinfully.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but they are of no value against the indulgence of the flesh:</strong> This means: “But these rules are useless. They cannot help people to control their evil desires.” This part of the verse contrasts with 2:23a. Paul was saying, “these rules seem to be wise but they are actually useless.”</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment for 2:23</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages you can clarify the contrast in this verse by rearranging it. One way to do this would be:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>These rules tell you to willingly submit to strict religious rites, humble yourselves, and make your bodies suffer in order to please God. This may seem like a wise way to behave, but actually these rules do not help people to control their evil desires.</p></blockquote></div>",

See the note on that verse.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">As in 2:12, you may need to clarify that Paul was using a figure of speech here. He did not mean that the Colossians had been physically raised from the dead. He was saying that they had been given new, spiritual life when they trusted in Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Therefore:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates literally as <em>Therefore</em> indicates that what follows is what Paul wants his readers to do as a result of what he has stated in the previous chapters.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>since:</strong> See the note on 2:20a. Once again Paul used a Greek word that literally means “if.” However, he was not saying that the Colossians may or may not have been “raised with Christ”; rather, he was stating what he believed to be true.</p><h4>3:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>strive for the things above,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>be constantly wanting what is associated with heaven.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">so I urge you to</span> always desire to behave as people who belong to heaven should behave.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>strive for the things above:</strong> This is Paul’s <u>main command</u> in this paragraph (3:1–4). He repeated almost the same words in 3:2a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>strive for:</strong> This phrase in English comes from one Greek word that means “seek, try to find.” In this context it means, “to strive for, aim at.” It describes truly desiring something. In Greek this verb is in the present tense, so it means “be constantly wanting.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the things above:</strong> This means “things associated with heaven.” However, the <em>things</em> Paul referred to were not <u>objects</u> associated with heaven, but spiritual <u>values</u> associated with heaven that should be demonstrated in the behavior of Christians (such as those listed in 3:12–14).</p><h4>3:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>There <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in heaven</span> Christ is now sitting on the right side of God, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">which is the place of honor and authority</span>.</p></li><li><p>That is where Christ is sitting in the most honored place next to God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the right hand of God:</strong> To sit at the <em>right hand</em> of a ruler is a figure of speech that means to be given the place of greatest honor and power.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">These words refer to Psalm 110:1, a verse that is quoted many times in the NT. You need to translate it here like you translated it elsewhere (see Matthew 22:44, Mark 12:36, Luke 20:42, Acts 2:34, Hebrews 1:13).

There are two main interpretations:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to the <u>state</u> of Christ and his followers when they appear, that is, they will all have “glorious” bodies, perfect and free from sin.</p></li><li><p>It refers to the <u>manner</u> in which Christ and his followers will appear. When Christ returns, he will come with all God’s visible glory—the brightness and light of heaven. The believers who are with him will share this glory.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">In Colossae the false teachers were teaching that the only way for Christians to be perfect was to obey all the rules they were taught. It seems that Paul was saying that when believers appear with Christ, everyone will see that they are perfect and free from sin. The perfection is because they have died with Christ and were raised with him (3:1,3), not because of any rules they have obeyed. Therefore, it is recommended that you follow the first interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It probably will not be possible to include the complete meaning of this phrase in your translation. One way to include both interpretations is to say, “share his glory” (GNT, NCV, NLT). Also, see “glory” in KBT and meaning 3 in the glossary for more information.</p>",

Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So put all evil things out of your life (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>therefore:</strong> This word connects this paragraph to what Paul had said before.

These paragraphs described the new life the Colossians now had because they had trusted in Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the components of your earthly nature:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>earthly</em> is literally “on the earth.” It is the same phrase Paul used in 3:2b. It means the evil deeds and desires that come from the old sinful nature. Paul was telling the Colossians that they must put to death anything that belongs to that old sinful nature. In other words, they should no longer behave the way they used to behave before they trusted in Christ.</p><h4>3:5b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 3:5b–c Paul lists five kinds of evil behavior as examples of “the components of your earthly nature.”</p><h4>3:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Do not be</span> sexually immoral, do not do any sort of sexually unclean/indecent act, and do not desire to do such things. Do not desire to do <span data-bnType=\"implied\">any other sort of</span> evil.</p></li><li><p>Do not behave immorally in any way. Do not be controlled by a desire to behave like this or in any other evil way.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>sexual immorality, impurity, lust:</strong> The first three kinds of evil behavior that Paul listed were sexual sins.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sexual immorality:</strong> The Greek word <em>porneia</em> that the BSB translates <em>sexual immorality</em> is a general term that means any kind of unlawful sexual behavior. This includes people having sex before they are married or having sex with someone other than their own husband or wife.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>impurity:</strong> The second term, <em>impurity</em>, also refers to sexual sin. It is often mentioned together with <em>porneia</em>, “sexual immorality,” in the NT. It can be translated, “doing indecent things,” or “doing shameful things.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>lust:</strong> The last term, <em>lust</em>, means “strong desire, passion.” In this verse, it probably means strong sexual desire.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is difficult to make differences between these three terms in some languages. If you do not have different terms for each of these ideas in your language, here are some ways you could combine them:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Do not commit adultery or do other deeds that people are ashamed to talk about.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Do not behave in any sort of sexually immoral way.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>evil desires:</strong> The fourth term, <em>evil desires</em>, is a general term. It probably refers not only to evil <u>sexual</u> desires, but also to any kind of evil desire. Here is another way to translate this term:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not desire to do what is evil (SSA)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Since Paul has just referred to sexual sins, you may want to translate it like this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and do not desire to do <u>other</u> kinds of evil</p></blockquote><h4>3:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and greed, which is idolatry.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Do not desire to have many possessions. That is just like worshiping the things <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you desire</span>.</p></li><li><p>Do not be greedy <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for more and more things</span>. If you are greedy, it is like you are worshipping idols.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>greed:</strong> The fifth term, <em>greed</em>, means desiring to get more and more things, such as money or other possessions.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>which is idolatry:</strong> Paul said here that “greed” is the same as <em>idolatry</em>. Idolatry usually means, “the worship of idols rather than God.”</p>",

Here Paul was using it as an idiom. It means almost the same thing as “Put to death” in 3:5a: “Do not do any of these things any more.” This same idiom is used in Romans 13:12; Ephesians 4:22, 4:25; 1 Peter 2:1; and James 1:21.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>all such things as these:</strong> It is possible that <em>all such things</em> refers back to the list of evil things in 3:5. But most scholars and translations say that these words refer forward to the evil things that Paul listed in 3:8b and 3:9.</p><h4>3:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Do not be angry in any way.

Avoid hurting people by what you do or say, and never use any sort of unclean/vile language.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>anger, rage:</strong> These two words, <em>anger</em> and <em>rage</em>, mean almost the same thing. If you have two synonyms in your language for anger, you can use them here, otherwise you can combine the two words and say, “do not be angry in any way.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>malice:</strong> To act with <em>malice</em> means to act in wicked, hateful ways, to do things to people just to be unkind. Here is another way to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>hateful feelings (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>slander:</strong> This means to say hateful, unkind, insulting things about people. This may mean telling lies about people, but it can also include saying true things about people, but with the intent to hurt them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>filthy language:</strong> This probably refers to obscene talk or cursing. If you do not have an expression in your language for speaking in this offensive or profane manner, you may be able to say, “using words that should not be spoken.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>from your lips:</strong> The Greek is literally “from your mouth.” Notice that the BSB, along with several other English versions, has translated the Greek word for “mouth” with <em>lips</em>. This is because in English it is more natural to refer to words being “on someone’s lips” than “in their mouth.” In other languages, it may be more natural to refer to the throat or the tongue. You should use the term that is most natural in your language.</p>",

Greeks/Gentiles were not circumcised.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If your language does not use a lot of parallel phrases, you could combine these two phrases and say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It does not matter if you are a Jew, circumcised <span data-bnType=\"implied\">according to the law of Moses</span>, or an uncircumcised Gentile…</p></blockquote><h4>3:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>barbarian, Scythian, slave, or free,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It does not matter if you are</span> a foreigner or from uncivilized people. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">It does not matter if you are</span> a slave or a free person.</p></li><li><p>It is not important whether you are foreign or uncivilized, a slave or someone who is not a slave.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>barbarian:</strong> The Greeks called any person who was not Greek a <em>barbarian</em>. It means “foreigner” and implies someone who was uncultured.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Scythian:</strong> The Scythians were a fierce, savage people who invaded other peoples’ countries and killed the occupants and caused other sorts of damage. People were afraid of them and considered them one of the worst kinds of “barbarians.” You can translate this using a term in your language that refers to people who are primitive or uncivilized.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>slave:</strong> A <em>slave</em> was a servant who had been bought by someone and therefore belonged to this person. He had no freedom to do what he wanted to do or to go where he wanted to go. He had no possessions of his own and was completely dependent on his owners for everything.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>free:</strong> This is the opposite of a “slave.” The word <em>free</em> can be translated as “free person,” or “person who is not a slave.”</p><h4>3:11c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:11c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but Christ is all</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It is Christ who is supremely important,</p></li><li><p>But Christ is the only thing that matters,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but Christ is all:</strong> This contrasts with 3:11a–b. Paul was saying that all these differences between people did not matter—the only thing that was important was Christ. He is the most important thing in the universe, he is supreme over all things and over all people.</p><h4>3:11d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:11d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and is in all.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and he lives in each one <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of you</span>.</p></li><li><p>and he lives in all <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his people</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and is in all:</strong> Most scholars believe that this means that Christ “lives in all believers.” The CEV, NCV, and NLT make this explicit in their translation.</p>",

First he reminded them that they were <em>the elect of God</em>, that is, that God had chosen them to belong to him and be part of his people.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>holy:</strong> Second, he reminded them that they were <em>holy</em>. In this context, it means “set apart, dedicated specially to God.” See the term “holy” in KBT and meaning 1 in the glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>beloved:</strong> Third, Paul reminded them that they were <em>beloved</em>. In this context, it means, “<u>God</u> loves you.”</p><h4>3:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>clothe yourselves with hearts of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>be compassionate, kind, humble, gentle, and patient.</p></li><li><p>help people who are suffering, be kind <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to one another,</span> be humble, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">do not insist that others do what you want but</span> be considerate <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of one another</span>, be patient.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>clothe yourselves:</strong> This is the same verb that Paul used in 3:10a (where the BSB translated it as “put on”). See the notes there. If you cannot use such a figure of speech in your language, you can translate the meaning directly: “Behave in these ways:…”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul then listed five ways the Colossians should behave. In some languages it will be necessary to translate each of these five nouns as a short sentence.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>hearts of compassion:</strong> This means feelings of sympathy towards someone who needs help, showing concern for someone who needs help.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>kindness:</strong> This is similar to “compassion.” It means acting in helpful, loving ways toward people.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>humility:</strong> This is the same Greek word that Paul used in 2:18a and 2:23c. There the BSB translated it “<u>false</u> humility.” However, here it has a positive meaning. It means not being proud and arrogant. A person shows <em>humility</em> when he does not act as if he is better than other people.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>gentleness:</strong> This means being willing to yield to others. A person shows <em>gentleness</em> when he is considerate of the rights and feelings of other people and does not insist on having his own way.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>patience:</strong> This means calmly enduring unfair or unkind treatment by others—not becoming angry quickly when other people do something unpleasant. In the next sentence (3:13a), Paul used different words that mean almost the same thing as “being patient.”</p>",

Paul was continuing his figure of speech of putting on clothes. Paul was saying that <em>love</em> was like another piece of clothing that a believer was to put on over his other clothes to “bind them all together.” If you cannot use this figure of speech in your translation, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And above everything else, be truly loving….

Christ has caused Christians to be at peace with God and with one another.

So one way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ has caused you to be at peace with one another.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>peace:</strong> In this context, <em>peace</em> means “the ability to be in harmony with one another.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>rule:</strong> The Greek word <em>brabeuō</em> that the BSB translates <em>rule</em> means “to direct, control.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in your hearts:</strong> This can mean either:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>among you, as a group, or</p></li><li><p>within each of you, as individuals.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Since Paul’s next phrase reminded the Colossian believers that God expected them to live peacefully with one another, the first interpretation is preferred (1).</p><h4>3:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for to this you were called as members of one body.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Do this</span> since all of you are parts of the same body and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> chose you so that you could live peacefully <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with one another</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You should do this</span> since God has chosen each one of you to live <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and work</span> together peacefully as one body.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for to this you were called:</strong> To be <em>called</em> means “God chose you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be his people</span> so that you will be at peace with one another.” Paul was giving the basis for telling the Colossians why they should always try to live peacefully with other Christians, that is, they should do this, for one of God’s purposes in choosing them was so that they would live peacefully with one another.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as members of one body:</strong> Paul used this phrase before—see the note on 1:18a.

In 3:16b–c he follows this command with three verbs: “teaching…counseling…singing.” These are specific ways in which the Colossians were to let the message dwell in them.</p><h4>3:16b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:16b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Specifically,</span> teach each other <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the message about Christ</span>, and warn/urge each other <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to obey it</span>. Do this as wisely as you can.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Do this</span> by teaching one another wisely <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the message about Christ</span> and counseling one another wisely.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>teach and admonish one another with all wisdom:</strong> 1:28b was very similar to this part of the verse. See the note there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>admonish:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates <em>admonish</em> means, “warn, admonish, instruct, advise.” Paul was still writing about “the word of Christ” from 3:16a. He was instructing the Colossians to warn each other to obey that message.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>with all wisdom:</strong> Here the meaning is clear: “Teach and advise each <u>other as wisely as you can</u>.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some translations connect the words “with all wisdom” to 3:16a. For example, NLT says “Let the words of Christ, in all their richness, live in your hearts and make you wise.” (See also KJV.) But most scholars think that the words “with all wisdom” should be connected to “teaching and admonishing” in 3:16b, as the BSB and most other translations have done.</span></span></p><h4>3:16c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:16c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and as you sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Sing psalms, hymns <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of praise to God</span>, and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other</span> sacred songs. And as you sing sincerely, be grateful to God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for all that he has done for you</span>.</p></li><li><p>Also, thank God by sincerely singing psalms, hymns of praise, and other songs <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about God and Christ</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and as you sing:</strong> This instruction from Paul is parallel to 3:16b. This was another specific example of how the Colossians were to let the word of Christ dwell in them richly.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs:</strong> Paul was describing three types of songs. It may not be easy to make a clear distinction between them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>psalms:</strong> Most scholars agree that <em>psalms</em> refer to parts of the book of Psalms in the OT.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>hymns:</strong> This Greek word, according to ancient Christian writings, refers to songs of praise to God and to Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>spiritual songs:</strong> This is where there is most disagreement. Some people say that these were songs emphasizing some point of Christian doctrine, others say they were unwritten songs that a person sang as the Holy Spirit inspired him .</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is probably best if you avoid being too specific in making a difference between these terms. If you do not have three different terms, you could combine two or more of these terms in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Sing all sorts of songs to praise God.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with gratitude in your hearts to God:</strong> The word <em>gratitude</em> means being grateful/thankful. In this verse, Paul was instructing the Colossians to “sing” <em>with gratitude</em>, that is, to be singing songs that express their thankfulness to God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in your hearts:</strong> This phrase can be connected to the rest of the verse in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is connected to “sing.” So Paul was instructing the Colossians to “sing” in their hearts. This probably does not mean to sing silently, but rather to sing sincerely, to express in their songs how they really felt. <em>(GW, REB, SSA)</em></p></li><li><p>It is connected to “gratitude.” This is how many English versions translate this part of the verse. <em>(BSB, NIV, RSV, RSV, CEV, NCV, NET, NJB, NLT)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The word order in the Greek text supports the first interpretation. Many commentaries support this also. So although many English versions follow the second interpretation, it is recommended that you follow the first interpretation (1).</p>",

They had no possessions of their own and were completely dependent on their owners for everything.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>obey…in everything:</strong> Paul told slaves to <em>obey</em> their masters <em>in everything</em>. This was the same command he gave to children in 3:20a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>your earthly masters:</strong> That is, your human masters. In Greek the same word <em>kurios</em> is used for both “Lord” and “master.” So when Paul told slaves to obey their <em>earthly masters</em>, it also reminded them that they had a heavenly master/Lord also (see 3:24b). Notice that in 4:1b Paul used the phrase “Master in heaven” to refer to Christ.</p><h4>3:22b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 3:22b–c Paul told slaves how and why (in what manner and for what reason) they were to obey their masters. In 3:22b he told them ways they should <u>not</u> behave, and in 3:22c he told them ways they <u>should</u> behave.</p><h4>3:22b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:22b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>not only to please them while they are watching,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Obey them all the time.</span> Do not just obey them when they are watching you and so they will praise you.</p></li><li><p>Do not only work <span data-bnType=\"implied\">well</span> when <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you know that</span> they are watching you and so that they will think well of you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not only to please them while they are watching:</strong> This means that a slave should obey his master not only when the master was watching him, but all the time.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul was not saying that it was wrong for a slave to work to please his master, but he meant that pleasing their master should not be the <u>only</u> reason for hard work. He clarifies this in the rest of this verse.</p><h4>3:22c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:22c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but with sincerity of heart and fear of the Lord.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But work sincerely <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all the time</span> because you honor the Lord.</p></li><li><p>But, since you respect the Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus</span>, serve your master sincerely.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but with sincerity of heart:</strong> Slaves should obey and do their work sincerely and honestly, that is, with no hidden motives, not just so their masters will praise them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>fear of the Lord:</strong> The BSB translates this Greek word literally as <em>fear</em>. However, you should avoid a translation that means, “because you are afraid of the Lord.” In this context, this Greek word means the respect/awe that a person feels because of how great the Lord is. Because of this, in many languages it is best to translate phrases about “fearing the Lord” as “honoring the Lord,” or “respecting the Lord.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Lord:</strong> Again this refers to the Lord Jesus.</p>",

Here are some other ways to translate this word in context:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>At the same time</u> pray also for us (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and include us in your prayers (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>us:</strong> This referred to Paul and his friends who were with him.</p><h4>4:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that God may open to us a door for the word,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>that God will give us<sup>(excl)</sup> the opportunity to preach</p></li><li><p>pray that God will make it possible for us<sup>(excl)</sup> to continue to preach,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that God may open to us a door for the word:</strong> This is a figure of speech.

Some ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>pray that God will make a way for us to spread his message (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Pray that God will give us opportunities to preach the message about Christ.</p></blockquote><h4>4:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that we<sup>(excl)</sup> can tell people this message about Christ, which they did not understand/know before.</p></li><li><p>so we<sup>(excl)</sup> can declare this message about Christ, which God had not fully revealed to people in the past.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the mystery of Christ:</strong> See the note on 1:26a.</p><h4>4:3d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:3d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for which I am in chains.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It is because I preached this message that I am in prison now.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for which:</strong> This refers back to “word” in 4:3b.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I am in chains:</strong> It is possible that Paul was bound or chained while he was in prison.

So ask God to help me to do that.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Pray that I may declare it clearly:</strong> The Greek word <em>phaneroō</em>, that the BSB translates <em>declare it clearly</em>, means “reveal, make known, make plain, tell clearly.” Paul used this same Greek verb in 1:26 and in 3:4. In 1:26, he used it to refer to God’s secret plan that he (God) had hidden and not revealed (made known) to people in the past. In 3:4 he used it to refer to the relationship between Christ and Christians, which is hidden now, but will be revealed (made known) when Christ returns. In both cases it means, “to tell <u>clearly</u> and <u>publicly</u>.” However, there are two ways to interpret it here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The emphasis is on “proclaiming <u>publicly</u>.” This part of the verse therefore means “Pray that I may proclaim the message <u>publicly</u>,” or “Pray that I will make the message known to people.” (See NET, SSA.)</p></li><li><p>The emphasis is on “proclaiming <u>clearly</u>.” This part of the verse therefore means “Pray that I may proclaim the message <u>clearly</u>.”</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Both of these are acceptable. Most translations use the word <em>clearly</em> here as the BSB has done, and so follow the second interpretation. However, since Paul, in 4:3–4, was again writing about revealing God’s secret plan, it is likely that the emphasis is on “publicly.” So the first interpretation is recommended (1).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as I should:</strong> Paul was asking people to pray that he would proclaim the message to many people because this was his duty (BSB, NIV, RSV, GNT, GW, NCV, REB, SSA). This means that Paul wanted to make sure he fulfilled his obligation to tell people about Christ.</p>",

Here it means, “to be mature spiritually.” That is, Epaphras had been praying that the Colossians would become mature Christians, strong in their faith. If they were spiritually mature, the false teachers would not easily persuade them to believe the false teaching.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>fully assured in the full will of God:</strong> Most scholars interpret this to mean, “very sure, completely confident, fully convinced.” In 2:2 Paul used the noun form of this same word. See the note about “full riches” in 2:2c. As stated above, these words are connected to the phrase <em>in the full will of God</em>. Epaphras had prayed that the Colossians would be “completely sure” about what God wanted them to do and believe.</p>",

So most people in Colossae could not read this letter for themselves. They listened while someone else read the letter to the group.</p><h4>4:16b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:16b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>make sure that it is also read in the church of the Laodiceans,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>make sure that someone also reads it to the Christians in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the town of</span> Laodicea.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">send it on to</span> the community of believers in Laodicea and tell them to read it also.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>make sure that it is also read in the church of the Laodiceans:</strong> The phrase the BSB uses, <em>make sure</em>, is an idiom in English. It means, “make certain that.” This is also the meaning of the Greek phrase. Paul was telling the Colossians that they must make sure that the believers in Laodicea also had an opportunity to read this letter.</p><h4>4:16c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:16c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and that you in turn read the letter from Laodicea.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Also, make sure that you read the letter <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that I wrote to the Christians</span> at Laodicea.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I have also sent a letter to the believers</span> in Laodicea.

The majority of commentators agree that this is the correct interpretation. Paul was referring to a letter he had written to the Christians in Laodicea. Unfortunately, a copy of this letter has never been found.</p>",

In this verse Paul wrote a message especially to him. Paul did not explain what work or ministry Archippus had, but he wanted to encourage Archippus to be faithful in his ministry.</p><h4>4:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“See to it that you complete the ministry you have received in the Lord.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“Make sure that you<sup>(sing)</sup> finish the job/ministry which the Lord has entrusted to you<sup>(sing)</sup>.”</p></li><li><p>“The Lord has given you<sup>(sing)</sup> a task to do. Make sure you<sup>(sing)</sup> do it.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>See to it:</strong> This means almost the same thing as “make sure that” in 4:16b. See the note there. Here are some ways you can translate it:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Make sure</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Be careful</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You must</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the ministry you have received in the Lord:</strong> There are two main possibilities about what Paul meant when he said that Archippus had received a ministry <em>in the Lord</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “the work the Lord gave you.” The Lord was the one who gave him the job. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Be sure to carry out the work the Lord gave you (NLT) <em>(CEV, NCV, NJB, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “the work you have received as one who is united to the Lord,” or “to serve the Lord,” or “as a Christian worker.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Be sure to finish the task you were given in the Lord’s service (GNT) <em>(GNT, GW, REB, SSA)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Either of these interpretations is acceptable. The Display follows the first one (1). If you prefer to follow the second one (2), you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Make sure you complete the task that you were given as the Lord’s servant.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the ministry:</strong> The Greek word <em>diakonia</em> that the BSB translates <em>ministry</em> is the word used for service or ministry within the Christian congregation. Paul did not explain what kind of work the Lord had given to Archippus, but he was definitely writing about something Archippus was to do within the Christian community, not work like farming.</p>",

But Paul wrote these last words himself so that the readers would know that the letter really did come from him.</p><h4>4:18b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:18b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Remember my chains.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Remember that I am in prison <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and pray for me</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Remember my chains:</strong> The word <em>chains</em> is a figure of speech meaning that Paul was a prisoner. But Paul was not simply reminding the Colossians that he was a prisoner. He was also reminding them to <u>pray for him</u> while he was a prisoner, as he had asked them to do in 4:3–4.</p><h4>4:18c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:18c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Grace be with you.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>May the Lord Jesus be gracious/kind to you.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I pray that</span> God will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">continue to</span> bless you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Grace be with you:</strong> Paul ended most of his letters with these words or similar words. You should translate these words in a similar way at the end of every letter where they occur. (See 1 Corinthians 16:23, 2 Corinthians 13:14, Galatians 5:18, Ephesians 6:24, Philippians 4:23, 1 Thessalonians 5:28, 2 Thessalonians 3:18, 1 Timothy 6:21, 2 Timothy 4:22, Titus 3:15, Philemon 25.) These words are a wish or a prayer. In some languages it may be necessary to include the words “I ask…” or “I pray…” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I pray that God will be kind to you. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I ask God to bless you.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul did not say explicitly to whose <em>Grace</em> he was referring. However, in your translation, it may be necessary for you to make this information explicit. Some English versions refer to “God’s grace” (GNT, CEV, GW, NLT). However, at the end of most of his other letters, Paul says “the grace of the Lord Jesus,” or “the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,” so it is acceptable to use either “God” or “Jesus” in your translation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">See also meaning 1 of “grace” in the glossary.</p>",
