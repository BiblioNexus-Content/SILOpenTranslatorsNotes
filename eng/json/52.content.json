Silas and Timothy <span data-bnType=\"implied\">join me in greeting you</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy:</strong> Paul was the author of the letter, but he added the names of Silvanus and Timothy because they had been with him when he went to Thessalonica. They also greeted the Thessalonians.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Silvanus:</strong> Like Paul himself, <em>Silvanus</em> had two names: Silvanus and Silas. Silas was his Hebrew name. <em>Silvanus</em> was probably the Latin form of Silas. The original Greek text used the Latin form “Silvanus” at the beginning of 1 and 2 Thessalonians and 1 Peter (see RSV). However, Luke used “Silas” when he wrote about him in Acts. The important thing when you are translating these passages is to make sure that your readers know that Silvanus and Silas were the same person. Many modern English versions do this by only using the name “Silas” in the text (as NIV and GNT have done) and having a footnote to say that the Greek text has <em>Silvanus</em>. Another possibility would be to use <em>Silvanus</em> in your translation and use a footnote to explain that he was the same person as Silas of Acts.</p><h4>1:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>To the church of the Thessalonians</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">who belong to</span> the group of believers <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who meet together</span> in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the town of</span> Thessalonica.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">who are</span> believers in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the town of</span> Thessalonica,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>To the church of the Thessalonians:</strong> There is no verb in the Greek text of this verse. You may need to include a verb such as “write” to make this phrase more natural in your language, for example,</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I,</span> Paul, along with Timothy and Silas <span data-bnType=\"implied\">write</span> to the church of the Thessalonians….</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the church:</strong> The Greek word <em>ekklēsia </em>, which is often translated as <em>church</em>, never refers to a building but rather to a group of Christians who regularly met together to worship God and the Lord Jesus Christ. Also see the word “church&quot;, sense 2 in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Thessalonians:</strong> The people to whom Paul was writing lived in the town called Thessalonica. Thessalonica had a population of about 200,000 people. This was considered a large town or city at that time in history.</p><h4>1:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Those are</span> united to God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who is</span> the Father and to the Lord Jesus Christ.</p></li><li><p>and who belong to God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">our<sup>(incl)</sup></span> Father and to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">our<sup>(incl)</sup></span> Lord Jesus Christ.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in:</strong> The word <em>in</em> is one of the most difficult words to translate accurately and naturally when it relates to a person (for example, <em>in God</em>) because its meaning depends on the context. Here it means “those who have a special relationship with God and the Lord Jesus Christ,” “those who are united with God and the Lord Jesus Christ” (GW), “those who belong to God and the Lord Jesus Christ” (GNT, NLT, REB).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God the Father:</strong> In some languages it is not possible to just say “the father.” Instead, it is necessary to specify <u>whose</u> father is being talked about. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>our(incl) father</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his father</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Lord:</strong> This is translated from the Greek word <em>kurios</em>, which means “master,” “chief,” or “leader.” It is a title that indicates respect and has a positive meaning. In the New Testament, the Greek word <em>kurios</em> nearly always refers to Christ. Occasionally it refers to God or a human being. In some languages, you can not say “<u>the</u> Lord” or “<u>the</u> master,” and so it may be necessary to say “our Lord” or “my Lord.” See the note on “Father” immediately before this one. If this applies to your language, you should use the possessive pronoun “our (incl).”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Jesus Christ:</strong> In this letter, as in most letters in the New Testament, <em>Christ</em> is not used as a title. Rather, it had become a proper name. It is often coupled with Jesus: Jesus Christ or Christ Jesus. You should transliterate these words, <em>Jesus Christ</em>, in this letter, as do almost all English translations. See Christ, sense 1b in KBT for further advice.</p><h4>1:1d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Grace and peace to you.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">May God act</span> graciously toward you and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">cause</span> you to be at peace.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We<sup>(excl)</sup> pray that God will</span> bless you and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">cause</span> you to be at peace.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Grace and peace to you:</strong> This is a typical greeting. Both Paul and Peter used it in their letters.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Grace:</strong> Here <em>Grace</em> refers to the way that God blesses people both materially and spiritually. See grace, sense A1 in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>peace:</strong> Here <em>peace</em> refers to people being physically, mentally, and spiritually well in all circumstances, even when they have troubles and difficult circumstances.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you:</strong> Throughout the whole letter of 1 Thessalonians the word <em>you</em> is plural.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This expression is really a prayer. The second Meaning Line in the Display shows how to express this aspect explicitly. See also the note on 5:23a.</p>",

Rather, this phrase means that as Paul prayed for them, he remembered certain things about them (1:3b–d).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>continually:</strong> The Greek word <em>adialeiptōs</em>, which the BSB translates as <em>continually</em>, actually occurs at the end of 1:2 in the Greek text. However, the commentators do not agree about which verb this word modifies. There are two possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It modifies <em>mnēmoneuō</em> “recall” in 1:3a. <em>(BSB, NIV, KJV, GW, JB, NASB, NCV, NRSV, REB, SSA)</em></p></li><li><p>It modifies the Greek phrase <em>mneian poioumenoi</em> “making mention” in 1:2. <em>(GNT, RSV, CEV, NEB, NET, NJB, NLT)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow the first option (1) because it is the most natural way to understand the Greek (see SSA, pages 22–23 for more details of why this is recommended).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>before:</strong> This word is used in a figurative way here. Paul was saying that when he prayed to God, it was as if he was in the presence of a king to request something. You should translate this carefully so your readers do not misunderstand and think that Paul was talking about going to a specific place to pray.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>our God and Father:</strong> In some languages using a possessive such as “our” with God might imply that God was in some sense possessed or owned. Clearly this phrase does not mean that here, because God cannot be owned by anyone. In other languages using a possessive might mean that Paul’s God was only one God among many. This is also not true, because Paul’s God is the only God. Here the expression <em>our God</em> means “the God whom we worship/serve.” Another method of avoiding the problem in this context is to combine the expression <em>our God</em> with <em>and Father</em> and say: “God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who is</span> our (incl) Father.”</p><h4>1:3b–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>your work of faith, your labor of love, and your enduring hope in our Lord Jesus Christ:</strong> In this part of the verse Paul listed the three aspects of the Thessalonians’ behavior that he remembered before God when he thanked God for them. The Greek here literally says: “…of you the work of the faith and labor of the love and endurance of the hope…” The following notes discuss the connection between faith and work, love and labor, hope and endurance.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your:</strong> In Greek the word <em>humōn</em> “of you (plur), your (plur)” only occurs once at the beginning of the list, but it belongs with all three phrases, as the BSB shows.</p><h4>1:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>your work of faith,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>the way you work <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for God</span> because you believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the Lord Jesus</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>your work of faith:</strong> Literally “of you the work of the faith.” Commentators suggest two meanings for this expression:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Their work was the result of their faith. This means that they worked because they believed in Jesus. <em>(GNT, NIV, NCV, SSA).</em></p></li><li><p>Their work proved they had faith. <em>(REB, JB)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow the first option (1) because it has the strongest commentary support.</p><h4>1:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>your labor of love,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and the way you work <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to help other believers</span> because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span> love <span data-bnType=\"implied\">them</span>,</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the way that you</span> love <span data-bnType=\"implied\">others</span> which makes you work hard <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to help them</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>your labor of love:</strong> Literally “of you…the labor of the love.” Most scholars think that this means that because the Thessalonians loved other believers, they worked diligently to help them. When you translate this, it may be necessary to make clear who loves and who is the one loved. One way to do this would be:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You work diligently <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to help other believers</span>, because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span> love <span data-bnType=\"implied\">them</span>.</p></blockquote><h4>1:3d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:3d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and your enduring hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and that because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you are</span> certain that our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord Jesus Christ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will come again</span> you endure <span data-bnType=\"implied\">persecution</span>.</p></li><li><p>and how <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the fact that you are</span> looking forward to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the return of</span> our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord Jesus Christ causes you to continue <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believing</span> firmly <span data-bnType=\"implied\">despite being persecuted</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and your enduring hope in our Lord Jesus Christ:</strong> Literally “of you…the endurance of the hope of our Lord Jesus Christ.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>enduring hope:</strong> Literally “endurance of hope.” Biblical scholars understand this expression in one of two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means that the Thessalonians endured persecution <u>because</u> they believed strongly in the Lord Jesus. In other words, what they believed caused them to endure. <em>(NIV, NCV, SSA)</em></p></li><li><p>It means that their hope was steadfast, that it endured. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>how your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ is firm (GNT) <em>(BSB, GNT, GW, CEV, NJB).</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow the first interpretation (1). 1 Thessalonians 1:6, 2:14, 3:4, and 3:8 support this. In these verses Paul spoke favorably about how the Christians had endured firmly while people were persecuting them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>hope in our Lord Jesus Christ:</strong> In this context, the event that the Thessalonians were hoping for was the time when the Lord Jesus would return. See 1 Thessalonians 4:13–18.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>hope:</strong> In English a person can “hope” that something will happen without being sure in any way that it will happen. However, in the biblical sense it means “being certain that something will happen.” It is almost equivalent to “strongly believing that something will happen.”</p>",

He knew this because he saw how they had responded when he and his companions preached the gospel to them. The Thessalonians not only observed that Paul and his companions believed what they preached. They also saw that the Holy Spirit confirmed that what they said was true. The result was that some of the Thessalonians believed in Jesus, even though fellow citizens persecuted them. Other believers in the regions of Macedonia and Achaia heard about how the Thessalonians had believed the gospel. Therefore, the Thessalonians had become an example to many people in different places. The result was that wherever Paul and his companions went to preach, the people there had already heard how the Thessalonians had become believers in Christ.</p></div><h4>1:4</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:4\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Brothers who are beloved by God, we know that He has chosen you,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Brothers whom God loves, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we<sup>(excl)</sup> thank God also</span> because we<sup>(excl)</sup> know that he has chosen you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be his own people</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Brothers who are beloved by God:</strong> This is an example of a vocative phrase, that is, a term of direct address to someone. In some languages, vocative phrases come at the beginning of a sentence; in other languages, they can occur elsewhere in the sentence. You should put this in the natural position in the sentence for your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Brothers:</strong> This term was frequently used in the New Testament to refer to fellow Christians. It shows that Christians are like brothers and sisters in God’s family. It is better to use a general term that includes both elder and younger siblings, male and female, if you can, rather than a more specific term. In some languages, as is the case with the word “father” (see the note on “God the Father” in 1:1c), when the word “brother” is used, it is necessary to specify <u>whose</u> brother is being talked about. If this is true in your language, you should use “our (excl).”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we know:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>we know</em> is more literally “knowing.” It connects back to 1:2. The connection between 1:2 and 1:4 is: “we thank God…because we know…” See the Display on 1:4. The fact that God had chosen the Thessalonians to become his people was yet another reason why Paul thanked God for them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that He has chosen you:</strong> God chooses people for many different purposes. Passages in the New Testament tend to focus on one of these purposes rather than including them all. Some of the purposes are:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>God chooses to save people,</p></li><li><p>he chooses them to be his own people,</p></li><li><p>he chooses them to receive eternal life,</p></li><li><p>he chooses them to be believers,</p></li><li><p>he chooses them to serve him,</p></li><li><p>he chooses them to be like Christ.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul did not make it clear which of these he meant in this passage. Different commentators suggest all the examples above as possibilities. The option that God has chosen the Thessalonians to be his people seems to include the other options and matches the Old Testament idea of God choosing the Israelites to be his special people. So it is recommended that you follow this if you need to make this clear in your translation.</p>",

The singular form of <em>word</em> refers to words in general.</p><h4>1:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but also in power, in the Holy Spirit,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but it was also the Holy Spirit working powerfully <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in us<sup>(excl)</sup></span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but also in power:</strong> Scholars do not agree about whether this means:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>That Paul and his companions preached powerfully,</p></li><li><p>That the message had a powerful effect on the Thessalonians.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Although both of these options are undoubtedly true, the context of this verse suggests that the focus is on Paul’s preaching, not the response of the Thessalonians. So it is recommended that you follow the first option (1).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the Holy Spirit:</strong> Scholars do not agree about how this phrase connects to the other phrases in this verse. There are four possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It connects to the phrase “with power” above. This means that Paul and his companions preached powerfully because the Holy Spirit was working in them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in the power of the Holy Spirit (REB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>It connects with the phrase “and with great conviction” in 1:5d. This means that it was the Holy Spirit who produced the great conviction.</p></li><li><p>It connects with both “with power” and “with great conviction.”</p></li><li><p>The phrase is simply the second item in a list of three ways that the gospel came to the Thessalonians: it came (a) with power, (b) with the Holy Spirit, and (c) with deep conviction.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions are ambiguous. However, the majority of commentators support the first option (1). If you need to select one option in your translation, it is recommended that you also follow this option.Words alone would not have been enough to persuade the Thessalonians to believe in God and the Lord Jesus Christ. It required the Holy Spirit’s power to persuade them.</p><h4>1:5d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:5d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and with great conviction—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you realised that we<sup>(excl)</sup></span> strongly believed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the words that we<sup>(excl)</sup> spoke were true</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and with great conviction:</strong> The Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>great conviction</em> can also be translated “full assurance” or “complete certainty.” Biblical scholars do not agree to whom <em>great conviction</em> applied. There are two possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It applied to Paul and his companions, who were fully convinced that their message was true. <em>(GNT, CEV, NCV, REB)</em></p></li><li><p>It applied to the Thessalonians, who were convinced that the message was true. <em>(NJB, NLT)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It makes most sense to interpret this phrase in the same way as 1:5c. Not only did Paul and his companions preach powerfully because the Holy Spirit enabled them to do that, but also they were fully convinced that what they said was true. Therefore, it is recommended that you follow the first option (1).</p><h4>1:5e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:5e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>just as you know we lived among you for your sake.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You know this</span> since you know well how we<sup>(excl)</sup> behaved among you for your benefit.</p></li><li><p>You know that, when we<sup>(excl)</sup> were living among you, we<sup>(excl)</sup> behaved in such a way as to help you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>just as you know we lived among you:</strong> In the Greek text 1:2–5 is one long sentence. This clause (1:5e) in the Greek begins with <em>kathōs</em>, which the BSB has translated as <em>just as</em>. The Thessalonians had seen how Paul and his companions had behaved while they were in Thessalonica. Therefore, they knew that what Paul had just said in 1:5a–d was true. See 1 Thessalonians 2:1–12 for details about Paul’s time in Thessalonica.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for your sake:</strong> That is, “for your benefit.” Paul did not specify what “benefit” he meant here. So it is recommended that you use as general an expression as you can to translate this part of the verse. Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in order to help you (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and how we helped you (CEV)</p></blockquote>",

Therefore, Paul and his companions did not need to say anything (1:8d).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>what kind of welcome you gave us:</strong> The Greek word <em>eisodos</em>, which the BSB translates as <em>welcome</em>, literally means “entrance.” The commentators do not agree how this word should be understood here. There are two possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It should be understood literally. This focuses on Paul and his companions and what they did in Thessalonica. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>our visit to you (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>how we started the work among you” (NJB) <em>(REB, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It should be understood figuratively. It means “welcome.” This focuses on the way that the Thessalonians welcomed Paul and his companions and accepted their message. <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, RSV, CEV, GW, NCV, NLT)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Although most English versions prefer the second option, it is recommended that you follow the first option (1). Most commentators support this option. The whole passage focuses on the successful nature of Paul’s ministry. This makes the first option more likely. In addition, 2:1 uses the same Greek word with this meaning.</p><h4>1:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They tell <span data-bnType=\"implied\">everyone</span> how you stopped worshipping your gods <span data-bnType=\"implied\">which are not alive</span> and you began to worship the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">only</span> real God who is alive.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and how you turned to God from idols:</strong> This refers to how the Thessalonians stopped worshiping their traditional gods and idols and began worshiping God. At this time in history, the expression “to turn to God from idols” usually described people who had stopped worshiping idols and had become <u>Jews</u>. But here Paul was referring to people that had become <u>Christians</u> not Jews. The words in 1:10 make this clear. So it seems that Paul was saying that the majority of the Thessalonian Christians had changed directly from their traditional religion to Christianity. They did not first convert to the Jewish religion, as some of those in Acts 17:4 did.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>idols:</strong> When Paul talked about <em>idols</em>, he was referring both to the spirit and the object or image that represents it. Therefore, you can translate <em>idols</em> by the word or phrase that your language uses to refer to traditional fetishes, gods, or spirits. However, if possible, use a general word that refers to any idol, not the name of a specific one.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to serve:</strong> The Greek word <em>douleuō</em> used here means “to serve a master.” However, Paul did not mean working <u>for</u> God. He meant becoming wholeheartedly committed to God, acknowledging him as Lord and worshiping him.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the living and true God:</strong> The expression <em>the living…God</em> is frequently found in the Old Testament, for example, Psalm 42:2. It means “the only God who is alive.” The expression “the true God…the living God” is found in Jeremiah 10:10. It emphasizes that there is only one God, a living one, and all other so-called gods are false. Paul used that meaning here. Paul was praising the Thessalonians because they had stopped worshiping their dead, false idols and now worshiped the God who is alive and is the only real God.</p>",

He knew this because he saw how they had responded when he and his companions preached the gospel to them. The Thessalonians not only observed that Paul and his companions believed what they preached. They also saw that the Holy Spirit confirmed that what they said was true. The result was that some of the Thessalonians believed in Jesus, even though fellow citizens persecuted them. Other believers in the regions of Macedonia and Achaia heard about how the Thessalonians had believed the gospel. Therefore, the Thessalonians had become an example to many people in different places. The result was that wherever Paul and his companions went to preach, the people there had already heard how the Thessalonians had become believers in Christ.</p></div><h4>1:10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and to await His Son from heaven,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they tell everyone</span> how you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">now</span> look forward to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the time when</span> God’s Son <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will come</span> from heaven,</p></li><li><p>And <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they tell everyone</span> how you are waiting <span data-bnType=\"implied\">expectantly</span> for God’s Son <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to return to earth</span> from heaven.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and to await His Son from heaven:</strong> This refers to the time when Jesus will return to earth. This is a theme in Paul’s letters to the Thessalonians. See 1 Thessalonians 3:13, 4:13–18, 5:1–3, and 2 Thessalonians 2:1–12 for further explanation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to await:</strong> In this context this expression implies “expecting with certainty that Jesus will return.” Here is another way to translate this expression:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to wait expectantly (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His Son:</strong> The phrase <em>His Son</em> refers to God’s Son, Jesus. “The Son of God” or “God’s Son” is a title that was often used to refer to a savior who would be a descendant of King David. God would send this savior to rescue his people. This person was often referred to as the “Messiah” or “Christ.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The title “the Son of God” also indicates that Jesus has the same nature and character as God. The relationship between God the Father and Jesus, his Son, is similar in some way to the relationship between human fathers and sons. But God the Father does not have a physical body. He did not have a sexual relationship with Mary that resulted in her becoming pregnant and giving birth to Jesus. The Son of God existed eternally as the Son with his Father.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In areas where people do not understand the title “the Son of God” in this way, you may want to include a footnote that explains the correct meaning. Here is a suggested footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The title “his Son” or “the Son of God” refers to Jesus. It indicates that Jesus has the same nature and character as God. It does not mean that God the Father had a sexual relationship with Mary that resulted in her becoming pregnant and giving birth to Jesus. Mary became pregnant with Jesus in a miraculous way by the Holy Spirit of God.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is natural to speak of a son as a “child,” without specifying male or female. If that is true in your language, you may use a more general term, such as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his Child<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A translation of the title “the Son of God” must include a familial term such as “son” or “child.” Translations such as “the man who is God,” “the divine man,” or “the God man” are not acceptable, since they do not retain familial language. Examples of acceptable translation options include “the Son who comes from God” and “the divine/unique/eternal Son of God.”</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Other verses will usually make clear that Jesus was a male child. If you use a phrase such as “his male child,” be sure that it does not imply that God had another child who was female.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>heaven:</strong> The word <em>heaven</em> refers to the place where God lives. Many languages use the same term for “sky” and for <em>heaven</em>.</p><h4>1:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>whom He raised from the dead—Jesus</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It is this same</span> Jesus whom God raised from death,</p></li></ul></div><h4>1:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>our deliverer from the coming wrath.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and he delivers us<sup>(incl)</sup> from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> anger that will punish <span data-bnType=\"implied\">those who sin</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">and it is he</span> who keeps us<sup>(incl)</sup> safe so that God will not punish us<sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when he punishes those who have not believed in his Son</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>our deliverer:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>deliverer</em> is a present participle in Greek and therefore includes both the present and the future. Jesus is delivering his people now and he will deliver them in the future so that God will not punish them on the day when he judges all people.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>from the coming wrath:</strong> This refers to <u>God’s</u> anger. Because God is holy, he is angry when people sin. Paul referred to this anger as <em>coming</em> because he was referring to the day when God will judge everyone. On that day God will show this anger and he will punish people who have sinned but have never repented and trusted in Jesus.</p>",

The word <em>You</em> contrasts with “they themselves” in 1:9a. Not only were other people talking about Paul’s visit to Thessalonica, but the Thessalonians themselves knew what had happened.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>brothers:</strong> See the note on 1:4.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>our visit to you:</strong> The Greek word <em>eisodos</em>, which the BSB translates as <em>visit</em> here, is the same word that it translated as “welcome” in 1:9a. It is most logical to translate the word the same way in both places. Nearly all commentators and English versions agree that here it means <em>visit</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>was not in vain:</strong> Rather than simply saying “our visit to you was a success,” Paul chose to make his statement stronger by using two negatives: <em>not</em> and <em>in vain</em>. This sort of figure of speech is called “litotes.” Paul wanted to emphasize that his visit had definitely had a good result. When he had preached the gospel, it had resulted in the Thessalonians believing in Jesus Christ. Paul was referring to 1:9, which says that many Thessalonians had stopped worshiping idols and had begun to serve God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you do not use litotes in your language to strengthen a statement, you may need to restate this part of the verse positively. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You know, brothers, that our visit to you was a great success.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You know, brothers, that when we visited you, there were great results.</p></blockquote>",

Versions such as the ESV, NASB, and NET place it there. This makes it clear that what Paul was about to say in 2:2 connects to 2:1. Paul was saying that his visit had not been a failure but, <u>on the contrary</u>, it had been a success because, despite persecution, he had still preached in Thessalonica. However, other versions, including the BSB and the CEV, NIV, and NLT, place this conjunction before 2:2b-c. This indicates the contrast between Paul&apos;s boldness and the persecution that could have made him afraid. Place this conjunction where it would be natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">If you translated 2:1 using litotes, you could use an expression such as “on the contrary” here. If, however, you used a positive statement, you will need to use a word such as “indeed” to link the two verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>As you are aware, we had already endured suffering and shameful treatment in Philippi:</strong> See Acts 16:16–40 for details of Paul’s suffering at Philippi.</p><h4>2:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But in the face of strong opposition,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>yet <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in spite of that</span>, even though many <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> opposed us,<sup>(excl)</sup></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the face of strong opposition:</strong> The Greek is literally “in much struggle.” Most commentators and versions agree that Paul was referring to the people who had opposed him and tried to stop him preaching everywhere he went.</p><h4>2:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>our<sup>(incl)</sup> God helped us<sup>(excl)</sup> to have the courage <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to come/go to Thessalonica</span> and tell you the gospel that he gave us<sup>(excl)</sup>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we were bold in our God to speak to you:</strong> It was God who had enabled Paul and his companions to preach boldly in Thessalonica, even after they had been persecuted in Philippi.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>our God:</strong> In some languages, using a possessive such as “our” with God might imply that God was in some sense possessed or owned. Clearly this is not the meaning here, since God cannot be owned by anyone. In other languages it might mean that Paul’s God was only one God among many. This is also not true, because Paul’s God is the only God. The meaning is “God whom we worship/serve.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the gospel of God:</strong> God is the source of the good news concerning Jesus Christ. So you could translate the phrase <em>the gospel of God</em> as “the good news that God gave” or “the good news that came from God.”</p>",

He affirmed that what he and his companions had preached was true and that they wanted to please God rather than people. Paul and his companions had never asked anyone to honor them personally, although they could have done that because they were apostles. In the Greek world there were many people who traveled from place to place teaching people and living at the expense of those who began to follow them. Paul wanted to emphasize how different he and his companions were from people like that. This is probably the reason why he defended himself here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">To prove this, Paul reminded the Thessalonians believers how he and his companions had worked to earn their own money so they would not burden them. He also reminded them that he and his companions behaved toward them the way a good father behaves toward his children. He then urged them to behave in a way that would please God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:3–4 Paul was describing his ministry among people in general, wherever he and his companions went and preached. Then in 2:5 he talks about his specific ministry among the Thessalonians.</p></div><h4>2:3a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:3a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For our appeal</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">The reason that our<sup>(excl)</sup> message to you succeeded</span> was that when we<sup>(excl)</sup> urge <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people to believe the gospel</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> Paul and his companions had succeeded in producing the result that they had hoped to produce by preaching to the Thessalonians. That result was that Thessalonians had believed in Jesus. Here Paul gave another reason why their preaching was successful (2:1) and why they could preach the gospel boldly (2:2c).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>our appeal:</strong> It is not clear from the Greek text or from most English versions to whom Paul made this <em>appeal</em>. There are two possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>He appealed to people in general. <em>(NET, SSA)</em></p></li><li><p>He appealed to the Thessalonians in particular. <em>(GNT, CEV, GW, NJB)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">If possible you should leave your translation ambiguous here. However, if you must say to whom Paul appealed, it is recommended that you follow the first option and use a word for people in general. This option has the support of most commentators.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>appeal:</strong> Paul’s appeal was to urge people to believe the gospel.</p><h4>2:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>does not arise from deceit or ulterior motives</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">what we<sup>(excl)</sup> say</span> is not based on incorrect thinking, nor do we<sup>(excl)</sup> intend to do what is morally wrong,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>does not arise from:</strong> There is no verb in the Greek text in this part of the verse, yet all English translations need to supply one. Most English versions supply a verb such as “spring from,” “come from,” or “is based on.” You should choose a verb that makes it clear that Paul was saying that his appeal <u>did not originate from</u> error.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">All English versions except the KJV supply a verb in the present tense to indicate that Paul was talking about something he did habitually. It is recommended that you use a verb tense or aspect that refers to habitual actions, that is, actions that occur frequently. This matches the tense of the verb “speak” in 2:4a, which also shows habitual action.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>deceit:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>deceit</em> is more literally “error” or “delusion.” This Greek word can have two meanings:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Paul meant that he was not mistaken or deluded or mad. <em>(NIV, NJB, REB)</em></p></li><li><p>Paul meant that he was not deliberately deceiving them. <em>(BSB, GW, KJV, NCV, NLT, NRSV)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions are ambiguous. Probably the first opinion (1) is correct here. Otherwise the meaning would be almost the same as 2:3c and Paul would just have been repeating himself.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>ulterior motives:</strong> The Greek word <em>akatharsia</em>, which the BSB translates as <em>ulterior motives</em>, literally means “uncleanness.” This could mean one of two things:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means any kind of moral impurity, for example, greed, ambition, vanity, pride, or sexual immorality. Preaching to gain money, as some people were doing, is one example of an “impure motive” in this context. <em>(GW, NCV)</em></p></li><li><p>It specifically means sexual immorality. <em>(JB)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions are ambiguous. It is recommended that you follow the first meaning (1) here. Choose a general term, because most commentators agree that in this context the meaning should not be limited to sexual immorality.</p><h4>2:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>or trickery.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and we<sup>(excl)</sup> are not trying to deceive <span data-bnType=\"implied\">anyone</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>or trickery:</strong> Literally, “nor trickery.” Paul was speaking generally here, so it is most likely that Paul was saying that he and his companions were not intending to deceive <u>anyone</u> at any time. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we didn&apos;t try to fool or trick anyone (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>nor do we try to trick anyone (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">He said more about this in 2:5a and 2:5b when he talked about “flattery” and “any pretext for greed.” See the notes on those verses.</p>",

Paul used this repetition to emphasize his statement. If you do not have two similar words that you can use here, or if it would be unnatural for you to use such repetition, you could translate this as “we worked very diligently/hard.”</p><h4>2:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>We worked night and day</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Indeed,</span> we<sup>(excl)</sup> worked night and day <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to get money to support ourselves<sup>(excl)</sup></span></p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">In fact,</span> we<sup>(excl)</sup> worked <span data-bnType=\"implied\">not only</span> during the day <span data-bnType=\"implied\">but also</span> at night <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to earn money to pay our<sup>(excl)</sup> own expenses</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>We worked night and day:</strong> Acts 18:3–5 records that Paul’s job was to make tents to sell.

Some English versions, such as the RSV, NASB, and GW, similarly include 2:12a in 2:11. You should follow the English or national language version that is most common in your area.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>encouraging you, comforting you:</strong> The two Greek verbs here, <em>parakaleō</em> and <em>paramutheomai</em>, have similar meanings. They both include the meanings “to encourage, exhort, comfort.” If you have two similar words you can use here, you should do so. Otherwise, you can use a single term.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and urging you:</strong> The Greek word <em>marturomai</em>, which the BSB translates as <em>urging</em>, has a different meaning from the other two verbs in this part of the verse. It means “telling someone how necessary or important it is to do a particular thing.” Here is another way to translate this in English:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>insist (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The form of all three of these verbs in Greek (they are present participles) mean that these were actions that happened continually. Paul and his companions continued encouraging, comforting, and urging the Thessalonians.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to walk in a manner worthy of God:</strong> This means “to behave in such a way that God would be pleased that you are members of his kingdom.” Paul uses the verb <em>walk</em> to describe how people behave. See also 4:1a, where the BSB translates this word as “live.”</p><h4>2:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who calls you into His own kingdom and glory.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the one</span> who invites you to become part of his kingdom and share in his greatness.</p></li><li><p>who summons you to belong to the people over whom he rules and to share in his greatness.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who calls you into His own kingdom and glory:</strong> In Greek there is a textual problem with this part of the verse. The KJV has followed the manuscripts that have a past tense verb here: “who <u>hath</u> called.” However, the best manuscripts have a present participle that the BSB translates with a continuous present tense <em>who calls</em>. It is strongly recommended that you follow these manuscripts. All other English versions also use a present tense here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This form of the verb literally means “the one calling, the caller.” Paul used this verb form to focus on one of two things:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It focuses on the <u>fact</u> that God is the one who calls people into his kingdom. The verb then does not have any particular time/tense. God calls new people every day.</p></li><li><p>It focuses on God continuously calling the Thessalonians. He called them originally when they became Christians but went on calling them every day to new aspects of their Christian life.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is not possible to know which of these aspects Paul was concentrating on here. In your translation you have two options:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a continuous present tense, as most English versions have done: “who calls you.”</p></li><li><p>In some languages it may be possible to use a nominal form: “the caller of you.”</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>calls you into:</strong> In some languages it may not be possible to say “call into something.” The UBS handbook suggests a verb such as “invite,” and the SSA suggests “summon.” It may also be necessary to include an additional verb here. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who calls you to <u>share in</u> (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His own kingdom and glory:</strong> There are two ways to understand this:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>God called the Thessalonians to share in two things: <em>His own kingdom</em> and <em>His own…glory</em>. <em>(BSB, NIV, RSV, NET, GNT, GW, KJV, REB, CEV)</em></p></li><li><p>This could be interpreted as a hendiadys. This means that the second noun, <em>glory</em>, modifies the first noun, <em>kingdom</em>. This would then be translated “his glorious kingdom”. <em>(NCV, SSA)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Although the structure of this part of the verse in Greek gives some support to the second option, many commentators prefer the first option. This means that God’s kingdom and his glory are two related, yet separate, things that the Thessalonians could expect to share in if they behaved in a way that was worthy of God (2:12a). It therefore is recommended that you follow the first option (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The expectation of sharing in God’s kingdom and glory would also be an encouragement to continue believing despite persecution. Compare with Paul’s words in Romans 8:18.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>kingdom:</strong> In this context, this does not refer to a geographical region, but to God’s rule over his people. To share in God’s kingdom then means “to be the people over whom God will rule.” See kingdom in the glossary. See also “Kingdom of God&quot;, sense 1 in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>glory:</strong> In this context, to share God’s glory means to share his greatness/majesty. See “glory&quot;, sense 3b in KBT and in the glossary.</p>",

Paul was saying that, because the Thessalonians had become imitators of the congregations in Judea, this showed that <u>they had accepted Paul’s message</u>.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Commentators are equally divided and English versions are ambiguous, either using “for” or no explicit link. The Display follows the first option.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>brothers:</strong> See the note on 1:4.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you…became imitators:</strong> The meaning here is slightly different from that in 1:6a, where the same verb is used. Paul was not saying that the Thessalonians had deliberately imitated the Judean Christians. Instead, in this section Paul wanted to say that the Thessalonians did not intentionally imitate the Judean churches. The Thessalonians had not asked people to persecute them. They had simply obeyed the message that Paul had preached. The result was that people had persecuted them just as the Jews had persecuted the Christians in the Judea. If you use the same expression here as you used in 1:6a, it would give the impression that the Thessalonians had deliberately copied the Judean believers. Therefore, you should use a different expression here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your experiences have been like those of God’s churches in Christ that are in Judea (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to express it is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the same things have happened to you as happened to God’s churches in Christ that are in Judea.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the churches of God:</strong> Paul was speaking about groups of people who believe in Christ Jesus. As in 1:1b, you should avoid a translation of the word “church” that would make people think of a building.

The Jews <em>who killed …their own prophets</em> refers to people who killed some of the Old Testament prophets from many generations ago. This refers to different people than those who plotted to kill Jesus, which happened only 20 years or so before Paul wrote this letter. In both cases, although the Jews are referred to as a whole, it was only certain people, or certain groups of people who wanted to have them killed.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>who killed both the Lord Jesus:</strong> Although it was Roman soldiers who actually crucified Jesus, it was the Jewish leaders who handed Jesus over to the Romans and who were therefore responsible for his death. Notice that this group of Jews was not the same group of Jews who had persecuted the Judean churches (2:14b).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>their own prophets:</strong> Paul was referring to the Old Testament prophets here. A literal translation of Paul’s words in some languages may imply that the Jews had killed <u>all</u> the prophets, so you may need to make it clear that it was only <u>some</u> prophets who were killed. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who killed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">some of</span> their own prophets</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This is not referring to a specific event where many prophets were killed. It is referring broadly to the many generations during the Old Testament period where prophets were killed.

The commentators disagree about what it means in this verse. There are two possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Paul used it with its literal meaning “to drive out.” This is what the Jews did to Paul in Thessalonica and Berea (Acts 17:5–10, 13–15). <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, REB, CEV, NCV)</em></p></li><li><p>Paul used the word with the secondary meaning “to persecute.” The way that Paul and his companions were being “driven out” is just one example of how they were “being persecuted.” <em>(KJV, GNT, GW, NET, NJB)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">In the context, the first option (1) makes the most sense and is therefore recommended.

This means that they had tried hard to stop Paul. That <u>resulted in</u> them adding to their previous sins of killing the prophets and Jesus, which they had done thinking (mistakenly) that they were pleasing God. <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, NET, GW, NJB, NRSV, NCV, NLT)</em></p></li><li><p>It indicates the <u>purpose</u> of their actions.

Paul was comparing the way that they sinned more and more to someone adding to a pile of rubbish. This illustrated how God had been patient from even Old Testament times. He had figuratively allowed the pile of sins to grow high. But finally, Paul said, God had become very angry and would soon punish them.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The wrath of God (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>utmost:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>utmost</em> is more literally “in/to the end.” This phrase can have several meanings. There are two primary possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The phrase goes with “has come upon them” and indicates that these people are experiencing wrath “finally” or “in the end.” <em>(RSV, ESV, NIV, CEV, NCV, GNT, GW, NJB)</em></p></li><li><p>The phrase goes with “wrath” and indicates that this “wrath” is extreme or complete. <em>(BSB, KJV, REB, NET)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow the first option (1), along with the majority of English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>has come upon them:</strong> Commentators do not agree about the timing of this. The tense of the verb in Greek would seem to indicate that the judgment had already taken place before Paul wrote the letter. However, Paul may have used the past tense here to show that this was something certain to happen.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Many English versions simply follow the Greek past tense, though the JB and GW use a present tense verb.

This conjunction does not introduce a contrast with the previous verse. Instead, it indicates that Paul was changing from the topic of what the Jews did to him and his companions to a new topic. The new topic was how he and his companions felt when they had to leave Thessalonica. Some English versions, including the BSB, do not translate this conjunction. Introduce this verse in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Brothers:</strong> See the note on 1:4.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>although we were torn away from you:</strong> See Acts 17:1–10. Local Jews had persecuted Paul and his companions and forced them to leave Thessalonica hurriedly. The passive form of the Greek verb <em>aporphanizō</em> is used here. While the BSB translates it as <em>torn away</em>, it literally means “to be orphaned,” that is, to lose both parents by them dying. However, in this context this word is used figuratively and means “to be separated from.” Paul probably used the term to express how sad he felt because he had to leave Thessalonica suddenly and be separated from the Thessalonians.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for a short time:</strong> A short time after Paul left Thessalonica, he began to desire to see the Thessalonians again.

If not, one way to translate the verse is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we ourselves were not with you, but we were always thinking about you (UBS Handbook, page 48)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This part of the verse is a parenthesis that further describes the verb “torn away” in 2:17a.</p><h4>2:17c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:17c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>our desire to see you face to face was even more intense.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>since we<sup>(excl)</sup> desired greatly to be with you again, we<sup>(excl)</sup> tried very hard to return to you.</p></li><li><p>we<sup>(excl)</sup> very much wanted to see you again, so we<sup>(excl)</sup> tried very earnestly to do that.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>our desire to see you face to face was even more intense:</strong> The Greek verb <em>spoudazō</em>, which the BSB translates as <em>was…more intense</em>, can mean one of two things:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“to make a great effort, to try very strongly”. <em>(NIV, RSV, GNT, CEV, KJV, NCV, NLT).</em></p></li><li><p>“to be very eager, to want very much”. <em>(BSB, NET, NJB, NRSV, REB, SSA)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow the first option (1), as it fits the immediate context of 2:18, where Paul explained further how hard he had tried to see the Thessalonians again.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>face to face:</strong> Here Paul uses the same idiom he used in 2:17b.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you will give us hope (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It is difficult to know how much of the meaning of this expression a translator should make explicit in the translation. The Display shows some ways of translating this part of the verse.

When Jesus returned, they would also cause Paul and his companions to rejoice, because they had continued to believe firmly in Jesus Christ.</p><h4>2:19c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:19c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>our crown of boasting,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>you are the reason why we<sup>(excl)</sup> will be proud.</p></li><li><p>and you cause us<sup>(excl)</sup> to be proud of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">our work</span>.</p></li><li><p>and you are <span data-bnType=\"implied\">something</span> we<sup>(excl)</sup> can be proud of, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like an athlete can be proud of</span> the wreath <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he has won</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>our crown:</strong> In Greek culture, one of the symbols of great honor was a wreath of laurel leaves that was placed on the head of an athlete who had won a race. Paul was using this image in a metaphor here. He described the Thessalonians as his “wreath of honor.” This means that, just as the laurel wreath showed that an athlete had won a race, so the fact that the Thessalonians strongly believed in Jesus would show that Paul’s work in preaching the gospel had been successful.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>of boasting:</strong> The Greek word for <em>boasting</em> here is not the same word as is usually translated “glory” in the New Testament. It is a word that means “reason for boasting, pride.” The word “boasting” in English often has a negative meaning, and a better translation is “of which we will be proud.” Here Paul means that he, Silvanus, and Timothy will be proud of the “crown.” See glory in the glossary, meaning 2.</p><h4>2:19d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:19d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>if it is not you yourselves</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yes,</span> it is you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who will be our<sup>(excl)</sup> hope, joy and crown</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if it is not you yourselves:</strong> Here Paul emphasizes the fact that the Thessalonians would indeed be his “hope,” “joy,” and “crown.” You could include Paul’s emphasis by beginning the verse part with something like, “It is <u>indeed</u> you….”</p><h4>2:19e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:19e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His coming?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>before our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord Jesus <span data-bnType=\"implied\">on the day</span> when he returns.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His coming:</strong> This phrase is connected with 2:19a–d, not just 2:19d. There is no verb in the first part of the verse (2:19a–d), so all translators need to decide what tense of verb to use. Many English versions use the present tense in order to be consistent with 2:20. However, 2:19e makes it clear that here Paul was talking about the future. So in some languages, it will be better to use a future tense. You should use whichever tense of verb makes most sense in your language in this context.</p>",

The purpose of Timothy’s visit was to strengthen and encourage the Thessalonians to continue believing in Christ even when people persecuted them. As Christians, they should expect that other people would cause them to suffer. Paul was very concerned about them, because he feared that the Thessalonians had been persecuted so severely that the devil had been able to tempt them to stop following Christ.</p></div><h4>3:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So when we could bear it no longer,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ So, when we<sup>(excl)</sup> could no longer bear <span data-bnType=\"implied\">not being able to see you again</span>,</p></li><li><p>¶ Therefore, when we<sup>(excl)</sup> could not tolerate <span data-bnType=\"implied\">being separated from you</span> any longer,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So:</strong> This Greek conjunction, <em>dio</em>, indicates that this paragraph, 3:1–5, is the result of 2:17–20. That is, the <u>result</u> of Paul making every effort to return to the Thessalonians was that, when he discovered that he could not go to Thessalonica, he sent Timothy instead to find out how the Thessalonians were. Here is another way to translate this transition:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>therefore</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>when we could bear it no longer:</strong> In Greek, the verb that the BSB translates as <em>we could bear it</em> is a participle.

For example: “when we could no longer bear <span data-bnType=\"implied\">not knowing how you were doing</span>.”</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>we:</strong> This is an exclusive pronoun, since it refers to Paul and his companions, but not to the Thessalonian believers.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>bear:</strong> The verb <em>bear</em> means to “carry the weight of, endure&quot;. Paul and his companions could not tolerate waiting longer to know how the Thessalonians were doing spiritually.</p><h4>3:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>we were willing to be left on our own in Athens.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>we<sup>(excl)(dual)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">willingly</span> decided to remain by ourselves<sup>(excl)(dual)</sup> in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the city of</span> Athens.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we were willing:</strong> This translates the same Greek word that was translated “we were delighted to” in 2:8b. In this context it means “we decided, it seemed good to us.” This refers to Paul and Silvanus (Silas) since they were the ones who were left in Athens. If your language has a dual form, you may wish to use it here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we<sup>(dual)</sup> were willing</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to be left on our own in Athens:</strong> Timothy and Silas had joined Paul sometime after he got to Athens (Acts 17:15–16). It was sometime later that Paul sent Timothy back to Thessalonica. We do not know exact times for these events.</p>",

In some languages, wording it this way may interrupt the flow of the sentence to have this information about Timothy between Paul’s statement that “we sent” him and his description of the reason why he and Silvanus sent him. Paul provided this information in order to confirm that he had authorized Timothy to visit the Thessalonians and that Timothy was fully qualified to help them. In some languages it may be necessary to use a separate sentence for Paul’s description of Timothy, then return to the main theme in a new sentence afterward. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and send Timothy to you. Timothy, our brother, works with us for God and helps us tell people the Good news about Christ. We sent him to strengthen and encourage you in your faith. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>our brother:</strong> For the term <em>brother</em>, see the note on 1:4.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>fellow worker for God:</strong> There is a textual problem in this verse.

There are two possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means that Timothy worked <u>together with</u> God, that they worked together to spread the gospel. <em>(ESV, REB, NIV)</em></p></li><li><p>It means that Timothy was a fellow-worker of Paul and Silas and that all three worked together <u>for</u> God. <em>(BSB, NIV11, GNT, NCV, NET, NLT, NRSV, SSA)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow the first option (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in the gospel of Christ:</strong> The Greek text has no verb in this part of the verse, but most modern English versions include a verb here, such as “spreading” (NIV) or “preaching” (GNT).

Make sure the word you choose to translate this verb does not give the impression that God is a dictator who, without good reason, likes to make people suffer.

That is, the Thessalonians knew they were destined to be persecuted <u>because</u> Paul and his companions had told them so.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we kept warning you:</strong> The Greek verb <em>prolegō</em>, which the BSB translates as <em>warning</em>, means “to foretell, to tell something before it happens.” The BSB has left implicit the idea of “before it happens,” as this is clear from the context.

The purpose of Timothy’s visit was to strengthen and encourage the Thessalonians to continue believing in Christ even when people persecuted them. As Christians, they should expect that other people would cause them to suffer. Paul was very concerned about them, because he feared that the Thessalonians had been persecuted so severely that the devil had been able to tempt them to stop following Christ.</p></div><h4>3:5a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:5a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For this reason, when I could bear it no longer,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>That is why, when I could no longer bear <span data-bnType=\"implied\">not knowing whether or not you still believed in Christ</span>,</p></li><li><p>Because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I knew that you were being persecuted and</span> when I could not tolerate/bear any longer <span data-bnType=\"implied\">not knowing how you were doing</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For this reason:</strong> Commentators do not agree about what this refers to. There are two possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers back to 3:4. Paul was saying that, because he knew that the Thessalonians were being persecuted, he was anxious about them. <em>(GNT, NLT, REB, NJB, SSA)</em></p></li><li><p>It refers forward to the rest of 3:5. Paul was saying that, because he could no longer stand not knowing how the Thessalonians were, he had sent Timothy. In this case, this verse repeats 3:1a, which contains a similar phrase in Greek.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Many English versions are ambiguous, and it may be possible for you to translate this in a way that leaves both possibilities open. However, if that is not possible, it is recommended that you follow the first option (1), along with the majority of English versions that are not ambiguous.</p><h4>3:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I sent to find out about your faith,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I sent <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Timothy</span> to find out whether or not you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">still firmly</span> believed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I sent:</strong> The Greek text does not explicitly say whom Paul sent, but from the context it is clear that he was referring to Timothy. You may need to make this explicit in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I sent Timothy (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to find out about your faith:</strong> Paul was not spying, nor did he want to know what facts the Thessalonians believed. He wanted to know whether they still firmly believed in Jesus Christ.</p><h4>3:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for fear that the tempter had somehow tempted you</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I did this because</span> I was afraid that perhaps the one who tempts <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> might have tempted you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and might have caused you to stop believing in Christ</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for fear that:</strong> These words translate the Greek phrase <em>mē pōs</em>, which means “lest.” Paul was concerned that the Thessalonians might have stopped believing in Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the tempter:</strong> This refers to Satan, the devil. The same expression is also used in Matthew 4:3. If your readers would not understand that this term refers to Satan, you could:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>make explicit that it refers to Satan, for example, use an expression such as “Satan, the one who tempts people.”</p></li><li><p>replace the term “the tempter” with “Satan” or “the devil”. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Satan (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>devil (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>use a footnote or a note in the glossary.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>had somehow tempted you:</strong> In some languages the same word is used for “tempting” and “testing” and it is necessary to specify what someone is tempting people to do. In this context, Paul meant that he was afraid that the devil might have successfully tempted the Thessalonians to stop believing in Jesus.</p><h4>3:5d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:5d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and caused our labor to be in vain.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and that the hard work that we<sup>(excl)</sup> had done <span data-bnType=\"implied\">among you to help you believe in Christ</span> would turn out to be useless.</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because I was afraid</span> that the effort that we<sup>(excl)</sup> had made <span data-bnType=\"implied\">among you</span> had been wasted.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>our labor:</strong> This refers to the effort Paul and his companions had made as they worked and preached so that the Thessalonians would follow Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to be in vain:</strong> However, if Satan had succeeded in tempting the Thessalonians to stop following Christ, all that effort would have been worthless.</p>",

Once he knew that things were well with the Thessalonians, he was relieved, joyful, could enjoy life again, and had everything that made life worthwhile.

However, that is not true in this verse. It is just the usual opening for a prayer in Greek that asks God to do something for someone.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>direct our way to you:</strong> The Greek word <em>kateuthunō</em>, which the BSB has translated as <em>direct</em>, means “make straight, guide correctly.” Therefore, there are two ways to understand what it means here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “make straight.” So Paul was asking God to remove anything that would hinder or delay him returning to Thessalonica, just as someone would remove obstacles on a path or smooth out the surface of a road. <em>(NIV, GNT, NCV, NJB, REB)</em></p></li><li><p>It means “guide well/correctly.” So Paul was asking God to direct him and his companions safely and directly back to the Thessalonians. <em>(BSB, KJV, RSV, NET, GW)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow the first interpretation (1), as it makes good sense in the context of 2:18, where Paul wrote that Satan had hindered him from returning to Thessalonica. It would therefore be logical for Paul to ask God to remove such a hindrance.</p>",

He then urged them to do even better than they had done already.</p></div><h4>4:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Finally, brothers, we ask and encourage you in the Lord Jesus to live in a way that is pleasing to God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Furthermore, brothers, we<sup>(excl)</sup> ask you, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">indeed</span> we<sup>(excl)</sup> urge you, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as fellow believers</span> in the Lord Jesus, that you should behave in order to please God,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Finally:</strong> The Greek word <em>loipon</em>, which the BSB translates as <em>Finally</em>, indicates that here Paul was beginning the second and last major part of his letter. As in many of his other letters, in this final part he instructs the Thessalonians about how Christians should behave. However, remember there are still two chapters left, so avoid using a term which would make it sound like Paul was ending his letter here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In Greek, the verse begins with <em>oun</em>, “therefore.” Paul used this term to indicate that what he was about to write in chapters 4 and 5 was based on what he wrote in the first part of the letter, that is, chapters 1–3.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>brothers:</strong> See the note on 1:4.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we ask and encourage you:</strong> The commentators disagree about whether there is any significant difference between the meaning of the two Greek verbs <em>erōtaō</em> (<em>ask</em>) and <em>parakaleō</em> (<em>encourage</em>). Paul often used two verbs instead of one with the second one emphasizing the first. In your translation you have a choice about how to translate these two verbs:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use two verbs with similar meaning. This is what almost every English version has done.</p></li><li><p>Combine the two verbs into one expression, for example, “we strongly urge you.”</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">You should retain two verbs if it is possible to do so in your language. Otherwise, you can follow the second option.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the Lord Jesus:</strong> This is a phrase that Paul often used in his letters. However, commentators disagree about what it means. The same expression is used in 2 Thessalonians 3:12. There are two possible meanings:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “because we are united in Christ Jesus.” Paul was appealing to the common fellowship that he, his companions, and the Thessalonians had because they were all members of the family of God. <em>(REB, CEV, SSA)</em></p></li><li><p>It means “because the Lord Jesus has authorized us.” This interpretation seems to be supported by the phrase “by the authority of the Lord Jesus” in 4:2. <em>(GNT, KJV, GW, NLT)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Other English versions do not clearly indicate which of these interpretations they follow. However, it is recommended that you follow the first option (1), because in the context of this letter, Paul was emphasizing the Thessalonians’ love for him and God and Jesus, rather than his authority as an apostle.</p><h4>4:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>just as you have received from us.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>which we<sup>(excl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">already</span> taught you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when we<sup>(excl)</sup> were with you</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>just as you have received from us:</strong> Paul was referring to instructions that he and his companions had given the Thessalonian believers while they were with them. He was not referring to the instructions in the previous part of this letter. Paul and his companions had already taught them how to behave as a Christian should.</p><h4>4:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>This is how you already live,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>This is indeed the way you are behaving <span data-bnType=\"implied\">now</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>This is how you already live:</strong> This clause is omitted in KJV because some Greek manuscripts omit it. But the UBS Greek text and other major English versions agree that it should be there. Therefore, you should include it in your translation. As he did in 1:6–9, Paul was recognizing that the Thessalonians were already behaving in the way he had mentioned in 4:1a.</p><h4>4:1d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:1d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so you should do so all the more.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Even though we<sup>(excl)</sup> know that you are doing this</span>, you should <span data-bnType=\"implied\">please God</span> more and more.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so you should do so all the more:</strong> This means “you should <u>please God</u> all the more.” Paul was never content that those whom he had helped to believe in Christ should do the minimum to prove they were Christians. He wanted them all to imitate Jesus as much as possible.</p>",

All four verses, however, deal with the same topic, that is, instructions to avoid being sexually immoral.</p><h4>4:3a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:3a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For it is God’s will that you should be holy:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>What God wants is that you should behave purely/righteously,</p></li><li><p>What God wants is that you should become holy,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>For</em> shows that what Paul was about to give was a specific example of what he had instructed them while he was in Thessalonica. Many English versions have chosen to leave this conjunction implied. Introduce this verse in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that you should be holy:</strong> To <em>be holy</em> means “to be sanctified” or “to be set apart for God.” Most commentators agree that in this verse Paul was referring to “becoming sanctified/holy” rather than “being set apart for God.” See sanctify in KBT under the term “holy” and in the glossary under sanctify, meaning 2.</p><h4>4:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>You must abstain from sexual immorality;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">which means</span> that you should never commit <span data-bnType=\"implied\">any kind of</span> sexual immorality.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">which means</span> that you should never sin sexually.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You must abstain from sexual immorality:</strong> Here Paul gave one specific example of morally impure behavior.

He was using a polite way to speak about dying. The BSB has added the words <em>in death</em> to make this clear. In your translation, use the common word for dying or an appropriate polite expression.</p><h4>4:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that you will not grieve like the rest, who are without hope.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>That way, you will not mourn the way unbelievers <span data-bnType=\"implied\">mourn for other unbelievers who have died</span> because they cannot be certain <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that after they die they will become alive again</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that you will not grieve like the rest, who are without hope:</strong> Paul was not saying that the relatives of a dead person should not mourn or perform a funeral.

See the note in 1:3d on the word <em>hope</em>. In this verse it also means “being certain.” Paul did not doubt at all that Christians would live again one day after Christ returned. It may be necessary in some languages to say what the unbelievers were not certain about.

In 4:14a, Paul stated <u>the basis</u> for what he said in 4:14b. Another way to translate this connection would be:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Because</u> we believe that Jesus died and rose again, <u>then</u> certainly God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep with him.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God will bring with Jesus:</strong> Most English versions are ambiguous in the way they translate this part of the verse. The Greek verb <em>agō</em>, which the BSB translates as <em>bring</em>, is a general verb of motion and means “bring, take, lead, go.” The commentators suggest many different ways of understanding this part of the verse. The two most likely interpretations are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Paul was focusing on the fact that when Jesus returns, the bodies of Christians who have died will be resurrected. He therefore meant that God would bring these resurrected bodies from earth to be with Jesus as he returns.</p></li><li><p>Paul was focusing on the fact that after a Christian dies, his soul is with Jesus. He therefore meant here that God would bring these people from heaven back to earth with Jesus.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul did not specify which of these possibilities he was thinking of. What Paul wrote in 4:14–17 makes it clear that God will cause both the resurrected believers and the ones still living to ascend into the sky to meet Jesus as he is descending to earth. This seems to favor the first interpretation. However, Paul’s main point was that from that moment all Christians would be with Jesus, whether on earth or in heaven. So if possible, you should avoid making your translation too explicit at this point.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those who have fallen asleep:</strong> See the note on 4:13a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in Him:</strong> In Greek, the phrase that the BSB translates as <em>in Him</em> could mean either “in him” or “with him.” It is not clear from the Greek word order to which verb this phrase should be connected. There are two possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It should be attached to the verb “fallen asleep,” which comes <u>earlier in the sentence</u> it in the Greek text. The majority of commentators also support this. The meaning of the phrase “those who have fallen asleep in Him” therefore is “those who were believers when they died.” <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, NET, KJV, REB, SSA, NLT, NASB, CEV, NJB)</em></p></li><li><p>It should be attached to the verb “will bring” which <u>directly precedes</u> it in the Greek text. The meaning is therefore that it is “through Jesus” that God will cause believers to live again. <em>(RSV, GW, NCV)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow the first option (1), as do the majority of English versions and commentaries. It is the most probable grammatically.</p>",

Here Paul answered another question the Thessalonians must have asked him, about when exactly Jesus would return. As in 4:9a, the BSB has once more used the word <em>Now</em> to signal a new paragraph. Read the note on 4:9a for advice on how to translate this word.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>about the times and seasons:</strong> When the Greek words <em>chronoi</em> (<em>times</em>) and <em>kairoi</em> (<em>seasons</em>) occur together in Scripture, it is often when people are speaking about future events. For an example, see Acts 1:7. There are two possible ways to understand these words here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>There is no real difference in meaning between the two words, and the whole expression is an idiom for “the day of the Lord” (see 5:2b).</p></li><li><p>There is a difference between the two words. The word <em>chronoi</em> (<em>times</em>) refers to “duration of time.” The word <em>kairoi</em> (<em>seasons</em>) refers to “the significant events that happen before Jesus will return.” Here is one way to translate this possible sense of the expression:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>times and occasions (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is not easy to decide between these two opinions. However, in this passage Paul’s main subject was “the day of the Lord.” So it is logical to assume that here he was referring to the time when the day of the Lord would occur. It is therefore recommended that you follow the first option (1).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>brothers:</strong> See the note on 1:4.</p>",

Paul was not comparing Jesus to a thief who steals something. The point of the comparison is that Jesus will return unexpectedly, at a time when people are not prepared, in the same way that a thief comes during the night when people are asleep and not expecting him. Jesus himself taught similarly in Matthew 24:43. One way to express this would be:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Lord will come <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as unexpectedly</span> as a thief who comes at night (UBS handbook, p106).</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Day of the Lord:</strong> The phrase <em>the Day of the Lord</em> was a well-known phrase in the OT (for example, see Joel 2:31; Amos 5:18; Malachi 4:5). When this phrase occurred in the OT, “Lord” always referred to God the Father. The whole phrase therefore referred to the time when God would judge the people of the world and punish those who had sinned against him. However, in the NT, <em>the Lord</em> almost always refers to the Lord Jesus. So <em>the Day of the Lord</em> here means “the day when the Lord Jesus will return to earth.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will come:</strong> In some languages it may not be possible to say that a day/time will <u>come</u>. If this is the case in your language, you may need to talk about Jesus himself coming.</p>",

He was continuing the metaphor of a thief coming in the night (5:2b). Unbelievers are like a homeowner who is sleeping when the thief comes; they will not be ready when Jesus returns. However, Paul was warning believers not to be like this. They should be expecting Jesus to return.

He was probably thinking about Isaiah 59:17. See also Ephesians 6:11–18. Paul meant that Christians use their faith, love, and hope to protect themselves when the devil attacks them.

You should not translate it literally but use the appropriate method your language uses to signal a new section. This may be a special grammatical form, a specific word, or maybe nothing at all.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>brothers:</strong> See the note on 1:4.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to acknowledge:</strong> The Greek verb <em>oida</em>, which the BSB translates as <em>acknowledge</em>, literally means “to know,” but it has a wide range of other meanings. In this context it means “to respect, esteem, appreciate.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those who work diligently among you:</strong> Paul told the Thessalonians that they should respect their leaders not just because of their status as leaders but because of the way they worked to benefit all the believers in Thessalonica. Paul did not specify in this part of the verse what sort of work he was referring to. He was probably using a general expression here that he explained more fully in 5:12b–c.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is important to notice that here and in 5:12b–c Paul used three expressions to describe the same group of people, the leaders of the believers in Thessalonica. He was not talking about three different groups.

It can be translated as the BSB has done. Other possibilities are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who direct/guide you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who are your leaders</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the Lord:</strong> Scholars do not agree about what this phrase means here. There are two main possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means leaders “in spiritual matters.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in the Lord’s fellowship (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in the Christian life (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means that it was the Lord who had authorized the leaders.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow the first option (1), as it is supported by most commentators.</p><h4>5:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and give you instruction.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>warning you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">not to sin</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>give you instruction:</strong> The Greek word <em>noutheteō</em>, which the BSB translates as <em>give…instruction</em>, can mean:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “to admonish, warn.” <em>(NIV, RSV, NET, KJV, NJB, NLT).</em></p></li><li><p>It means “to advise, instruct.” <em>(BSB, GNT, GW, NCV, NASB, REB, JB).</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is difficult to decide between these two meanings here, as the meaning is usually determined by the context (for example in 5:14a, where it clearly means “warn”), but the context here does not assist the translator. However, the majority of commentators favor the first option because of the wider context, and it is recommended that you also translate this verb as “to admonish, warn.”</p>",

The word <em>huperekperissou</em>, which the BSB translates as <em>highest</em>, probably applies to this part of verse, as well as to <em>hold them in…regard</em>. Here, it would mean “love them greatly/exceedingly.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>hold them in highest regard:</strong> “To hold someone in regard” is another way in English of saying “to respect/esteem someone.” The verb is not the same in Greek as the one used in 5:12a, but the meaning is similar. Paul added the adverb <em>huperekperissou</em>, which the BSB translates as <em>highest</em>, in order to strengthen the verb. The Thessalonians were not only to respect their leaders, they were to respect them “greatly/exceedingly.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because of their work:</strong> Paul stated that the Thessalonian believers must respect and love their leaders, not because of their status, but because of what they were doing for the rest of the Thessalonian believers.</p><h4>5:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Live in peace with one another.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Behave peacefully with one another.</p></li><li><p>Do not quarrel with one another.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Live in peace with one another:</strong> Unlike the previous commands, this one was addressed to all the Christians in Thessalonica, including the leaders. But there is no need to make this explicit in your translation. Paul knew that the devil likes to cause believers to quarrel and so disrupt the fellowship that they have with one another. Paul gave similar commands in other letters too. For example, see 2 Corinthians 13:11.</p>",

The word <em>ataktos</em>, which the BSB translates as <em>unruly</em>, usually means “disorderly.” So commentators suggest two possible meanings here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to a specific form of disorderliness, that of being idle. Paul was therefore referring to a group of Thessalonian believers who had stopped working (see 1 Thessalonians 4:11–12) because they thought that Christ would return very soon. <em>(NIV, GNT, RSV, NCV, NLT, JB, REB)</em></p></li><li><p>The word should be understood literally to refer to those who were unruly or disorderly, that is, they refused to obey or respect their leaders. <em>(BSB, KJV, NJB, NASB, CEV, NET, GW)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The commentators are evenly divided between these two views. However, it is clear from 2 Thessalonians 3:6–12 that the first option was a real problem among the believers at Thessalonica.

There may also have been some who doubted that Christ had really saved them or felt that they had no spiritual gifts. However, you should not try to include these possibilities in your translation.</p><h4>5:14c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:14c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>help the weak,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>help those <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who are</span> weak <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in any way</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>help the weak:</strong> Commentators agree that Paul was not referring to those whose bodies were literally weak because they were sick or old, though he may have been including them. Rather, he was referring either to those who were weak spiritually or to those who were weak morally. There is nothing in the context that can clarify which group he meant. All English versions translate this phrase literally and it is recommended that you either follow them or include a phrase such as “in any way” to make it clear Paul that was not just talking about physical weakness.</p><h4>5:14d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:14d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and be patient with everyone.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and behave with patience towards every person.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>be patient with everyone:</strong> Scholars do not agree about whom Paul was referring to here.

Paul explained more fully what he meant in 5:23c.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>completely:</strong> This means that Paul wanted God to sanctify the Thessalonians in every part of their lives.</p><h4>5:23c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:23c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and may your entire spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">That is, I pray</span> that he will prevent your whole spirit and soul and body from sinning in any way until <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the day when</span> our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord Jesus Christ comes <span data-bnType=\"implied\">again</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">That is, I pray</span> that he will cause every part of you to be completely acceptable <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to him</span> until our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord Jesus Christ comes <span data-bnType=\"implied\">again</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and may your entire spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:</strong> Some commentators suggest that this sentence is the desired result of 5:23b. It is more likely, however, that Paul was expanding what he had said in 5:23b. He wanted the believers at Thessalonica to behave in a righteous manner so that when Christ returned, he would not be able to criticize or accuse them because of anything they had done. However, Paul knew that only God could help them behave like that.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>spirit, soul, and body:</strong> This is the only place in the New Testament where such a distinction is made. Paul probably used all three to emphasize that a person is a whole being, rather than because he intended to distinguish the three terms. If your language does not make a similar three-way distinction, it may be helpful to distinguish at least between the body and the part of a person that continues to live after the body dies. The important thing in your translation is to show that everything Christians do must be pleasing to God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:</strong> Paul was praying that God would enable them to be blameless from the present time until the Lord Jesus returned, so that when Jesus returned, he would judge them as having done nothing for which they deserved to be punished. See the notes on 3:13b and 3:13c.</p>",

Men kissed other men, and women kissed other women. This was particularly true within families. So it was appropriate for believers to greet one another by kissing them, as members of God’s family. Paul probably used the adjective <em>holy</em> to distinguish this greeting from the sort of kissing that might take place between a man and a woman. It is not clear from the text or from what we know about the culture at that time which part of the body they kissed. If believers kissing one another is not acceptable in your culture or if you have no term for kissing, translate the expression in a more general way, for example, “greet the brothers affectionately.” This expression is also used in Romans 16:16; 1 Corinthians 16:20; 2 Corinthians 13:12. 1 Peter 5:14 contains the expression “a kiss of love.”</p>",
