Then Jesus gave it to an angel, and the angel gave it to John. John wrote it in this book for all believers to read.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">These verses explain the purpose of the book, give information about the author, and offer a blessing to those who read the book.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Introduction</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Introduction to the book</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Opening remarks/words of the book</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Some translations do not start a book with a section heading.

God had caused it/them to be known to him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>This is the revelation of Jesus Christ:</strong> In Greek this phase is more literally “The revelation of Jesus Christ.” This phrase introduces the book. In some languages it is more natural to translate this phrase as a complete clause or sentence, as the BSB and some other English versions have done. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This is the revelation of Jesus Christ. (BSB, GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This <span data-bnType=\"implied\">book/letter/writing</span> is the revelation of Jesus Christ,</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase indicates that Jesus Christ revealed the things in this book to John. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This is a revelation from Jesus Christ, (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The revelation from Jesus Christ (NIV11)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This book is the record of the events that Jesus Christ revealed. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>revelation of Jesus Christ:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>revelation</em> refers to something unknown that someone shows/reveals to someone else. In some languages it is more natural to translate this phrase using a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>things revealed by Jesus Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>hidden things/knowledge that Jesus Christ told</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">hidden/secret</span> knowledge that Jesus Christ revealed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Christ:</strong> The word <em>Christ</em> is a title for Jesus. It means “the anointed one.” The Hebrew word <em>mashiah</em> (English: “Messiah”) has the same meaning. The Jews used it to refer to the person whom God promised would save/free his people and rule them. Here the word <em>Christ</em> describes Jesus as the <em>Christ</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate <em>Christ</em> are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a title or a descriptive phrase in your language that has the same meaning as <em>Christ</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> Anointed/Chosen One</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Promised</span> Deliverer</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Rescuer-King</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the major language word, spell it as people in your language would say it, and include a phrase that explains the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Karisiti, the appointed one</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Cristo, the Savior whom God promised to send</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the major language word, spell it as people in your language would say it, and indicate in some way that it is a title. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Kirisita</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the word Messiah, if it is more clearly a title used only for Jesus. Spell it as people in your language would say it and indicate in some way that it is a title. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the</span> Mesaaia<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The spelling <em>Mesaaia</em> is based on the usage in the Nalik NT, in progress, Papua New Guinea.</span></span></p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">If you have translated other New Testament books, see how you translated this word there. Also, if you have a footnote explaining this word in Matthew 1:1, Mark 1:1, Luke 2:11, or John 1:17, you may want to repeat it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>which God gave Him:</strong> This clause tells the reader more about the revelation. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that Jesus had other revelations but God only gave this one to him. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about this revelation. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It was given to him by God.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God gave it to him.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>gave:</strong> The word <em>gave</em> indicates that God showed these revelations to Jesus. In some languages a word other than <em>gave</em> is more natural. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>showed (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>told</p></blockquote><h4>1:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to show His servants what must soon come to pass.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>in order to show to his servants/slaves the things that are required to happen soon.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God showed/told him these things</span> so that his servants/workers might know the events that will certainly occur/happen soon.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>His servants:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>servants</em> refers to believers. It indicates that believers must obey the things God tells them to do.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word can also be translated as “slaves.” However, it is important not to indicate or imply that it is a position of shame or humiliation. A servant of God has a position of honor. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his workers</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the people who serve him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his people, they work for him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his people, they do his will</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His:</strong> The pronoun <em>His</em> probably refers here to God.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Compare the similar wording in Revelation 22:6.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>must soon come to pass:</strong> Here the phrase <em>must soon come to pass</em> indicates that the events in the revelation will certainly happen soon. God has decided that all these events will happen, so they will certainly happen. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>must soon happen (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>will soon necessarily/indeed occur</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>has been determined <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by God</span> to happen soon</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>will definitely/certainly occur soon</p></blockquote><h4>1:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He made it known by sending His angel to His servant John,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Jesus Christ showed it to his servant/slave John by sending his angel to him.</p></li><li><p>Jesus sent his angel/messenger to reveal these things to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">me,</span> John, his servant/worker.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He made…known:</strong> The person that the pronoun <em>He</em> refers to is unclear. It is probably Jesus. In some languages it is more natural to say to whom this pronoun refers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ made these things known (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>made…known:</strong> This phrase refers to revealing something through signs. Here, the signs are things and events that have symbolic meanings. There are many things that are symbolic in Revelation, for example: the dragon (12:3) and the woman on the scarlet beast (17:3).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Jesus communicated this revelation to believers by sending his angel with the revelation to John. The angel showed the revelation to John. John wrote this revelation and sent it to the believers. Other ways to translate these words are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>revealed through signs</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>communicated (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sent this revelation (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>show (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it:</strong> The pronoun <em>it</em> refers to the revelation, namely, the things that Jesus revealed (1:1a).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>His angel:</strong> The pronoun <em>His</em> probably refers here to Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>angel:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>angel</em> means “messenger.” It refers here to a spirit being who serves Christ. Some ways to translate this word are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a descriptive word or phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>messenger</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">good/holy</span> spirit-being</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a local word that fits the biblical meaning.</p></li><li><p>In some languages the churches may already be using the major language word for “angel.” Be sure that this word fits the biblical meaning. If some people do not know the right meaning from this word, you may want to indicate the meaning in some way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>angel messenger</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>sacred angel spirit</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Be sure that your word for “angel” is different from your words or phrases for “prophet” and “apostle.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to His servant John:</strong> The name <em>John</em> refers to the author himself. John wrote about himself in the third person. This was good Greek style. In some languages it is more natural to use the first person. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to his servant John, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">me</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">me</span> John, his servant</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His:</strong> This pronoun refers here to Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>servant:</strong> This word has the same meaning as it does in 1:1b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>John:</strong> The traditional view is that John the Apostle wrote this Revelation.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Swete and others.</span></span> But a second century Christian, Dionysius, thought is was someone named “John the Elder” and not John the Apostle.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Aune and others.</span></span> Many scholars refuse to choose which is most likely. It is best not to name this John as “the Apostle” or “the Elder.”</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:1a–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is more natural to follow the chronological order of communicating the message. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1a</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">This book is</span> the revelation of Jesus Christ. God gave it to him. <sup>1c</sup>He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John,<sup>1b</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He/God gave it to him</span> to show his/God’s servants what must soon take place. <sup>2a</sup>John testifies…</p></blockquote></div>",

This is the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ:</strong> The Greek words are literally “who testifies to the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ(,) whatever he saw.” The phrase “everything he saw” explains the phrase “This is the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.” In other words, both phrases refer to the messages, visions, and prophecies in this book. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who faithfully reported everything he saw. This is his report of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>John testified about what he saw: God’s word and the testimony about Jesus Christ. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who has told everything he has seen. It is the word of God; it is the message from Jesus Christ.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there were other people named John who received this message and only this John <em>testifies</em>. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about John. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>John testifies</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">and</span> I testify</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>testifies:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>testifies</em> means “to tell/report what one saw, heard, or knows.” The word is often used when the person speaking is expected to be truthful and accurate. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>faithfully reported (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>told…about (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>has borne witness (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek grammar is usually translated with the English past tense. Many English versions use the past tense here, as in the NLT example above. But since John will tell his readers the revelation <u>after</u> this, the BSB uses the present tense. The present tense in English here refers generally to what he wrote in this book. Use the tense that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>is testifying</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>testified</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>everything he saw:</strong> John implies everything that he heard as well. In some languages a literal translation would not imply that. If that is true in your language, include the implied meaning in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>everything he saw <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and heard</span></p></blockquote><h4>1:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>This is the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Indeed, he tells <span data-bnType=\"implied\">here</span> the word of/from God and the witness of/from Jesus Christ.</p></li><li><p>It is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">exactly</span> what God said <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to me</span> and the truth that Jesus Christ revealed.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>This is:</strong> In the Greek the phrase “everything he saw” explains the phrase “the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.” The BSB adds the words <em>This is</em> to indicate the connection between the two phrases. See the note on 1:2a–b for other ways to translate the connection between these phrases.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the word of God:</strong> The phrase <em>the word of God</em> here indicates that <em>the word</em> was <u>from</u> <em>God</em>. It is not one word but a message. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the message from God (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>this word from/of God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the true words of God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the things that God said <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to me</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the testimony of Jesus Christ:</strong> The word <em>of</em> here allows two meanings: the testimony that Jesus Christ spoke, and the testimony about Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The first meaning refers to what he said in chapters 2 and 3, his words in 22:7 to obey the words of this book, and in 22:16 he said that this book was a testimony that he sent to the churches.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The second meaning refers to what this book says about Jesus, for example 1:10–18 and 19:11–16.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Both meanings are true here. In many languages the word <em>of</em> allows both meanings. If that is true in your language, use <em>of</em> here. But some languages must choose one meaning or the other. If that is true in your language, translate the first meaning.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Aune (page 19) says, “‘the witness borne by Jesus’…seems more likely (and) suggests that the phrase…means ‘the contents of this book.’” Osbourne (page 56) says, “In 1:1–2…Jesus functions as the revealer of divine truth, and so the subjective sense is strongly favored by the context….”</span></span> Some ways to translate this phrase with that meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the truth revealed by Jesus Christ (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the message from Jesus Christ (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>testimony:</strong> The word <em>testimony</em> means “the words spoken about what one knows.” It implies that the spoken words are truthful and accurate.

In the Bible, the good situation results from God showing favor/kindness to the person.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This word does not primarily refer to a feeling. However, a person in this good situation will frequently have good feelings like happiness and joy. Do not use a word that <u>only</u> refers to material prosperity or physical health.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Favored</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>How good it is</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In a good/desirable position <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in God’s eyes</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Shown kindness <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by God</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This is the same word used in Matthew 5:3–11 in the Beatitudes.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>reads aloud:</strong> In Greek, the word that the BSB translates as <em>reads aloud</em> is more literally “reading.” The BSB supplies the word <em>aloud</em> because at that time the word “reading” normally referred to reading aloud, either to oneself or to others. People did not normally read silently. The context here implies reading aloud to a group (1:3b). However, if possible, translate this word so that it can refer to any kind of reading (See the ESV translation in the Display).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>prophecy:</strong> The word <em>prophecy</em> refers to a message that God gives to someone. The message may include a vision, as in Ezekiel 1 and Daniel 8. A <em>prophecy</em> may reveal something about past events, current events, or future events. The prophet speaks the <em>prophecy</em> to the people or writes it down for their use.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Many scholars believe that Revelation 2:1 through 3:22 are prophecies about things that were happening at the time John received this revelation. Many also believe that 4:1 through 22:17 are prophecies about future events.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages do not have a word for <em>prophecy</em>. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a descriptive phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>direct message from God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s <span data-bnType=\"implied\">new</span> message</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a message that God has revealed</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The word “prophecy” refers to a message that God gives to someone. The message may include a vision. A prophecy may reveal something about past events, current events, or future events.</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>1:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and blessed are those who hear and obey what is written in it,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and favored are those who hear it and obey the things that are written in it,</p></li><li><p>and the people who listen <span data-bnType=\"implied\">carefully</span> to it and follow it are <span data-bnType=\"implied\">also</span> in a good place <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in God’s eyes</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those who hear and obey what is written in it:</strong> John referred here to the people who were listening to someone reading this prophecy aloud (1:3a). He was indicating that people who <em>hear</em> the words of this prophecy also have to <em>obey what is written</em> before they are blessed.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>obey:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>obey</em> is literally “keep” (as in the RSV). Here the word “keep” refers to following what was said and valuing it. Other ways to translate the Greek word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>live according to it</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>do what is written in it (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>1:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because the time is near.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because the time <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for these things to occur</span> is near/soon.</p></li><li><p>for these events/prophecies will happen soon.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the time is near:</strong> This clause indicates that the events in this prophecy will happen soon.

He greeted them in the usual way that was done in letters at that time. He then praised Jesus and told the readers of this letter what its theme was.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Greetings to the Seven Churches (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>John introduced himself and greeted the seven churches</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Greeting <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and introduction</span> from John</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:4a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>John, To the seven churches in the province of Asia:</strong> After John introduced the content and purpose of this letter and announced a blessing (1:1–3), here he identified himself and those to whom he was writing. Other languages may use another order or other introduction words. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>From John to the seven churches in the province of Asia (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This letter is from John to the seven churches in the province of Asia (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>To the seven churches in the province of Asia. This letter is from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">me,</span> John</p></blockquote><h4>1:4a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:4a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>John,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">From</span> John,</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span> John <span data-bnType=\"implied\">am writing this letter</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>John:</strong> John is the name of the person who wrote the letter. In some languages it is more natural to make this clear by using the first-person pronoun, “I.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am</span> John. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I write</span> to the seven churches in Asia</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I,</span> John, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">am writing this letter</span> to the seven churches in the province of Asia</p></blockquote><h4>1:4b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:4b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>To the seven churches in the province of Asia:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to the seven churches in the province of Asia.</p></li><li><p>to the seven gatherings of believers <span data-bnType=\"implied\">which are</span> in the province of Asia.</p></li><li><p>to the communities of God’s people in the province of Asia.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>To the seven churches in the province of Asia:</strong> The phrase <em>the seven churches in the province of Asia</em> refers to seven groups of believers in Asia. The phrase does not imply that <u>only</u> seven groups of believers existed in Asia.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>seven churches:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>churches</em> refers generally to a gathering of people. Someone summoned the people for a particular purpose. Here, as almost always in the NT, it refers to groups of believers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the Bible this word never refers to church buildings. You also should not use a phrase that refers to separate groupings of churches where each group has its own name. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>seven congregations</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the believers <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who live in</span> seven cities</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the seven gatherings of believers</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the province of Asia:</strong> The BSB adds the phrase <em>the province of</em>. At that time the name “Asia” referred only to a small region in what is now the western part of the country of Turkey. But in English the name now refers to a large region of the world that includes the country of China. So the BSB and some English versions add the phrase <u>the province of</u> to indicate the old meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">You may also want to explain its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>At that time, the name Asia referred to a province under Roman rule that was across the Aegean Sea east of Greece. It was in the western part of what is now the country of Turkey.</p></blockquote><h4>1:4c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:4c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Grace and peace to you</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Grace and peace be yours (GNT)</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I pray that</span> you<sup>(plur)</sup> may experience/enjoy grace and peace</p></li><li><p>May you receive kindness/favor and well-being/harmonious-living</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Grace and peace to you:</strong> The saying <em>Grace and peace to you</em> was a common greeting among believers at that time. So authors of the books in the New Testament usually began their books that way.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This greeting has no verb. In some languages it is more natural to add a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">May</span> grace and peace <span data-bnType=\"implied\">be given</span> to you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">May</span> you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">receive</span> grace and peace</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Grace and peace be yours (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Grace:</strong> The word <em>Grace</em> here refers to God being kind to those who do not deserve it. God does things for people because he wants to and not because they earned it. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>kindness (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>help</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>favor</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is necessary to translate <em>Grace</em> using a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>voluntarily/graciously be kind</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>help <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as a gift/favor</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you need to translate <em>Grace</em> using a verb, you may need to reorder the sentence. This is discussed in the General Comment on 1:4c–5c.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>peace:</strong> In Jewish culture the word <em>peace</em> describes a situation of well-being that can include safety, wholeness, and health. It often describes harmony and friendship between God and people, or between individuals or groups of people. Other ways to translate <em>peace</em> here are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>harmony</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wellness</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is necessary to translate <em>peace</em> using a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>live whole/well/peacefully</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>be calm/peaceful</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Again, you may need to refer to the General Comment on 1:4c–5c for ways to reorder the sentence.</p><h4>1:4d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:4d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>from Him who is and was and is to come,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>from the one who is and was and is coming,</p></li><li><p>from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> who exists <span data-bnType=\"implied\">now</span>, and who has <span data-bnType=\"implied\">always</span> existed, and who is to come,</p></li><li><p>from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span>. He is the one who exists, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who</span> existed, and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who</span> is coming.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>from Him who is and was and is to come:</strong> These words refer to God. John described God here in the middle of his request for grace and peace.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">John described God using three phrases. In your translation, make sure that it is clear that the one <em>who is</em>, the one who <em>was</em>, and the one who <em>is to come</em> all refer to God. Other ways to translate this saying are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>from the One who is and was and is coming (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>from him who exists, who <span data-bnType=\"implied\">always</span> existed and who is coming</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>from God, who is, who was, and who is to come (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>is to come:</strong> The clause <em>is to come</em> uses a different Greek verb that the verb used in the previous two clauses. Those clauses use the verb meaning “be/exist.” The verb in this clause probably refers to God coming to do the things written in this book. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who is still to come (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who is coming (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The clause <em>is to come</em> does <u>not</u> refer to Jesus returning. So you should not translate this as “who is to return.”</p><h4>1:4e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:4e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and from the seven Spirits before His throne,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>from the seven spirits in front of his throne,</p></li><li><p>and from the sevenfold Spirit who is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in his presence</span> before his ruling place/seat,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">May you also receive kindness/favor and well-being/calm</span> from the seven spirits <span data-bnType=\"implied\">serving God</span> in front of his throne.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>from the seven Spirits:</strong> This phrase is connected to “Grace and peace to you” (1:4c). It indicates that John also asked the seven spirits to give grace and peace.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the seven Spirits:</strong> Many scholars believe that the phrase <em>the seven Spirits</em> is a symbolic reference to the Holy Spirit.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Beale, Swete, Smalley, Osbourne, Lenski, Kistemaker, Johnson, Beckwith, and Hughes.</span></span> The number <em>seven</em> then represents completion or perfection. Other scholars believe that the phrase refers to seven angels.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Aune and Charles.</span></span> These angels could be either seven archangels, or seven other spirits who serve God. Since the meaning of this phrase is not clear, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Translate literally. You may also want to explain the various opinions about its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Scholars have several opinions about the words “the seven spirits.” Some think the words refer symbolically to the Holy Spirit. Others think the words refer to seven angels of highest rank. Others think that the words refer to seven spirits of a special kind that only serve God at the throne.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Indicate that the phrase refers symbolically to the Holy Spirit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Spirit <span data-bnType=\"implied\">symbolized by</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the word/number</span> seven <em>If you do that, then you may want to include a footnote to indicate the literal words. An example footnote is:</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Literally: “the seven spirits.” John may have used this phrase to refer to the Holy Spirit, seven angels of highest rank, or seven spirits of a special kind who serve God at the throne.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>before His throne:</strong> Here the phrase <em>before His throne</em> indicates that the seven spirits are always in God’s presence. It is implied that God is seated on his throne. It is more clear in some languages to indicate the implied information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>before the throne <span data-bnType=\"implied\">where God is seated</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>throne:</strong> This word refers to the official chair of a king. When the king is seated on his <em>throne</em>, he rules over his people and his country. Therefore, the word <em>throne</em> is a symbol for authority to rule. Another way to translate this word is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>leader’s place to rule</p></blockquote>",

John asked God, the seven spirits, and Jesus to give grace and peace to the believers. He also described God, the seven spirits, and Jesus. In some languages it is more natural to:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>First translate the three descriptions, and then translate what John wanted each one to do.

It includes a long description of Jesus (1:5d–1:6a). At the end of the sentence (1:6b), John described glory and power as belonging to Jesus. In some languages it is more natural to use two or more shorter sentences. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5d</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus Christ</span> loves us <sup>5e</sup>and has freed us from our sins by his own blood. <sup>6a</sup>He has made us to be a kingdom, priests to serve his God and Father. <sup>6b</sup>To him be glory and power forever and ever!

There are several ways to interpret the Greek phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It indicates that the words <em>priests</em> and <em>kingdom</em> <u>describe the same thing, as in the RSV</u>. <em>(BSB, RSV, NASB, NABRE, GW, NET, REB, ESV)</em></p></li><li><p>It indicates that the <em>kingdom</em> <u>consists of</u> <em>priests</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>made us a kingdom of priests (GNT) <em>(GNT, NJB, NLT, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It indicates <u>two things unconnected or only loosely connected with each other</u>. He made his people to be <em>a kingdom</em>, and he also made them <em>priests</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He has made us his kingdom and his priests (NLT96) <em>(NIV, NLT96)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because the Greek words do not have “and” here, nor the grammar indicating “of.” <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Hughes, Aune, Swete, and Lenski support interpretation (1). Swete (page 8) says that adding <em>and</em> or <em>of</em> “are needless attempts to save the grammar.”</span></span> Other ways to translate these words according to interpretation (1) are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>made us a kingdom, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that is,</span> priests</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>made us a kingdom. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">He also made us</span> priests</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>made us to be a kingdom:</strong> These words mean “has caused us to become a united group under one king/leader.” God is the king. Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>has caused us to become a nation/tribe/people-group</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>has appointed us as a kingdom (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>priests to His God and Father:</strong> The Greek words are literally “priests to his God and Father” (as in the BSB). This is a metaphor. Believers are like priests.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">They are like priests because they serve God as a way of life. They devote themselves to doing what God wants them to do. There are several ways to translate this figure of speech:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>priests for God his Father (GW)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Change the metaphor to a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to become like priests of his Father God</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those who serve/worship God his Father</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Keep the metaphor or simile <em>priests</em> and explain the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>priests serving his God and Father (NET)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this figure of speech in a way that makes the meaning clear in your language. Whether you are able to keep the figure of <em>priests</em> will depend partly on the role and function of priests in your culture. See the following note.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>priests:</strong> A Jewish priest was a religious leader who:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>offered sacrifices to God for the people,</p></li><li><p>led the people in worship, and</p></li><li><p>taught the people about God.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Here the word <em>priests</em> refers figuratively to people who serve God as a way of life. They worship God and help others to worship him also. Since Jesus died on the cross as our sacrifice, Christians do not offer sacrifices. If your usual word or phrase for <em>priests</em> focuses on sacrificing animals and food, you should translate the figurative meaning of <em>priests</em> here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who always serve God his Father</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people doing his Father God’s will/desire as a way of life</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His God and Father:</strong> The pronoun <em>His</em> refers to Jesus. The word <em>Father</em> refers to <em>God</em>. In your translation, make sure that it is clear that the phrases <em>His God</em> and <em>Father</em> both refer to the one true God. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God his Father (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his God and Father</p></blockquote><h4>1:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to Him be the glory and power forever and ever!

It is so.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to Him be the glory and power:</strong> The Greek words are literally “to him glory and power.” There is no verb in the Greek. The BSB and many other English versions add the verb <em>be</em>. This phrase indicates that John agreed that Jesus had glory and power. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to him is glory and power</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he is the one who is great and who has power forever</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>glory and power belong to him</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to Him:</strong> The pronoun <em>Him</em> refers to Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>glory:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>glory</em> here refers to the recognition of God having great status. He is greater than anything a person could think of.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See also Luke 2:14, Romans 11:36, Ephesians 3:21, or Philippians 4:20 for the same use of the word <em>glory</em>.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>power:</strong> This word refers to the ability and authority to cause things to happen. It does not refer to physical strength here. The RSV translates it as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>dominion</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>forever and ever:</strong> The Greek words are “into the ages of the ages.” It means “always” or “eternally.” Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for evermore</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for all ages to come</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Amen:</strong> The word <em>Amen</em> is a Hebrew word that means “even so” or “it is true.” It is used to agree with what was said. The Greek borrowed the Hebrew word. English borrowed this word as well.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages people are not familiar with this word. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:5d–6b</strong></h5><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Translate the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is so.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>True!</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Borrow this word and spell it as people in your language would say it. You may then want to explain its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The word “amen” means “even so” or “it is true.”</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">These clauses contain a description of Jesus Christ and what he has done (1:5d–6a), followed by a call to praise him (1:6b). In some languages it is more natural to translate 1:6b first, and then tell about who Jesus is and what he did (1:5d–6a). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6b</sup>Glory and power be to him! <sup>5d</sup>He has loved us <sup>5e</sup>and shed his blood to free us from our sins! <sup>6a</sup>And he has made us into a kingdom, priests to serve his God and Father!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">If you do this, you will need to combine the verses as “5–6.”</p></div><h4>1:5d–6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:5d–6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(reordered) He who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and Father has glory and power for ever and ever!

He will come soon with the clouds around him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Behold:</strong> The word emphasizes or calls attention to the words that follow. The word is also used here in a somewhat literal sense, because when Jesus does come, people will indeed see him. Translate this in a way that is natural in your language for talking about a wonderful or amazing event that people will see. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Hey/Wow</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Remember/Consider this:</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He is coming with the clouds:</strong> The pronoun <em>He</em> refers to Jesus Christ here. John named him in 1:5a. In some languages it is more natural to translate the pronoun <em>He</em> using his name because of the many words used following the mention of his name in 1:5a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jesus is coming with the clouds (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is similar to prophecies in the Gospels, including Matthew 24:30. This clause is also similar to Daniel 7:13. You may want a footnote to explain the connection to those prophecies. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This clause is like the prophecy in Matthew 24:30. It is also similar to Daniel 7:13.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>He is coming:</strong> This phrase uses the present tense. John used the present tense to emphasize that Jesus is <u>definitely</u> coming <u>soon</u>. However, the rest of the verse uses the future tense. In some languages it is more natural to use the future tense here also. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He will definitely come soon</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>with the clouds:</strong> This phrase indicates that clouds will be near Jesus as he returns.

Here it refers to the soldiers who pierced Jesus with nails and to the soldier who pierced him with a spear. But the phrase also refers to the leaders who ordered the soldiers to pierce him. More generally, it includes all people who are enemies of Jesus (John 19:34, 37).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to say how people <em>pierced</em> Jesus. But the important point is that these people caused Jesus to die. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who pierced his skin <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with nails and spear</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who nailed him to a cross <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so that he would die</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the people who caused him to die by nailing him to a cross</p></blockquote><h4>1:7d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:7d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And all the tribes of the earth will mourn because of Him.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and all the people-groups of the world will grieve regarding him.</p></li><li><p>and all the tribes/nations on earth will sorrow greatly on account of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">seeing</span> him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>all the tribes of the earth:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>tribes</em> refers to people grouped by language or culture.

(2) Some early Greek manuscripts have the phrases <u>the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end</u> (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1), because the UBS Greek NT recommends it. The NLT follows option (1) but explains the idiom in the text: “the Alpha and the Omega—the beginning and the end,” as the footnote in the NLT shows.</span></span> <em>Alpha</em> is the name of the first letter of the Greek alphabet. <em>Omega</em> is the name of the last letter of that alphabet.

The BSB also places the verb <em>says</em> before the phrase <em>the Lord God</em>. That order is a poetic English style. The BSB word order follows the Greek word order literally. You should place this phrase where it is most natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>says:</strong> John probably used the present tense to indicate that God always describes himself as the Alpha and the Omega.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Lord God:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Lord</em> means “the one in authority over (others),” or “owner.” Here the word is used to indicate that God has authority over all things. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God the Lord</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Sovereign God</p></blockquote><h4>1:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who is and was and is to come—the Almighty.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He is the one who is and was and is coming, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> All-Powerful.</p></li><li><p>God exists <span data-bnType=\"implied\">now</span>, and has <span data-bnType=\"implied\">always</span> existed, and will come.

The people in the seven churches had also suffered for the sake of Jesus. So John indicated that they all shared in that suffering. He explained where he was and why he was there. He then began to tell his vision of Jesus and what Jesus revealed to him.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Preliminary vision (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>John told/described his first vision</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Introduction to what God revealed to John</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:9a–e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9a–e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(reordered) I, John, </strong><span data-bnType=\"implied\"><strong>proclaimed</strong></span><strong> the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I, John, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">speak/write to you.</span> I,…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I <span data-bnType=\"implied\">am</span> John,…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>your brother:</strong> Here the word <em>brother</em> indicates that John was also a believer, like believers in the churches. Using the word <em>brother</em> indicates that he had a close relationship with his readers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate a literal brother. If that is true in your language, you may need to:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Explain the meaning in your translation.

Here John and the believers shared faith in Jesus. They also shared in suffering for Jesus’ sake, and in being part of God’s kingdom, and in enduring (1:9b). Other ways to translate the Greek word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>companion (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">one</span> who shares with</p></blockquote><h4>1:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in the tribulation and kingdom and perseverance</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>in persecution, in the kingdom, and in patience to endure</p></li><li><p>in suffering hardship, in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">doing</span> the King’s <span data-bnType=\"implied\">work</span> and in enduring/persevering,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the tribulation and kingdom and perseverance:</strong> This phrase indicates that John and his readers shared in three things. They shared in <em>tribulation</em>, they shared in the <em>kingdom</em>, and they shared in <em>perseverance</em>. The three abstract nouns <em>tribulation</em>, <em>kingdom</em>, and <em>perseverance</em> can all be translated as verbs, since they refer to something that John and his readers did together. They all suffered, they all lived in God’s kingdom, and they all endured patiently.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the Greek, these three things are closely connected in the grammar.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>All three are datives under one Greek article.</span></span> So some English versions interpret the grammar to indicate that the terms modify each other rather than refer to three separate actions. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in patiently enduring the suffering that comes to those who belong to his Kingdom (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, in some languages it is more natural to translate them as three separate actions. See examples in the Display.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>tribulation:</strong> The word <em>tribulation</em> refers to the trouble and pain that people endure. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>suffering (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>hardships (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we<sup>(incl)</sup> all suffer troubles</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>kingdom:</strong> The word <em>kingdom</em> refers to God ruling over his people. John and his readers were companions in the <em>kingdom</em> because they all belonged to God’s kingdom. They all acknowledged God as their king, and they all lived under God’s rule. John and his readers shared in the blessings of the kingdom and its work.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is necessary or more natural to add a verb here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">we</span> <sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all belong to</span> God’s kingdom</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>together <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we follow</span> God as king</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">all of us live</span> under God’s rule</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>perseverance:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>perseverance</em> refers to continuing to follow God even though facing hardships or opposition. Other ways to translate the Greek word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>patient endurance (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>patience to continue (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we(incl) all patiently endure</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>how we patiently endure <span data-bnType=\"implied\">difficulties/suffering/persecution</span></p></blockquote><h4>1:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that are in Jesus,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>in Jesus,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">since</span> we<sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all</span> follow Jesus together.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that are in Jesus:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>that are in Jesus</em> probably applies to the whole phrase “your brother and partner in the tribulation and kingdom and perseverance” (1:9a–b). All those things are true or occur <u>in a relationship with Jesus</u>. John and his readers had a relationship with Jesus, so they suffered for the same reasons, shared in the kingdom of God, and patiently endured troubles for the same reasons.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Your translation of this phrase should refer to those shared experiences. Other ways to translate it are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as we (incl) are all in Jesus</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as we follow Jesus together</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:9a–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is more natural to put the phrase “in Jesus” in a different place. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>9a</sup>I John, your brother, who share with you <sup>9c</sup><u>in Jesus</u> <sup>9b</sup>the tribulation and the kingdom and the patient endurance (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>9a</sup>I am John, your brother, and <sup>9c</sup><u>as a follower of Jesus</u> <sup>9a</sup>I am your partner <sup>9b</sup>in patiently enduring the suffering that comes to those who belong to his Kingdom (GNT)</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:9d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>was on the island of Patmos</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>was <span data-bnType=\"implied\">put/exiled</span> on the island <span data-bnType=\"implied\">called</span> Patmos</p></li><li><p>I was <span data-bnType=\"implied\">sent to</span> Patmos Island</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>was on the island of Patmos:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>was</em> can also be translated as “came to be.” John did not plan to be on Patmos. It happened because God planned it. The Greek grammar does not indicate whether or not John was still on Patmos when he wrote Revelation after receiving these visions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">1:9e probably implies that the Roman authorities exiled John to Patmos. So some English versions use a passive clause. The passive clause in English implies that John did not go to the island voluntarily. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I was sent to Patmos Island (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I was put on the island of Patmos (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">But the verb <em>was</em> probably indicates that, for this letter, it was not important to John whether or not he was exiled.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the island of Patmos:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>of</em> is literally “being called.” It indicates that <em>Patmos</em> was the name of the island. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the island called Patmos (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Patmos Island (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>island:</strong> An <em>island</em> is land that is completely surrounded by water. Patmos is in the Aegean Sea. It is about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the mainland, which was the Roman province of Asia. Patmos is about 12 kilometers (8 miles) long from the northern end to the southern end. It is about 3 kilometers (2 miles) wide at its widest place.</p><h4>1:9e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because of the word of God and my testimony about Jesus.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because of the word from God and the witness of/about Jesus.</p></li><li><p>because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I proclaimed</span> the word from God and testified/witnessed about Jesus.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because of the word of God and my testimony about Jesus:</strong> This clause indicates that someone, probably Roman authorities, put John on Patmos (as punishment) <em>because</em> he preached <em>the word of God and my testimony about Jesus</em>. The Roman emperor insisted that everyone worship him as a god. Those who believed in Jesus refused to do that. The Roman authorities probably exiled John to Patmos because he was preaching about believing in Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Osborne (page 82) says, “The context with Patmos here makes it more likely, however, that the two phrases speak of the reason John was exiled. Still, the meaning is similar to that of 1:2. The two phrases mean that John was banished because of his preaching ‘the word of God’ and ‘witnessing for Jesus.’” Aune, Beale, Lenski, and Smalley also support this interpretation.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">There is no subject or verb in this phrase. John was probably talking about himself and what he did. In some languages it is more natural to make the subject and verb/verbs explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I proclaimed</span> the word of God and the testimony of Jesus</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because I had preached God’s word and the message about Jesus (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I had declared</span> God’s word and told/testified about Jesus</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>of the word of God and my testimony about Jesus:</strong> Here the phrase refers to an earlier time when John was still in the province of Asia. John used the same phrase in 1:2 to connect to that verse, but he implies a connected-but-different meaning. Here it refers more generally to the Scriptures and the gospel about Jesus. John preached the gospel in Asia. Other ways to translate it are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>of the Word of God and of witness to Jesus (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for preaching the word of God and for my testimony about Jesus (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>of God’s word and the testimony about Jesus (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>my testimony about Jesus:</strong> In Greek this phrase is literally “the testimony of Jesus” (as in the ESV). The word “of” has several meanings. There are two ways to interpret this phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The <em>testimony</em> is <u>about</u> Jesus. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the testimony about Jesus (GW) <em>(BSB, NJB, NABRE, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, REB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p><u>Jesus gave</u> the <em>testimony</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the truth that Jesus revealed (GNT) <em>(GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Many English versions translate this literally as “of.” It is not possible to tell which interpretation they follow. You may also translate this phrase so that it allows both interpretations. But some languages must choose one of the interpretations. If that is true in your language, follow interpretation (1). Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I…had told about Jesus (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I had…borne witness to Jesus (JBP)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>testimony:</strong> The word <em>testimony</em> means “the words spoken about what one saw or heard.” The word <em>testimony</em> is often used when the person speaking is expected to be truthful and accurate (as in a court of law). Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>witness (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>message of what they saw and heard</p></blockquote>",

But ancient Greek writers used only one style of letters. So the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Spirit</em> can refer to either the human spirit or God’s Spirit. There are several ways to interpret it. The main interpretations are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It indicates that John was connected to the Holy Spirit <u>in some way that was different from the usual experience of the Holy Spirit</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Spirit came upon me (REB) <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NASB, GW, CEV, NET, REB, NCV, ESV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It indicates that John entered a trance-like state and <u>experienced things in his own spirit</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was in ecstasy (NJB) <em>(NJB, NRSV, NABRE)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Beale (page 203) says the text “uses the language of the prophet Ezekiel’s repeated rapture in the Spirit.” Kistemaker, Hughes, Mounce, Smalley, and Osbourne translate it as “in the Spirit.”</span></span> Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I came to be in the Spirit</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I came under the Spirit’s power (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I was in strong relationship with the Spirit</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I was:</strong> The verb here is the same Greek verb as in 1:9d. In 1:9d John physically “came to be” on the island of Patmos. Here in 1:10a, he spiritually “came to be” in the Spirit. John did not plan to be in the Spirit. It happened because God made it happen.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The verb does not indicate or imply being forced. But the phrase “in the Spirit” implies that the Holy Spirit began a closer connection to John’s spirit. See examples above.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in the Spirit:</strong> As interpretation (1) above indicates, John was connected to the Holy Spirit in a way that was different from the usual experience of the Holy Spirit. It does not say what circumstance John was in. It is not known if he was worshiping with others or worshiping on his own or praying or if he was in some other situation when John experienced the Holy Spirit in this way.</p><h4>1:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and I heard a loud voice <span data-bnType=\"implied\">speaking</span> like a trumpet behind me,</p></li><li><p>I heard a loud voice <span data-bnType=\"implied\">speaking</span> behind me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that sounded</span> like a trumpet.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a loud voice like a trumpet:</strong> This phrase does not explain how the <em>loud voice</em> was <em>like a trumpet</em>. It may have been that it was loud and clear, like a trumpet call. If you need to say how it was <em>like a trumpet</em>, you may want to make that explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a loud voice that sounded like a trumpet (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a trumpet:</strong> The word <em>trumpet</em> refers to a musical instrument that was often used to alert people to danger. It was also used to announce important messages. At that time trumpets were made from metal or from animal horns. A metal <em>trumpet</em> was a narrow tube probably about half a meter (18 inches) long. It had a mouthpiece at one end and a wide opening at the other end. People blew into it to produce a loud sound.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The particular kind of <em>trumpet</em> is not important here. In some languages people use trumpets made of animal horns, shells, bamboo, or other materials. If that is true in your language, you may want to use the word for that kind of trumpet here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages do not have a word for trumpet. If that is true in your language, you can:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a word for another loud instrument, preferably one that someone blows into.</p></li><li><p>Use a method of announcing in your area.</p></li><li><p>Use the major language word.</p></li></ul>",

(2) One early Greek manuscript has the phrase <u>saying, I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, and</u> (KJV only).

John probably wrote on a scroll. A <em>scroll</em> is a long piece of writing material.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>At that time people used parchment or papyrus rather than paper such as we use now. People made parchment from sheep or goat skins. People made papyrus paper from the stalks of the papyrus plant.</span></span> After writing on it, it is rolled into a cylinder shape.

A scroll of perhaps five meters (sixteen feet) in length would be needed to write the Revelation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Whether John used a scroll or a book is not important here. Some languages do not have a word for <em>scroll</em>.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to see who was speaking (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to see the person who spoke with that voice</p></blockquote><h4>1:12b–13c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In these verses the lampstands, the long robe, and the sash may imply a situation similar to that of a Jewish priest leading worship at the temple. A priest wore a long robe and sash, and a lampstand stood in the temple. These things may also imply high status for Jesus. Your translation should allow for one or both implied meanings.</p><h4>1:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>When I turned around, I saw seven gold lampstands.</p></li><li><p>and then I saw seven lampstands made of gold,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And having turned:</strong> John already referred to the action of turning in 1:12a. So referring to it a second time here <u>emphasizes that action and what John saw</u>. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And immediately upon turning</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And when I turned (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and so/indeed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>golden:</strong> The word <em>golden</em> indicates that the lampstands were made of gold. Gold is a rare metal of a somewhat yellow color. It was the most expensive metal at that time. It is naturally shiny and beautiful. Below is a picture of a gold coin made in the Roman era of Caesar Augustus (who was the Roman emperor when Jesus was born).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages do not have a word for “gold.” If that is true in your language, you should use the word from the major language in your area. The people in your language may not be familiar with gold. If that is true in your language, you may want to include a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Gold is a rare metal of a somewhat yellow color. It was the most expensive metal at that time. It is naturally shiny and beautiful.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>lampstands:</strong> A lampstand is a 1–2 meter (3–6 feet) tall rack or pillar for holding a lamp. It has a place for a lamp on its top. This context implies that there were lamps on the lampstands. There were many kinds and styles of lampstand. John did not say what kind of lampstand he saw. The drawing here only shows generally what lampstands look like.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">A lamp in John’s time was a small clay or metal container in which people burned oil. The lamp was shaped to hold a wick on one side. The exact kind of lamp is not important here. So if you translate the term <em>lampstand</em> with a phrase that means “a holder for a lamp,” in that phrase you should use a word that refers generally to a lamp or light-producing device. Some of the styles of lamps used in John’s time are shown below.</p>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">standing</span> in the middle/midst of</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>One like the Son of Man:</strong> The phrase <em>the Son of Man</em> is based on the Hebrew idiom that refers to someone who has the characteristics of a man. So here it means “a human being.” John probably implies a connection to Daniel 7:13. There, Daniel saw someone who looked like a person (rather than an angel or other kind of being) coming on the clouds. Daniel said he was “like a son of man.” This phrase probably implies three things:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>This person was the Christ. This whole phrase is <u>similar to the phrase in Daniel 7:13</u>. Many Jews in Jesus’ time understood that Daniel 7:13–14 described the Christ. John probably wanted to remind his readers of those verses in Daniel.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Beale, page 210, Osbourne, page 87.</span></span></p></li><li><p>This person was Jesus. The phrase <em>the Son of Man</em> is <u>similar to the phrase “the Son of Man” that Jesus often used for himself</u>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Swete, page 15, Lenski, page 64.</span></span></p></li><li><p>This person looked like a human being. In Hebrew the phrase <em>Son of</em> means “someone having the characteristics of.” John <u>saw a being who looked like a person, but with the differences described in 1:14–16</u>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Translator’s Handbooks (on TW) mentions this option and the other two as well.</span></span></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this phrase are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate literally. You may want to translate literally if you translated “the Son of Man” literally in the Gospels. You may then want to explain the meaning of the phrase in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The saying “someone like a son of man” would remind believers of those words in Daniel 7:13–14. This saying would also remind them of Jesus’ title for himself: “the Son of Man.” <em>Keep the word Man general rather than referring to an unknown man; that is, do not say or imply “a son of </em><u><em>a</em></u><em> man” or “a son of </em><u><em>the</em></u><em> man.”</em></p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Note:</strong> Some languages do not have the word “the” or “a,” but the meaning is understood from context. But without a “the” or “a,” there is no clear way to translate the difference between “the Son of Man” and “a son of man.” If that is true in your language, you should translate as indicated below.</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate according to meaning (c) above. Some examples are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>there was what looked like a human being (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a figure like a man (REB) <em>You may want to include a footnote to explain the literal words. An example footnote is:</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Literally: “someone like a son of man.” This saying would remind believers of those words in Daniel 7:13–14. This saying would also remind them of Jesus’ title for himself: “the Son of Man.” But here John is only indicating that he saw someone who looked somewhat like a human being, and this person’s appearance in 1:13–16 and his words in 1:17–20 indicate that he is Jesus. <em>If you do not have “the” and “a” in your language, you may want a different footnote. For example:</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Literally: “someone like son of man.” This saying is a Hebrew idiom that means “someone who looks like a human being.” It would remind believers of those words in Daniel 7:13–14. Jesus used these words as a title for himself: “the Son of Man.” But here John is only indicating that he saw someone who looked somewhat like a human being, and this person’s appearance in 1:13–16 and his words in 1:17–20 indicate that he is Jesus.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Note:</strong> You should <u>not</u> translate this phrase as “someone like <u>the</u> Son of Man.” Translating that way indicates that the person whom John saw was not Jesus but someone <u>like</u> him. But 1:18 shows that this phrase does refer to Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>like the Son of Man:</strong> This phrase is a quote from Daniel 7:13. If you usually footnote the location of quotes from the Old Testament, you may want to do so here.</p><h4>1:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>dressed in a long robe,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>who wore a robe that went to his feet</p></li><li><p>He was clothed in a full-length robe</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>dressed in:</strong> This phrase indicates that Jesus was <u>wearing</u> the robe. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>clothed with (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>wearing (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a long robe:</strong> This phrase refers to a long loose garment which covers the body from the shoulders down to the feet. A robe also has loose sleeves covering the arms.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages people are not familiar with robes.

The clause may also imply strength or moral purity. The clause does not indicate that his feet were hard or unbending like metal.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>bronze:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>bronze</em> refers to a metal that is a mixture of copper and another metal, either tin (which makes <em>bronze</em>) or zinc (which makes brass).

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>shiny brown/tan metal</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the major language word.

So you may want to use plural verbs and pronouns in chapters 2–3 to refer to the believers.</p>",

The English versions usually translate the Greek word as <em>angel</em>. See how you translated this word in 1:1 or 1:20.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>church:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>church</em> refers generally to a gathering of people. Someone summoned the people for a particular purpose. Here, as almost always in the NT, it refers to groups of believers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the Bible this word never refers to church buildings. You also should not use a phrase that refers to separate groupings of churches where each group has its own name. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>congregation</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the believers <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who live</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the gathering of believers</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 1:4.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Ephesus:</strong> Ephesus was an important city, a center for trade and the pagan worship of the goddess Artemis. In some languages it is helpful to explain what Ephesus was. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the city of/called</span> Ephesus</p></blockquote><h4>2:1b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Some English versions use quotation marks at the beginning of 2:1b because it begins telling what John was told to write. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>‘The words of him… (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“This is the message… (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Introduce what John was told to write in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>These are the words of Him who holds the seven stars in His right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands:</strong> The Greek words are literally “The one holding seven stars in his right hand and walking among the seven golden lampstands says these things.” The Greek word for “these” refers to the words in 2:2–7. The whole clause here is an introduction to 2:2–7. Other ways to translate it are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>This is the message</u> from the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand and who walks among the seven gold lampstands (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>The message</u> of him who is holding the seven stars in his right hand and walking among the seven golden lampstands <u>is this</u>:</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Jesus spoke these words about himself. He continues to speak in 2:2, using the pronoun “I.” In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that Jesus was talking about someone else here. If that is true in your language, indicate that Jesus spoke about himself. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>These are my words, and I hold the seven stars in my right hand and walk among the seven golden lampstands</p></blockquote><h4>2:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>These are the words of Him who holds the seven stars in His right hand</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>This message is from the one holding the seven stars in his right hand</p></li><li><p>Here is the message from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">me,</span> the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Him…His:</strong> Jesus referred to himself here.

Some of the lampstands may have been in front of Jesus, and some may have been behind him as well. See how you translated <em>among</em> in 1:13.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the seven golden lampstands:</strong> A lampstand is a stand with a place/platform for a lamp on top. This context implies that there are lamps on the lampstands. See how you translated <em>the seven golden lampstands</em> in 1:12.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:1b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is more natural to identify the speaker before introducing the message.

They refer to the angel of the church as the representative of all the believers there. But it was the believers who had been working hard and persevering. So in many languages it is more natural to use plural pronouns here.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>deeds:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>deeds</em> means “actions” or “accomplishments.” Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>activities (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the things that you have done</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to translate the word <em>deeds</em> with a verb.

It says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent. (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The phrase “If not” can also be translated as “If you do not do that.” The BSB combines the Greek phrases “if not” and “unless you repent.” The BSB also places them together at the beginning of the sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But if you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Another way to order the phrases is to reverse 2:5d and 2:5c:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5d</sup>I will come to you and take your lamp stand from its place <sup>5c</sup>if you don’t change.

Here Jesus used this saying to urge or warn the believers to think carefully about what he had just said.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages there is a similar saying/proverb urging people to listen carefully to what someone says. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use it here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Everyone must give their ears to me</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Explain this saying in a footnote using your saying. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This means “give your ears to me.”</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>2:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He who has an ear,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">If/since</span> you<sup>(plur)</sup> have ears,</p></li><li><p>Everyone who has ears <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that can hear</span></p></li><li><p>Whoever is able to hear</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He who has an ear:</strong> The phrase <em>He who has an ear</em> figuratively means “Anyone who can hear.” The word <em>ear</em> is a figure of speech representing the ability to hear. It also can refer to the ability to receive information any other way. Jesus was speaking to everyone who hears or receives what he just said in 2:1–6. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If you have ears (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Every person who has ears (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Anyone with ears to hear (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Since you have received <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what I just said</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Can you hear?</p></blockquote><h4>2:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>then hear the things that the Spirit is saying to the churches.</p></li><li><p>should give careful attention to what the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Holy</span> Spirit says to the gatherings of believers.</p></li><li><p>should understand and heed/obey what <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> Spirit says to the communities of God’s people.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>let him hear:</strong> This command is addressed to everyone who hears or receives what he just said in 2:1–6. It indicates that everyone should pay attention to his message. Other ways to translate it are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>then listen</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>do not ignore what you hear</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>then you should pay attention to</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>what the Spirit says to the churches:</strong> This refers to everything Jesus said in 2:1–3:22. It probably also refers to all of Revelation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Spirit:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the Spirit</em> refers to the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is God together with God the Father and God the Son. The Holy Spirit is <em>Spirit</em> in the sense that he is a living being who does not have a physical body. He is <u>Holy</u> in the sense that he is God. He is perfect in every way and is completely pure and sinless.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would not clearly refer to the Holy Spirit. If this is true in your language, you may want to include the implied information in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Spirit/Breath <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of/from God</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Holy/Pure/Sacred</span> Spirit</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Do not imply that <em>the Spirit</em> is like the ghost of a dead person or that God has died.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>churches:</strong> This word is plural. It indicates that believers everywhere are to understand and use the teachings in chapters 2–3. See how you translated this word in 1:4.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:7a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">2:7a–b is addressed to everyone who can hear. So in some languages it is more natural to use a pronoun other than the third person singular (“he”). These words may be the second person plural or singular (“you”), or the third person plural (“everyone”). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">All</span> you(plur) who have ears, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Everyone who has ears should listen to the things the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Holy</span> Spirit says to the churches!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If you(sing) have ears, listen to what the Spirit says to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">these</span> churches!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Since everyone has ears, they must use them to listen <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and obey</span> what the Spirit says to these churches!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do you(sing) have ears? Then listen to the words that the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Holy</span> Spirit says to the churches!</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:7c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:7c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>To the one who overcomes,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>To anyone who gains victory,</p></li><li><p>To you<sup>(plur)</sup> who defeat/conquer <span data-bnType=\"implied\">everything that causes a believer to stumble</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>To the one who overcomes:</strong> The phrase <em>To the one who overcomes</em> is emphasized by being first in the clause. If you have a natural way in your language to emphasize this phrase, you may want to do so. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>To him who conquers, I will grant (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>To those who win the victory I will give (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is not natural to have the phrase <em>To the one who overcomes</em> first in the clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will give to him who overcomes</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>To the one:</strong> Here the word <em>one</em> refers generally to any believer who overcomes evil. Use a pronoun or grammar that is similar to what you used in the statement “He who has an ear” in 2:7a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>overcomes:</strong> This word means “triumphs” or “obtains/wins victory.” Here it refers to having success over sin, evil, and pressure to turn away from Jesus. Even though a believer is killed, he wins the victory over evil if he remains faithful to Jesus. He <em>overcomes</em> the power of sin and evil. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>conquers (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>is victorious (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages must say what a believer <em>overcomes</em>. If that is true in your language, you should refer generally to “evil” or “sin.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>defeat <span data-bnType=\"implied\">evil</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>has victory <span data-bnType=\"implied\">over sin</span></p></blockquote><h4>2:7d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:7d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I will grant the right to eat from the tree of life</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I will give permission to eat from the tree of life,</p></li><li><p>I will give the privilege of eating <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the fruit of</span> the tree that gives life.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will grant the right to eat:</strong> The Greek clause is literally “I will give to eat.” The BSB translates “give” as <em>grant</em> and adds the phrase <em>the right</em> as one way to indicate the correct meaning of the Greek clause in English. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will give permission to eat (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will let…eat (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>from the tree of life:</strong> This phrase indicates that believers will eat <u>the fruit of</u> <em>the tree of life</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the fruit of the tree of life (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the tree of life:</strong> This phrase indicates that <em>the tree</em> is the source of <em>life</em>. Those who eat the fruit will have eternal life. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the tree that gives life</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the life-giving tree (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you have translated Genesis 2:9, see how you translated this phrase there.</p><h4>2:7e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:7e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in the Paradise of God.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>which is in the good place of God.</p></li><li><p>That tree is located in God’s perfect land/garden.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the Paradise of God:</strong> This clause tells the reader more about the tree of life. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other trees of life and only this one is located <em>in the Paradise of God</em>. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about the tree of life. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is in the paradise of God.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Paradise of God:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Paradise</em> can refer to an enclosed garden or park. It was also used to refer to a place where there are only good things, as in heaven (as in 2 Corinthians 12:2–3). Here this word refers to the New Jerusalem, where there will be only good and perfect things. This paradise is <em>of God</em> because it belongs to God and he rules over it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages do not have a word to express this meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:7c–e</strong></h5><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Translate the meaning of <em>Paradise</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s good place</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s land that is perfect</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the garden of God (REB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, you may want to explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The word “paradise” refers to a place where there are only good things. Here this word refers to the New Jerusalem (21:10, 22:2).</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is more natural to tell what Jesus will give before telling to whom he will give it. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7d</sup>I will give the privilege of eating from the tree of life, <sup>7e</sup>which stands in the paradise of God, <sup>7c</sup>to everyone who wins the victory. (GW)</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:7c–e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:7c–e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(reordered) I will give permission to eat from the tree of life, which is in the good place of God, to anyone who gains victory.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>(reordered) I will give permission to eat <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the fruit of</span> the tree that gives life to any of you<sup>(plur)</sup> who defeat/conquer <span data-bnType=\"implied\">everything that causes a believer to stumble</span>.

(2) Some early Greek manuscripts have the phrase <u>your deeds and afflictions</u> (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1), because the UBS Greek NT supports it.</span></span> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>affliction</em> means “oppression” or more generally “troubles.” Here the word probably refers to the fact that some people in Smyrna were persecuting the believers there.

It refers to the angel of the church as the representative of all the believers there. In many languages it is more natural to use plural pronouns here. See how you translated the pronoun “your” in 2:2.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>your poverty:</strong> The word <em>poverty</em> indicates that the believers in Smyrna were <u>very poor</u>. They had very little money or goods. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are poor (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are extremely/very poor</p></blockquote><h4>2:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>though you are rich!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but you are wealthy!</p></li><li><p>Yet you are <span data-bnType=\"implied\">spiritually</span> rich <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because of your great faith</span>!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>though you are rich:</strong> Here the word <em>rich</em> refers to having many spiritual blessings. The believers could look forward to these rewards in heaven. In the Gospels these rewards are often called “treasure.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>rich</em> here does <u>not</u> refer to earthly riches. Jesus used the word <em>rich</em> without explanation to contrast it with the word “poverty” in 2:9a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would only refer to earthly riches. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Explain the meaning in your translation.

Some people in Smyrna were telling lies to cause others to think that the believers were bad people. In some languages it is necessary or more natural to translate this word using a verb or verb phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>lies being told about you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the evil things said against you (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the bad things some people say about you (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>some people are slandering you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are slandered (REB)</p></blockquote><h4>2:9c–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those who falsely claim to be Jews, but are in fact a synagogue of Satan:</strong> The people referred to here were probably Jews by birth, but they did not believe in Jesus. Satan had influenced them so that they persecuted the believers at Smyrna. So in that way they were not Jews spiritually, because true Jews followed God’s commands. Jesus said that they were <em>a synagogue of Satan</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Jesus used this strong language to emphasize that these people were very wrong to follow Satan. Other ways to translate these words are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people who falsely claim to be Jews but are really members of the synagogue of Satan (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who claim to be Jews but are not; they are a group that belongs to Satan (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They say they are Jews, but they are not true Jews.

The word does not refer to the building where they met. The GNT therefore translates this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>group</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Satan:</strong> The word <em>Satan</em> is the Hebrew word used for the leader of all evil spirits. In Hebrew the word means “one who opposes others.” It is similar in meaning to “enemy” but does not necessarily imply hostility or hatred. It is used as a title in the New Testament. So you should spell this word in your language like the Greek or the major language word. If this word is not already known in your area, you may also want to add a descriptive phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Satan, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the one who opposes,</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Satan, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the one who stands against</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you have translated the Gospels, see how you translated this word in Matthew 4:10, Mark 1:13, Luke 10:18, or John 13:27.</p>",

The word emphasizes or calls attention to the words that follow.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you have a word with that meaning, you may want to use it here. Some examples are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Behold, (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Beware, (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Listen/Hey!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the devil:</strong> The Greek word that that the BSB translates as <em>devil</em> means “slanderer.” A slanderer is someone who says false things about someone to try to ruin that person’s reputation, name, or status. This word is used like a title for the leader of demons, Satan. Make it clear that this word is used like a title:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Devil (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this word are:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use a local name or idiom that refers to the chief of all demons. <em>You may want to explain the meaning of the Greek word in a footnote. An example footnote is:</em></p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Literally:“slanderer.” In Greek this was used as a title for the chief of all demons.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a descriptive phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>leader of the evil spirits</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>spirit enemy of God <em>You may want to explain the meaning of the Greek word in a footnote. An example footnote is:</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Literally: “slanderer.” In Greek this was used as a title for the chief of all demons.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate its meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Slanderer <em>You may then want to explain this title in a footnote. An example footnote is:</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The title “Slanderer” refers to the chief of demons.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, you may want to explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The word “Devil” means “slanderer” in Greek.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>is about to throw some of you into prison:</strong> This clause indicates that Satan would influence others to put some believers in prison. Satan would not physically put the believers in prison himself.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that Satan would physically put them there himself. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain the correct meaning in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">cause others to</span> put some of you in prison</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>prison:</strong> This word refers to a place where people are locked inside so they cannot leave. Another way to translate this word is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>jail (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to test you:</strong> Here the word <em>test</em> refers to examining someone’s faith to see if it is strong. The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>to test you</em> is literally “that you may be tested.” It is a passive clause. It does not say who would <em>test</em> the believers. In one sense, Satan would test the believers by tempting them to give up their faith. But in another sense, God was testing them to see if they believed strongly in him. Many English versions leave the subject ambiguous. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and you will be tested (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that you will experience/undergo testing</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>where your faith will be tested (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that it will become clear if you believe well/truly or not</p></blockquote><h4>2:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and you will suffer tribulation for ten days.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and you will suffer hardship for ten days.</p></li><li><p>For ten days you will experience trouble/oppression.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>suffer tribulation:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>suffer</em> is literally “have.” The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>tribulation</em> refers to “oppression” or more generally “troubles.” Here it probably refers to the suffering and testing of 2:10a–b. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>have tribulation (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>face hardship (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>experience suffering (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>suffer (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>2:10d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:10d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Be faithful even unto death,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Be faithful, even if you must die <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because of that</span>,</p></li><li><p>Continue to obey <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and trust</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">me</span>, even if others kill you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for believing</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in me</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Be faithful:</strong> This is a command to continue to follow Jesus Christ and to do what he says to do. In some languages it is more natural to say to whom the believers in Smyrna should be loyal. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Be faithful to me (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>even unto death:</strong> This phrase indicates that the believers must continue to follow Jesus even if others kill them because of it. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Even if you have to die (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>even though that might cause your death</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>even if others kill you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for believing/following me</span></p></blockquote><h4>2:10e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:10e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and I will give you the crown of life.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and I will give to you the crown that is life <span data-bnType=\"implied\">itself</span>.</p></li><li><p>and I will give you the wreath of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">victory, which represents eternal</span> life.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the crown of life:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>crown</em> is literally “wreath.” Here it means “reward.” This metaphor indicates that God will reward believers with <u>eternal life</u>. They will live forever with him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In ancient times, athletes who won a contest received a wreath of leaves to wear on their heads as a sign of victory. This was a great honor, and it was their reward for winning the contest.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In a similar way, God will honor those who are victorious by giving them eternal life. The BSB has translated the word meaning “wreath” as <em>crown</em> because in English a <em>crown</em> is more easily understood to be a symbol for victory.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this phrase are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate literally and explain it in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the crown that is life itself (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the wreath of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">victory, which represents eternal</span> life</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a metaphor which uses an object that is a sign of victory in your culture. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>badge/trophy of life <em>You may then want to explain the Greek phrase in a footnote. For example:</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Literally:“crown/wreath of life.”</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the reward of eternal life for your victory</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>life as your prize of victory (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“The crown/wreath of life” indicates that the believer who remains faithful to Jesus will be rewarded with eternal life. The crown/wreath is a symbol of that victory for remaining faithful.</p></blockquote></li></ul>",

Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the second death will not be able to hurt/harm those who overcome</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>The one who overcomes:</strong> The phrase <em>The one who overcomes</em> is emphasized in the Greek by being first in the clause. If you have a natural way in your language to emphasize this phrase, you may want to do so. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>As for he who conquers, he</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Regarding those who win the victory, they</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>overcomes:</strong> The word <em>overcomes</em> means “triumphs” or “obtains/wins victory.” Here the word refers to having success over sin, evil, and pressure to turn away from Jesus. He continues believing and following Jesus even though he might be killed for it. See how you translated a similar phrase (“To the one who overcomes”) in 2:7.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>not be harmed by the second death:</strong> This is a figure of speech that indicates that believers will not die the second death. In some languages it is not natural to say that death can <em>harm</em> or hurt someone. Instead, it is more natural to:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Use a different word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>not be touched by the second death</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>not be affected by the second death</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the noun <em>death</em> as a verb.

The first death is physical death.

(2) Some early Greek manuscripts have the words <u>know your deeds and where you live</u> (KJV only).

In some languages it is more natural to use plural pronouns here. See how you translated the pronoun “your” in 2:2 or 2:9.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>where the throne of Satan sits:</strong> This clause figuratively indicates that Satan ruled in Pergamum. The people of Pergamum did not directly follow Satan but followed other religions. They worshiped pagan gods and also the Roman emperor, Caesar. In that way they were in fact worshiping Satan and letting Satan rule their lives. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>where Satan is enthroned (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>where the throne of Satan is</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that Satan physically sat in Pergamum.

The GNT has no conjunction here. But there is some contrast between Satan having much authority in Pergamum and the believers continuing to be faithful to Jesus. So the NCV translates this conjunction as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You should connect 2:13a and 2:13b in the way that is most natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you have held fast to My name:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>held fast</em> literally refers to holding something. This clause indicates that the believers in Pergamum continued to be faithful to Jesus. They did not stop following him. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you continue to cling to my name (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you have remained loyal to me (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>2:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and have not denied your faith in Me,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You did not deny/disavow your faith in me,</p></li><li><p>You did not say <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to anyone</span> that you would no longer believe in me,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and have not denied your faith in Me:</strong> The word <em>denied</em> refers to disowning something or refusing to have anything to do with it. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You did not renounce your faith in me (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you did not abandon your faith in me (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You did not say that you would no longer believe in me</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your faith in Me:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>your faith in Me</em> is literally “the faith of me.” Here it refers to the believers’ faith in Jesus Christ. They believed him, trusted him, and were committed to following him. Another way to translate this phrase is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in me</span></p></blockquote><h4>2:13d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:13d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>even in the day when My faithful witness Antipas</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>even during the time of my faithful witness Antipas,</p></li><li><p>even in those <span data-bnType=\"implied\">earlier</span> days when Antipas faithfully proclaimed my message.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>even in the day when My faithful witness Antipas:</strong> Here the word <em>even</em> implies that persecution of believers during the life of Antipas was worse than at other times. At that time people persecuted the believers very much. However, the believers did not stop believing in Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in the day when:</strong> This phrase refers to the general time that Antipas was killed. It could refer to weeks or months before or after that time. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>during the time (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>My faithful witness:</strong> The Greek words here are literally “my witness, my faithful one” (as in the RSV). Antipas told others about Jesus as the Christ. He was faithful to Jesus when people persecuted him. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who proclaimed my message and was faithful to me</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who told others about me and remained loyal to me</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Antipas:</strong> Nothing else is known about this man named <em>Antipas</em>. He is mentioned only in this verse. He was not the same person as the <em>Antipas</em> mentioned in the Gospels.</p><h4>2:13e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:13e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>was killed among you, where Satan dwells.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>who was killed in your city, namely, where Satan lives.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They/People</span> killed him in your city where Satan influences many <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>was killed among you:</strong> The phrase <em>was killed</em> is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. These verses do not say who killed Antipas, so you should use a general word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they</span> killed</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> killed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause tells the reader more about Antipas. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that John was thinking of several men named Antipas and only this one <em>was killed among you</em>. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about Antipas. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He was killed.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>where Satan dwells:</strong> This clause has a similar meaning to “where the throne of Satan sits” in 2:13a. It indicates that Satan had much influence in Pergamum.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that Satan physically dwelt in Pergamum. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>where Satan influences/controls <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the people</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>where Satan has many <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> on his side <em>You may then want to include a footnote to indicate what the literal words say. An example footnote is:</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Literally: “where Satan lives.”</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This saying is symbolic. It indicates that Satan influenced the people in that area.</p></blockquote></li></ul>",

At this time, the people of Israel had left Egypt and were traveling to the land that God had promised them. <em>Balak</em> was afraid that the Israelites would destroy him and his people.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the manna that has been hidden away in heaven (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active clause. Probably Jesus or God hid the manna. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the manna that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has hidden</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>manna:</strong> The Greek word <em>manna</em> is the name of a food that God miraculously fed to the Israelites in the desert (Exodus 16). Manna was described as “thin flakes like frost” (Exodus 16:14). It was also described as “white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with honey” (Exodus 16:31).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages people may not realize that <em>manna</em> refers to a food. It is also possible that the word might be mistaken for a similar word in your language with a different meaning. If that is true in your language, you should indicate that it refers to a food. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">food called</span> manna</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the heavenly food</span> manna</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You may also want to give more information in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Manna is the name of a food that God miraculously gave to the Israelites in the desert. (See Exodus 16.)</p></blockquote><h4>2:17c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:17c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I will also give him a white stone inscribed with a new name,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I will also give to him a white stone/pebble that has a new name written on it,</p></li><li><p>I will also give to him a white stone/pebble with a new name <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that God wrote</span> on it.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a white stone:</strong> The word <em>stone</em> probably refers to a small stone that easily fits in someone’s hand. The phrase <em>a white stone</em> probably symbolically refers to receiving permission to enter heaven, like receiving a ticket or pass to an event. Many English versions translate this literally.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">You may want a footnote to explain the symbol. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This white stone probably refers to symbolically receiving permission to enter heaven, something like receiving a ticket/pass.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>inscribed with a new name:</strong> The clause <em>inscribed with a new name</em> is passive. Some languages must translate with an active clause or a phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>with a new name <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that I/God</span> wrote on it</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>with a new name on it</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you follow the second example, it should imply that someone wrote the name.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a new name:</strong> A name is already written on the stone when Jesus gives it to the believer. These verses do not say whose name it is. If possible, do not add any information about whose name it is. The new name is probably one that Jesus gives to the victorious believer. But the new name might be a new name of Jesus (3:12).</p><h4>2:17d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:17d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>known only to the one who receives it.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and this name is known only by the one/person who receives it.</p></li><li><p>No one knows this new name except the one who receives it.

Only the person receiving the stone will know the name on it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The BSB omits “that is” from the beginning of this clause, as is possible in English here. The Greek is more literally “no one knows except the one receiving it.” Some ways to translate it are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a passive clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a name that is known only to the person who receives it (GW)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that no one knows except the one who receives it (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul>",

Translate the clause <em>These are the words of</em> in a similar way to 2:1.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Jesus spoke these words about himself. He continues to speak in 2:19 with “I.” In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that Jesus was talking about someone else here. If that is true in your language, indicate that Jesus spoke about himself. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>These are my words, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I,</span> the Son of God. My eyes are like blazing fire and my feet are like burnished bronze.</p></blockquote><h4>2:18b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:18b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>These are the words of the Son of God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>This message is from the Son of God,</p></li><li><p>Here is the message from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">me,</span> the Son of God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Son of God:</strong> This phrase is a title for Jesus. This title was often used to refer to a savior who would be a descendant of King David. God would send this savior to rescue his people. This person was often referred to as the “Messiah” or “Christ.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The title <em>the Son of God</em> also indicates that Jesus has the same nature and character as God. The relationship between God the Father and Jesus, his Son, is similar in some ways to the relationship between human fathers and sons. God the Father does not have a physical body. He did not have a sexual relationship with Mary that resulted in her becoming pregnant and giving birth to Jesus. The Son of God existed eternally as the Son with his Father.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In areas where people do not understand the title <em>the Son of God</em> in this way, you may want to include a footnote that explains the correct meaning. Here is a suggested footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This title refers to Jesus. It indicates that Jesus has the same nature and character as God. It does not mean that God the Father had a sexual relationship with Mary that resulted in her becoming pregnant and giving birth to Jesus. Mary became pregnant with Jesus in a miraculous way by the Holy Spirit of God.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is natural to speak of a son as a “child” without specifying whether male or female. If that is true in your language, you may use a more general term, such as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Child of God<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A translation of the title “the Son of God” must include a familial term such as “son” or “child.” Translations such as “the man who is God,” “the divine man,” or “the God man” are not acceptable, since they do not retain familial language. Examples of acceptable translation options include “the Son who comes from God,” and “the divine/unique/eternal Son of God.”</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Other verses will usually make clear that Jesus was a male child. If you use a phrase such as “the male child of God,” be sure that it does not imply that God had another child who was female.</p><h4>2:18c–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>whose eyes are like a blazing fire and whose feet are like polished bronze:</strong> These clauses tell the reader more about the Son of God. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other Sons of God and, only this one had <em>eyes…like a blazing fire and…feet…like polished bronze</em>. If that is true in your language, translate these clauses so that they tell more about the Son of God. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>His eyes are like a blazing fire and his feet are like burnished bronze.</p></blockquote><h4>2:18c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:18c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>whose eyes are like a blazing fire</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>who has eyes like a fiery flame (NET)</p></li><li><p>His/My eyes are as <span data-bnType=\"implied\">bright</span> as flames</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>eyes are like a blazing fire:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>a blazing fire</em> is literally “a flame of fire” (as in the RSV).

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>eyes looked like flames of fire (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>eyes were/are as bright as fire</p></blockquote><h4>2:18d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:18d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and whose feet are like polished bronze.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and whose feet are like polished bronze.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">evil/idolatrous</span> woman Jezebel</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You may also want to explain who she was in a footnote.

Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who claims to be a prophetess (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who says she is a prophetess</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who makes the false claim that she speaks messages from God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause tells the reader more about the false teacher called Jezebel.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>She calls herself a prophetess.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>prophetess:</strong> The word <em>prophetess</em> means “female prophet.” A prophet is a person whom God uses to communicate with the people.

This word is not a command to look at something.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you have a word or phrase with that meaning, you may want to use it here. Some examples are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Look, (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Beware, (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Indeed/Hey,</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will cast her onto a bed of sickness:</strong> The Greek clause is literally “I am throwing her on a bed.” It is probably a Hebrew idiom that means “I will now cause her to become sick/ill.” The BSB adds the words <em>of sickness</em> in order to indicate this meaning. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will throw her on a sickbed (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will cause her to become so ill that she cannot get out of bed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would not have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, translate the meaning of the idiom. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will cause her <span data-bnType=\"implied\">body</span> to suffer</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I will cast:</strong> The Greek grammar here is the present tense.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>their (KJV) <em>(KJV, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1), because the UBS Greek NT 4 apparatus recommends it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase indicates that the people were acting the same as the woman. In some languages it is not possible to say that people must repent of someone else’s deeds. In some languages it is more natural to refer to doing the same things. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>repent and stop acting as she does</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><u>Issue 2—Meaning</u></p><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase indicates that if these people repented, then they would not have to suffer. If they stopped committing adultery and eating food sacrificed to idols, God would forgive them. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if they do not turn away from the wrongs she does (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>unless they repent and turn away from her evil deeds (NLT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:22b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The cause (2:22c) is stated after the consequence (2:22b).

This is why the BSB and some other English versions translate the Greek word here as <em>But</em>.

For example, the CEV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>what her followers call the “deep secrets of Satan.” <em>(GNT, NASB, KJV, NLT, CEV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It <u>refers to people in general</u>.

The phrase refers to secret knowledge or practices. It refers to the immoral practices described in 2:20d–e as well as other secrets not described here.</p><h4>2:24d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:24d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I will place no further burden upon you.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I will not put any other burden/load on you.</p></li><li><p>I will not add any command for you to obey.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will place no further burden upon you:</strong> This statement is probably what Jesus said (2:24a) to the believers who have not followed Jezebel. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But to the rest of you in Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching, who have not learned what some call the deep things of Satan, <u>to you I say, I do not lay upon you any other burden</u> (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now <u>I say to the rest of you</u> in Thyatira, to you who do not hold to her teaching and have not learned Satan’s so-called deep secrets, <u>‘I will not impose any other burden on you</u> (NIV2011)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>burden</em> refers figuratively to something that is difficult to do. This statement indicates that Jesus would not command the faithful believers to do anything else that was difficult. The several ways to translate this clause are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will not put any other load on you.

Lastly, he gave a promise for any believer who persevered in his faith.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Translate this heading as you did for the other messages to the churches.</p></div><h4>2:26–28</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">These verses contain promises that God will reward anyone who overcomes. Several English versions therefore use plural rather than singular forms throughout these verses: “To those who overcome….” If you use plural forms, you should remember that 2:27a–b contains a quotation from the Old Testament. At that time God spoke to one person, the king. You should not translate the quotation in a way that indicates that the original promise was addressed to many people.</p><h4>2:26a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:26a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And to the one who overcomes and continues in My work until the end,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ To anyone who gains victory and follows my commands to the end,</p></li><li><p>¶ To you<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believers</span> who defeat/conquer <span data-bnType=\"implied\">everything that causes a believer to stumble</span> and obey me to the end <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the age</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And to the one who overcomes and continues in My work until the end:</strong> These words are emphasized by being in front of the phrase “I will give” (2:26b). If you have a natural way in your language to emphasize these words, you may want to do so. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>To him who conquers and does the deeds I want him to do until the end, I will give</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>To those who win the victory I will give (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is not natural to emphasize these words in this way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will give to him who overcomes and does my will until the end</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>overcomes:</strong> The word <em>overcomes</em> means “triumphs” or “obtains/wins victory.” Here the word refers to having success over sin, evil, and pressure to turn away from Jesus. Translate this phrase as you did in 2:17.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>continues in My work:</strong> This phrase refers to doing the works/deeds that Jesus commands believers to do. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who obey me (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>follows my commands</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>until the end:</strong> This phrase probably has the same meaning as “until I come” in 2:25. It refers to the end of the present age, when Jesus returns. In some languages it is necessary to include the implied information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to the end <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the age</span></p></blockquote><h4>2:26b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:26b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I will give authority over the nations.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I will give power over the nations.</p></li><li><p>I will give the right to rule the nations.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will give authority over the nations:</strong> The word <em>authority</em> refers to the right and power to control or rule over someone or something. Jesus will enable faithful believers to rule the nations. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will give authority to rule the nations</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will cause them to rule over the nations</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the nations:</strong> The phrase <em>the nations</em> in the Old Testament refers to all non-Jewish peoples.

It can also refer to groups of people grouped by language or culture.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:26a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">2:26a states to whom the promise was made. 2:26b is the main part of the clause.

If that is true in your language, you may want to include some implied information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He will lead them with an iron scepter <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to their own destruction</span>; like dashing pottery to pieces</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">destructively</span> rule them with an iron scepter; like he would destroy pottery</p></blockquote><h4>2:27a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:27a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He will rule them with an iron scepter</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>‘He will rule them <span data-bnType=\"implied\">forcefully</span> with an iron staff/stick,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will be as the Scripture says:</span> ‘He will lead/govern them <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to their destruction</span> with a rod <span data-bnType=\"implied\">made</span> of iron,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He:</strong> Here the word <em>He</em> refers to believers who overcome and do his will to the end (2:26a). It does not refer to Jesus. Some English versions do not use <em>He</em> in 2:27a–b in order to make that clearer. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>26b</sup>I will give <u>them</u> authority over the nations, <sup>27a</sup><u>to rule</u> them with an iron rod <sup>27b</sup>and <u>to break</u> them to pieces like clay pots. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>iron:</strong> This word refers to the strongest known metal at that time. It could break most things without damage to itself. Some languages do not have a word for this metal. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use the major language word.</p></li><li><p>Describe it. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>made of very strong metal</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the strongest thing in your language.

Often a shepherd would use a stick of this kind to fight off wild animals. The word <em>scepter</em> refers to an ornamental stick that symbolizes the rule of a king. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>stick</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>rod/staff</p></blockquote><h4>2:27b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:27b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and shatter them like pottery</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>as when clay pots are shattered’— (NRSV)</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">he will destroy his enemies</span> as someone smashes/breaks pottery <span data-bnType=\"implied\">into many pieces</span>.’</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>shatter them like pottery:</strong> The Greek words are literally “as when clay pots are shattered” (as in the NRSV). When a clay pot breaks, it shatters into many pieces and becomes useless. This clause explains how believers will rule the nations with an iron rod. They will destroy their enemies. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as when pottery is broken into pieces (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>smashing them to pieces like earthenware (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation will not indicate the correct meaning of “being destroyed.” If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">he will completely destroy them like</span> when pottery is broken into pieces</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the metaphor.

Follow how the major language version places the verse number.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>—just as I have received authority from My Father:</strong> The words <em>just as</em> connect this clause to 2:26b. Jesus received authority to rule the nations from his Father. He will give that same authority to his followers. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They will have the same authority I received from my Father (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This is the same power I received from my Father (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>authority:</strong> Here the word <em>authority</em> refers to the right and power to control or rule over someone or something. You should translate this using the same word or phrase as in 2:26.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>My Father:</strong> This phrase refers to God. In some languages people will not clearly understand that the phrase <em>My Father</em> refers to God. If that is true in your language, you may want to add this implied information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>my Father <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>my <span data-bnType=\"implied\">heavenly</span> Father</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:26a–27c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">2:27c is closely connected to 2:26b. In some languages it is more natural to put 2:27c before 2:27a–b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>26a</sup>To him who overcomes and does my will to the end, <sup>26b</sup>I will give <span data-bnType=\"implied\">him/them</span> authority over the nations,<sup>27c</sup>just as I have received <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that</span> authority from my Father. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">As the Scripture says:</span> <sup>27a</sup>‘He will rule them with an iron rod, <sup>27b</sup>as when clay pots are shattered.’</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>26a</sup>To those who win the victory, who continue to the end to do what I want, <sup>27c</sup>I will give the same authority that I received from my Father: <sup>26b</sup>I will give them authority over the nations, <sup>27a</sup>to rule them with an iron rod <sup>27b</sup>and to break them to pieces like clay pots.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>These are my words, and I hold the seven spirits of God and the seven stars.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the One who holds:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>holds</em> also means “has.” Here the word indicates that Jesus in some way possessed or controlled the seven spirits and the seven stars. Translate using a word with that meaning.

This pronoun refers to the angel of the church as the representative of all the believers there. In many languages it is more natural to use plural pronouns here and in the following verses to refer to the believers directly.

Some ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that (KJV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>how (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The BSB and some English versions end 3:1d with a semi-colon (;) to indicate that there is a connection and allow the context to imply that 3:1e explains 3:1d. Other English versions end 3:1d with a period and allow the context to imply that 3:1e explains 3:1d.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you have a reputation for being alive:</strong> The word <em>reputation</em> refers to what people thought and said about the believers in Sardis. The people thought that the faith of these believers was <em>alive</em>.

The word <em>dead</em> refers figuratively to following Jesus very poorly. People thought that the believers in Sardis followed Jesus well. But in fact the believers did not. They did not behave according to what they said they believed. They were like dead people, who cannot even move their bodies.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages people will think that this saying refers to only physical life and death. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Explain the meaning in your translation.

They should have love, faith, service, and perseverance. The believers in Sardis did not love very much or believe very much or serve very much or persevere very much.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>was about to die</em> indicates that their small amount of love, faith, service, and perseverance was becoming even less. The command to <em>strengthen</em> indicates that they should increase their love, faith, service, and perseverance.

This clause figuratively represents the idea that he has the authority that the key represents. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who <u>has</u> the key of David (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the key of David:</strong> This phrase is a metaphor. The word <em>key</em> refers to authority. As King David had authority over the kingdom of God’s people, so Jesus also has authority over the kingdom. Jesus fulfills the prophecies that God gave about David’s descendant and heir. Jesus has the right to rule as that descendant.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would not have the figurative meaning of authority. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Explain the symbolic meaning in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the key of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">authority over</span> David’s <span data-bnType=\"implied\">kingdom</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the key of David, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">namely, authority over his kingdom</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the symbol.

An example footnote is:</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Literally: “the key of David.” This phrase refers to authority to rule.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate literally and explain the Greek words in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The “key of David” refers to authority to rule God’s kingdom. God promised to David that his descendant would rule over that kingdom.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>David:</strong> David was the second king of Israel. He lived about a thousand years before Revelation was written. He was faithful to God, and God promised him that someone from his family would reign forever (2 Samuel 7:16, Isaiah 9:6–7).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it will be helpful to say that David was the king of Israel, God’s people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">King</span> David</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>David <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the former/ancient king of Israel</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">King</span> David <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who ruled God’s people</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">long ago</span></p></blockquote><h4>3:7d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:7d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>What He opens no one can shut, and what He shuts no one can open.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>who opens and no one will shut, who shuts and no one opens.

He has full authority. Once he decides something, no one can change that decision. The NRSV follows the Greek word order and Greek grammar:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>who</u> opens and no one will shut, <u>who</u> shuts and no one opens</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">As in the above example, the Greek words are not a new sentence here. But in some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here, as the BSB does.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>opens…shuts:</strong> These verses do not say what Jesus opens and shuts. The word “doors” is probably implied, as in 3:8b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to include the implied information in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When he opens a door, no one can close it. And when he closes it, no one can open it. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The words of 3:7d refers figuratively to authority. It probably refers specifically to the authority to let people enter through the door. Jesus makes all decisions about who can enter the kingdom of God’s people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer only to opening and closing physical doors. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Explain the meaning in your translation.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I have placed a road before you that no one can block</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I have given to you an opportunity that no one can thwart/frustrate</p></blockquote><h4>3:8c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:8c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For you have only a little strength,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I know that you have little ability <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to serve me</span>,</p></li><li><p>I also know that you have little power <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to do things for God</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you have only a little strength:</strong> Here this phrase probably refers to the fact that this was a small church. It was not strong in numbers, wealth, or influence in society. The people of this church were, therefore, not able to do much for Jesus. This phrase does <u>not</u> imply that they were sinning. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are not very strong (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are weak <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in what you able to do</span></p></blockquote><h4>3:8d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:8d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>yet you have kept My word and have not denied My name.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but have followed my teachings and not disowned/rejected me.</p></li><li><p>but have obeyed my commandments and not denied that you are my followers.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>have kept My word:</strong> The word <em>kept</em> here means “followed” or “obeyed.” The believers in Philadelphia had obeyed Jesus’ commands and teachings. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>have followed my teaching (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>have kept my commandments (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>have not denied My name:</strong> This clause indicates that the believers in Philadelphia had not rejected Jesus. They had openly declared that they followed him. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>did not deny me (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>did not deny that you are my followers (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>have not disowned me</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>have been faithful/loyal to me</p></blockquote>",

He prophesied that they would have an opportunity to do great things for him. He said that the Jews there would acknowledge that God loves the believers.

This word calls attention to, or emphasizes, the words that follow it. This word is not a command to look at something. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Behold (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Listen! (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Indeed/Hey</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those who belong to the synagogue of Satan:</strong> Here the word <em>synagogue</em> refers to the group of misled Jews in Philadelphia. The word does not refer to the building where they met. So the GNT translates this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that group that belongs to Satan</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated the phrase <em>synagogue of Satan</em> in 2:9.</p><h4>3:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who claim to be Jews but are liars instead.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>those who falsely claim to be <span data-bnType=\"implied\">true</span> Jews but are liars.</p></li><li><p>(they claim as Jews <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be the true people of God</span> but <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they</span> lie).</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who claim to be Jews but are liars instead:</strong> These clauses explain the phrase “synagogue of Satan.” These Jews claimed to be the true people of God. But they rejected Jesus as the Christ, so they were lying about being God’s people. Other ways to translate these clauses are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those who falsely claim to be Jews, but are liars (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those liars who say they are Jews but are not (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that John was thinking of other synagogues of Satan, and only this group claimed <em>to be Jews but are liars instead</em>. If that is true in your language, translate these clauses so that they tell more about the synagogue of Satan here. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They claim to be God’s people, but they are liars. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you do this, you will need to put this information either at the beginning or the end of the verse. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>9a</sup>A synagogue of Satan exists there. <sup>9b</sup>They claim to be Jews though they are not, but are liars. <sup>9c</sup>I will make them come and fall down at your feet <sup>9d</sup>and acknowledge that I have loved you.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>9a</sup>I will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan <sup>9c</sup>come and fall down at your feet <sup>9d</sup>and acknowledge that I have loved you. <sup>9b</sup>They claim to be Jews though they are not, but are liars.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>who claim to be Jews but:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>but</em> is literally “and” (or sometimes “but”). Here there is contrast between <em>who claim to be Jews</em> and the clause “are liars instead.” But in English two uses of “but” this near to each other is not natural. Other ways to translate these words are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who claim to be Jews and are not, but (NABRE)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who claim to be Jews but they are not, for</p></blockquote><h4>3:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I will make them come and bow down at your feet,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Look, I will cause them to come and prostrate themselves at your feet</p></li><li><p>Indeed/Hey, I will make them go to you and bow down before you,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will make them come:</strong> 3:9c begins with the Greek word that means “look.” This word calls attention to, or emphasizes, the words that follow. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>look, I will make them come</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>indeed/hey, I will make them come</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural not to repeat the word that you used at the beginning of 3:9a. If that is true in your language, it will be better to not translate it here, as the BSB has done.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word may also be used to indicate that the explanation (3:9b) is finished. Jesus then continued talking about what he will do to them. See note at 3:9b about reordering the clauses in this verse.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I will make them come:</strong> This indicates that Jesus would cause these false Jews to honor those who believed in Jesus. In some languages it is more natural to indicate where they would come. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will make them come <u>before you</u> (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>bow down at your feet:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>bow down</em> refers here to kneeling and putting the face to the ground with arms outstretched toward someone. This position showed complete humility before that person and honored him. This is the usual way to show someone honor at that time and in that region. Translate these words in a way that indicates that someone is honoring someone else. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>prostrate themselves at your feet</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>kneel with their face to the ground before you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>bow down at your feet (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages have a different action that shows complete humility and honor to someone. If that is true in your language, you may want to use that action here.</p><h4>3:9d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:9d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and they will know that I love you.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and know/realize that I love you.</p></li><li><p>and they will recognize that I love you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>know:</strong> The group called “the synagogue of Satan” would realize that God loves the believers. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>realize (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>learn (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>acknowledge (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I love you:</strong> The Greek grammar here refers generally to Jesus loving believers. It indicates that Jesus loved them in the past and continues to love them in the present. In your translation, indicate that Jesus loved the believers at all times. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I love you (BSB, GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>love:</strong> The word <em>love</em> refers to a strong feeling of affection and concern for a person.</p>",

However, the phrase <em>have kept</em> (3:10a) means “obeyed” and the phrase <em>will…keep</em> (3:10b) means “will protect.” The same Greek verb is used to emphasize the reason-result connection between the two clauses.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages need to use different verbs in order to indicate the correct meaning in both clauses. If that is true in your language, you may want to emphasize the reason-result connection in some other way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Since you have obeyed my command to endure patiently, <u>indeed</u>, I will protect you during the time/hour of trial</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You obeyed my message and endured. <u>So</u> I will protect you from the time of trouble that everyone in all the world must go through.

In some languages it is more natural to introduce 3:10b as a result. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10a</sup>You have kept my command to endure patiently, <sup>10b</sup><u>so</u> I will also keep…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you have kept My command to persevere:</strong> The believers in Philadelphia had continued to follow Jesus faithfully in spite of suffering. Jesus had commanded them to do that. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you have obeyed my command to persevere</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You have obeyed my teaching about not giving up your faith (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>command:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>command</em> is literally “word.” This word may refer to a command given in a prophecy to the believers in Philadelphia. Or it may refer to a command that Jesus gave during his lifetime to all believers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>persevere:</strong> The Greek word here is the same word that is translated as “perseverance” in 2:19b. Jesus wanted the believers to continue to follow him faithfully even though they suffered because of it. See how you translated this Greek word in 2:19 or 2:2.</p><h4>3:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I will also keep you from the hour of testing</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>therefore I will keep you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">safe</span> from the time of testing</p></li><li><p>so I will bring you out of the ordeal</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will also keep you from the hour of testing:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>from</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>from</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will keep you from the hour of trial (RSV) <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NASB, NLT, CEV, NET, REB, NCV, ESV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>during</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will keep you safe in the time of trial (NJB) <em>(NJB, NABRE, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because the Greek word means “out of,” and a different Greek word means “during.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Beale (page 289) has “from.”</span></span> See the note below for more information about the meaning of the word <em>from</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I will also keep you from:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>from</em> refers to removing something from something else. Here Jesus will remove the believers in Philadelphia from the hour of trial. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will remove you out of</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will also keep you safe from (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>keep you:</strong> Here the word <em>keep</em> refers to Jesus protecting his followers in some way. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>protect you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>preserve you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the hour of testing:</strong> This phrase refers to a time of hardship. It is a time when people will suffer greatly. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the time of trouble (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the great time of testing (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the ordeal (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>hour:</strong> The word <em>hour</em> refers figuratively to a specific period of time. But here is not clear if it is hours, days, months, or years. Use a word or phrase that allows that general meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>testing:</strong> This word can mean “testing” or “trial” or “hardship.” God will test people with hardship to see if they will obey or trust him. You may want to see how you translated this word in 2:10 (“to test”), Luke 8:13, or James 1:2, or refer to the notes there.</p><h4>3:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that is about to come upon the whole world,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>which will occur everywhere</p></li><li><p>that people all over the world will experience.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that is about to come upon the whole world:</strong> The Greek words are literally “that will happen to everyone in the world.” Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that will come to the whole world (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that is to fall upon the whole world (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>come upon the whole world:</strong> Here the phrase <em>come upon</em> means “happen to.” All the words here indicate that the whole world will experience something difficult. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>occur in all the world</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that the whole world will experience</p></blockquote><h4>3:10d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:10d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to test those who dwell on the earth.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>in order to test those who dwell upon the earth.</p></li><li><p>Indeed, all people on this earth will go though that ordeal.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to test those who dwell on the earth:</strong> This clause indicates the purpose of “the hour of testing” mentioned in 3:10b. Its purpose is to <em>test</em> people, to see if they really obey or trust God. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>indeed, to test/try those living on the earth</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in order to test all those on this earth</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages explaining the purpose of the test is more natural. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to test <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the faith of</span> those who live on the earth</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>test:</strong> The Greek word here has the same basic meaning as “testing” in 3:10b. The Greek word here is a verb, but the Greek word in 3:10b is a noun. See the examples above.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:10a–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek and the BSB, this verse is one long sentence.

Jesus will cause/make this person to become like a pillar. If you have a natural way in your language to emphasize the phrase <em>The one who overcomes</em>, you may want to do so. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He who conquers, I will make him (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is not natural to have the phrase <em>The one who overcomes</em> first in the clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will make him who overcomes</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>The one who overcomes:</strong> The word <em>overcomes</em> means “triumphs” or “obtains/wins victory.” Translate this phrase as you translated it in 3:5. Notice that the word <em>one</em> is the object, not the subject, of the main verb “make.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a pillar in the temple of My God:</strong> This phrase probably refers symbolically to being in the presence of God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would not have the correct meaning.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other new Jerusalems and only this one comes <em>out of heaven</em>. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about the new Jerusalem. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is coming down out of heaven from my God.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>comes:</strong> The BSB, like the Greek, uses the present tense here. This present tense refers generally to the fact that at some time the city will descend. Revelation 21 describes the new Jerusalem descending to the new earth <u>after</u> God judges all people (Rev 20).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to use the future tense here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will come (GNT)</p></blockquote>",

It is probably comparing the Laodiceans and their deeds to water. In their culture, <em>hot</em> water was useful for certain activities (such as bathing), and <em>cold</em> water was useful for other activities (such as drinking). But the believers in Laodicea were not like the <em>hot</em> water or the <em>cold</em> water. They were not useful for anything.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Aune, Beale, Smalley, Johnson, and Osbourne support this interpretation of “cold,” “hot,” and “lukewarm.” Beale (page 303) says, “‘Neither cold nor hot” but “lukewarm” has traditionally be understood to be metaphorical of their lack of spiritual fervor and halfhearted commitment to Christ. One problem with this is that Christ’s desire that they be either ‘cold or hot’ implies that both extremes are positive. …But it is unlikely that Christ would commend that extreme of complete disloyalty.” Aune (page 257) says, “‘lukewarm’…is a metaphor for barrenness or ineffectiveness.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is necessary to make the implied comparison with water explicit.

In some languages it is more natural to make that contrast explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Connect this verse to the previous verse in the way that is most natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold:</strong> This verse continues the figurative use of “cold” and “hot” of 3:15b–c.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>since you are like lukewarm water, neither hot nor cold (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold:</strong> The word <em>lukewarm</em> refers to the middle temperature between hot and cold.

If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Allow the context to indicate the middle temperature and do not translate the word <em>lukewarm</em>.

It refers to Jesus rejecting the believers because of their laziness. Jesus rejecting them is like expelling lukewarm water because it tastes bad.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would not indicate the correct meaning.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The BSB and some other English versions allow the context to imply the connection and do not translate the Greek conjunction here. Introduce the reason clause in 3:17a in the way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You say, ‘I am rich; I have grown wealthy…’:</strong> As in all the letters to the churches (2:1–3:22), Jesus spoke here to the angel of the church. The angel represented the believers of the church.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to address the believers directly. If that is true in your language, use plural pronouns here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You(plur) say, ‘We(incl) are rich; we have acquired wealth…’</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>You say:</strong> Here the believers were probably saying these things to themselves. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You say to yourself (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I am rich; I have grown wealthy:</strong> In the Greek, the first clause uses the noun “rich” and the second clause uses the verb “become rich.” Together, the two clauses emphasize that the Laodiceans were very rich. Other ways to translate these clauses are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I am rich and have acquired great wealth (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I am rich, I have made a fortune (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>need nothing:</strong> The believers in Laodicea felt like they lacked nothing that they needed for daily living. They had everything. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>do not need a thing (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>have all I need (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>3:17b–18e</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">These sentences use physical conditions symbolically to describe spiritual conditions. The English versions translate the sentences literally rather than explaining what the symbols mean.

They were like <em>wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked</em> people because they were not trusting and obeying God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is necessary to indicate that Jesus was speaking symbolically. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">spiritually</span> you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>your <span data-bnType=\"implied\">faith is lacking like someone who is</span> wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believe so little that you are like someone</span> wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>wretched:</strong> This word refers to being in an awful and undesirable condition. The GNT translates it as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>miserable</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>pitiful:</strong> This word refers to someone whom others feel sorry for because of all of his difficulties and troubles. Here the word indicates that others should feel sorry for the believers in Laodicea because of these problems in their faith. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>pitiable (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>pathetic</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>poor:</strong> This word refers to someone who lacks money and other material things. Spiritually, it describes someone who does not possess God’s spiritual blessings and riches. The believers in Laodicea had a lot of money and possessions, but they were “poor” in their faith.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>blind:</strong> Someone who is physically <em>blind</em> is unable to see physical things. Someone who is spiritually blind is unable to understand spiritual things.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>naked:</strong> This word refers to someone who is not wearing any clothes at all.

The GNT translates the Greek word as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>advise</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>buy from Me gold refined by fire:</strong> This command symbolically refers to obtaining true, spiritual riches from God. The believers in Laodicea needed to ask Jesus for the only kind of wealth that is truly valuable. See the General Comment at the end of 3:18e.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>gold:</strong> The word <em>gold</em> refers to a rare metal of a somewhat yellow color. It was the most expensive metal at that time. Gold is naturally shiny and beautiful.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages people are not familiar with <em>gold</em>. If that is true in your language, you may want to describe it. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">expensive</span> gold</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">valuable</span> metal/stones <span data-bnType=\"implied\">called</span> gold</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated a similar word (“golden”) in 1:12.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>refined by fire:</strong> When someone makes gold so hot that it melts, the impurities in the gold float to the top. Then the impurities can be removed. In that way gold is made pure, or it is <em>refined</em>. The verb <em>refined</em> is an implied passive clause. Some ways to translate it are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a passive clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It has been refined in a fire, (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>gold made pure in fire (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active clause.

The Greek language does not need to repeat it here. However, in some languages it is more natural to repeat some or all of the main clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">buy from me</span> white clothes to wear</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I counsel you to buy from me</span> white clothes to wear</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>white garments</em> probably refers figuratively to righteousness or goodness. Moral goodness (or righteousness) is sometimes symbolized by white clothes in the Bible.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer only to their literal clothing. If that is true in your language, you may want to include the implied meaning in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>white clothes <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that represent righteousness/purity</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to help readers understand this figurative speech is to translate literally but explain that meaning in a footnote.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so…your shameful nakedness will not be exposed (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and the shame of your nakedness may not be seen (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so you will not be shamed by your nakedness (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active clause.

Nakedness is a symbol for their lack of righteousness. White clothing is a symbol for righteousness. They needed to remedy their lack of righteousness (their “nakedness”). Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>be shamed by your nakedness (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the shame of being naked</p></blockquote><h4>3:18e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:18e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and salve to anoint your eyes so that you may see.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and ointment to rub on your eyes so you can see.</p></li><li><p>And <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I advise/instruct you to buy from me</span> salve to put on your eyes, so that you can see <span data-bnType=\"implied\">spiritual things</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and salve to anoint your eyes so that you may see:</strong> The third thing Jesus told the believers in Laodicea to accept from him was eye <em>salve</em>. He wanted to give them true sight, that is, spiritual understanding.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer only to literal salve. If that is true in your language, you may want to include the implied meaning in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and salve <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that represents the healing power of God to see spiritual needs</span> to put on your eyes, so you can see</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>salve:</strong> This word refers to an ointment put on the eyes to help heal eye diseases. Here the salve would heal the spiritual blindness mentioned in 3:17b. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>ointment (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>medicine</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to anoint your eyes:</strong> Translate this phrase by using the natural way to talk about applying medicine to eyes.

The faith of the believers at Laodicea was wretched and pitiful. They were spiritually poor, blind, and naked.

The physical remedies represent spiritual blessings like pure faith, knowledge of God, and righteousness.</p></blockquote></div>",

He wants to renew or continue the relationship he has with them.</p><h4>3:20a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:20a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Behold, I stand at the door and knock.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Look/Indeed, I have been standing at the door and knocking.</p></li><li><p>Indeed/Hey, I am standing at the door, requesting entrance.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Behold:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Behold</em> is literally “look.” The word emphasizes or calls attention to the words that follow. The word is not a command to look at something. Other ways to translate this Greek word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Indeed/Hey,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Look,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Listen!

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am standing at the door, knocking (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>knock:</strong> Here the word <em>knock</em> means “request entrance.” Jesus wanted to enter their home. As 3:20b indicates, Jesus also calls to the person inside.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to include the implied action here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>knock <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and call/speak</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If the word <em>knock</em> has a different meaning than “request entrance” in your language, you should use the word or phrase in your language that means “request entrance.”</p><h4>3:20b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:20b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>If anyone hears My voice and opens the door,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>If anyone hears me and opens the door,</p></li><li><p>When one <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of you</span> hears me calling and opens the door <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to me</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>If anyone hears My voice:</strong> This clause implies that Jesus spoke loud enough so that the person inside the house could hear him.

But Jesus was still speaking to those who were spiritually poor, blind, and naked. In some languages it is more natural to continue using second person here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If any <u>of you</u> hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with <u>you</u>, and <u>you</u> with me</p></blockquote></div>",

The word “look” is not a command to look at something. Other ways to translate the Greek phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>indeed/hey,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>suddenly/unexpectedly</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a throne:</strong> A <em>throne</em> is the official chair where a king sits. From his throne, he rules his people and his country. Therefore, the word <em>throne</em> is a symbol for the authority the king has to rule. This <em>throne</em> is God’s throne, because he rules heaven.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 1:4.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in heaven:</strong> Here the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>heaven</em> refers to the place where God lives. Some languages do not have a word for this place. If that is true in your language, you may need to:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use a word that can refer figuratively to the place where God lives. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>sky</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the place beyond the stars</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the major language word. If people from your language are not familiar with the meaning of this word, you may want to include a footnote to explain it:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Heaven is the place where God lives.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate it using a descriptive phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the place where God lives</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with someone seated on it:</strong> Here the word <em>someone</em> is general, but it refers to God. By not naming God, this phrase emphasizes that the person sitting on the throne has all the authority that the main throne in heaven symbolizes. John may also be copying the style of the Old Testament prophets in not naming God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer to someone other than God. If that is true in your language, translate in a way that clearly refers to God. If possible, speak indirectly of God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>with the one <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who rules everything</span> sitting on it</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>with the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">great/greatest</span> One sitting there</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">But in some languages speaking indirectly about God will still be unclear. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate literally and put in a footnote to explain the meaning. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This refers to God.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The word “someone” refers to God here.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Speak directly about God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>with <u>God</u> himself sitting on it</p></blockquote></li></ul>",

This <em>lightning</em> often occurs during a thunderstorm. Another way to translate this phrase is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>lightnings (KJV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and rumblings:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>rumblings</em> has several possible meanings. There are three ways to interpret it:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to <u>the “rolling” sound of thunder and probably also the wind</u>. (The next phrase, “peals of thunder,” refers to loud crashes of thunder.)

A <em>sea</em> is a large body of water that is many kilometers wide. The <em>sea</em> that John saw may have been solid like glass or liquid like water. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>there is something like a sea of glass (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>something resembling a sea of glass</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>something spread out like a sea of glass</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a sea of glass:</strong> The sea could be made <em>of glass</em>.

In that way it looked smooth and clear like glass.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as clear as crystal:</strong> The Greek words only indicate that the sea of glass was “like crystal” (as in the RSV). The comparison to <em>crystal</em> probably indicates that John could see through the sea in the way that someone can see through <em>clear</em> water. So the BSB and some other English versions add the word <em>clear</em>. But “as crystal” may instead refer to it being shiny or flat or angled (rather than rounded).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>crystal:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>crystal</em> refers to various substances that are bright, shiny, and have flat surfaces.

Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>venerate</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>revere</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If possible, refer to your translation of this word in Matthew 2:2, Luke 4:8, or 1 Corinthians 14:25.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:10a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The phrase “fall down before the One seated on the throne” (4:10a) refers to worshiping God. The phrase “worship Him who lives for ever and ever” (4:10b) also refers to worshiping God. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly imply or indicate that these two phrases refer to worshiping two different people. If that is true in your language, you may want to combine the two phrases into one phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the twenty-four elders fall down before <u>the forever-living one who sits on the throne,</u> and they worship him</p></blockquote></div><h4>4:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>They cast their crowns before the throne, saying:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They place their crowns before the throne and say,</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">take off</span> their headpieces/hats of authority to place them before the throne.

In some languages it is more natural to connect 4:10c to their worship. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>and</u> threw down their crowns in front of the throne, saying (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10b</sup>worship him who lives forever and ever, <sup>10c</sup><u>laying</u> their crowns before the throne and saying</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>crowns:</strong> The <em>crowns</em> of the elders are a symbol of leadership, just like the <em>crowns</em> of kings. Translate this word as you did in 4:4.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>saying:</strong> They probably all spoke in unison. So, as in 4:8c, you may want to translate this word as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>say <span data-bnType=\"implied\">together</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>chant</p></blockquote>",

In some languages it will be more natural to translate it as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Listen</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Look (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>See (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Lion of the tribe of Judah:</strong> This phrase is a title for the Christ. In Genesis 49:9–10, Jacob prophesied that Judah would be like a lion. Jacob also said that one day all nations would obey the person with this title. Therefore, the Jews used this title for the Christ. Jesus is that descendant of Judah. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lion from Judah’s tribe (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the one titled The Lion Who Descended From Judah</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Lion:</strong> A lion is a large, fierce, four-legged animal. It weighs about 200 kilograms (450 pounds) and is about 2 meters (6.5 feet) in length. See how you translated this word in 4:7.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>tribe:</strong> Here the word <em>tribe</em> refers to one of the twelve groups in the nation of Israel. The groups were founded by the twelve sons of the man named Jacob, or Israel. The name “Israel” is the name for the nation of the Jews. Another way to translate this word is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>clan</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Root of David:</strong> Here the word <em>Root</em> probably refers to a new shoot that grows from the root of a plant after the main plant has been cut off. This phrase combines the thoughts in Isaiah 11:1 and 11:10. For example, the REB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the shoot growing from David’s stock</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It refers to the promised leader of God’s people who descended from King David. He was David’s heir. In some languages the meaning of <em>the Root of David</em> will not be clear. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Translate the meaning without the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">special/unique</span> Descendant of David</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">promised</span> Heir of David</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the one who renews/restores David’s kingship</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This phrase combines the thoughts in Isaiah 11:1 and 11:10. It indicates that one who could open the scroll was the promised leader of God’s people who descended from King David. <em>But if your word for “shoot” refers to ancestors, you should translate as in the first option above.</em></p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>has triumphed:</strong> This phrase refers to winning a victory over enemies. Jesus followed God’s plan to redeem mankind by dying on a cross for their sins. By that act, Jesus defeated sin and death. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>has won the victory (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>has conquered (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>has surpassed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">These verses do not say over which enemies Jesus triumphed. It is best not to add this information. But in some languages it is necessary to say over what Jesus triumphed. If that is true in your language, use a phrase that can refer generally to what he triumphed over. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>has triumphed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">over all things</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>has prevailed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">over all his enemies</span></p></blockquote><h4>5:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to open the scroll and its seven seals.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He can <span data-bnType=\"implied\">break</span> the scroll’s seven seals and open it.”</p></li><li><p>He is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">worthy to</span> remove its seven wax stamps and open/unroll the scroll.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to open the scroll and its seven seals:</strong> The Greek clause indicates that 5:5c is the result of 5:5b. Jesus conquered his enemies, and that deed showed that he had the authority to open the scroll. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals. (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>thus he can open the scroll and its seven seals. (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It is implied here that Jesus is worthy to open the scroll. In some languages this implied information must be explicit for the correct meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">worthy and</span> able to open the scroll and its seven seals</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He is worthy to open the scroll and its seven seals</p></blockquote>",

Jewish people killed a lamb at the Passover as a sacrifice to God. The lamb has symbolic meaning as a special sacrifice and is a symbol for the Christ. Jesus was killed at Passover, and he died as a sacrifice to God. Many English versions capitalize the word <em>Lamb</em> here to indicate it is used as a title.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages readers would not clearly understand a literal translation of this word as a title. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain in a footnote that it is a title for Jesus as the Christ. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This word is a symbolic title for Jesus.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it will be helpful to explain the title in a footnote. Example footnotes are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This word is a symbolic title for Jesus. It indicates that he was like the lambs that the Jewish people sacrificed to God at every Passover feast. Like those lambs, he died at Passover as a sacrifice to God.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This title indicates that Jesus was like the lambs that the Jewish people sacrificed to God at every Passover feast. Like those lambs, he died at Passover as a sacrifice to God.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages people are not familiar with sheep and lambs, so you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a young <span data-bnType=\"implied\">tame animal called</span> a sheep</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Passover sacrifice animal</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The word “Lamb” refers to the young of an animal called a sheep.

It probably implies that the Lamb still had the marks that showed that he had been killed. Perhaps it had wounds or scars. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>looked as if it had once been killed (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>appeared to have been killed (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>have been slain:</strong> This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">they</span> had killed it/him</p></blockquote><h4>5:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>standing in the center of the throne,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>standing near the throne</p></li><li><p>He was standing beside the place/seat of ruling,</p></li></ul></div><h4>5:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>encircled by the four living creatures and the elders.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>with the four living beings and the elders around him.</p></li><li><p>and the four living beings, and the elders surrounded them all.</p></li></ul></div><h4>5:6b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>standing in the center of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the elders:</strong> The Greek words are literally “standing in the middle/midst of the throne and the four living creatures, and in the middle/midst of the elders.” The words probably indicate that the Lamb was standing very near the throne. The four living creatures stood around the throne and the Lamb. The elders then surrounded the Lamb, the throne, and the four living creatures. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>near the throne, and the four living creatures were there also, and the elders surrounded them all</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">These clauses do not mean that the Lamb was “on” the throne or “at” the throne. The Lamb comes to the throne in 5:7.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>throne:</strong> This word refers to the official chair of a king or leader. The word <em>throne</em> is a symbol for authority to rule. See how you translated this word in 4:4.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the four living creatures:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>living creatures</em> is literally “living (ones).” The word refers to beings that are like angels yet symbolically look like animals (4:7). See how you translated this phrase in 4:6.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the elders:</strong> Here the word <em>elders</em> refers to those who have authority. These twenty-four people (or angels) were leaders. They had God as their leader. See how you translated this word in 4:4.</p><h4>5:6d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:6d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The Lamb had seven horns and seven eyes,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He/It, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the Lamb,</span> had seven horns and seven eyes,</p></li><li><p>The Lamb had seven horns and seven eyes.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>seven horns:</strong> Here the word <em>horns</em> refers to the horns on an animal’s head. Horns are a symbol of strength.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would not imply the symbolic meaning of the horns. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Horns are a symbol of strength.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>seven horns <span data-bnType=\"implied\">symbolizing his great power</span></p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>seven:</strong> The number <em>seven</em> is symbolic of completeness or perfection. The fact that the Lamb had seven horns indicated that its power was perfect, just like God’s power is perfect.</p><h4>5:6e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:6e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>which represent the seven Spirits of God sent out into all the earth.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>which are the seven spirits of God sent by him into every part of the earth.</p></li><li><p>The <span data-bnType=\"implied\">seven</span> eyes represent/symbolize the sevenfold Spirit of God. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> sent them into the whole world.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>which represent the seven Spirits of God sent out into all the earth:</strong> This clause tells the reader more about the seven eyes of 5:6d. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other groups of seven eyes and only this one is <em>the seven Spirits of God</em>. If that is true in your language, translate these words so that they tell more about the seven eyes of 5:6d. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>These are the seven spirits of God sent by him into all the earth.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>His seven eyes mean the Seven Spirits of God that he commands to go to the whole world.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the seven Spirits of God sent out:</strong> The clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the seven spirits of God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that he</span> sent</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the seven Spirits of God:</strong> Many scholars believe that the phrase <em>the seven Spirits</em> is a symbolic reference to the Holy Spirit. Other scholars believe that the phrase refers to seven angels or to seven other spirits who serve God. See how you translated this phrase in 1:4 or 4:5.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>into all the earth:</strong> This phrase indicates that God sent the Holy Spirit all over the whole earth.

Beale, Smalley, Aune, Swete, and Lenski say it is only the elders here. Some argue that the masculine form of “each” in the Greek requires it only refer to the elders since “creatures” in Greek in neuter. But in mixed groups including male participants (i.e., men and women) the masculine form is always used. The living creatures participate in worship in other places of this vision, so it seems best to include them here.</span></span> Many English versions do not try to make it clear whether this word refers to both groups or just the elders. For example, the NJB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>each one of them</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some scholars think this refers only to the elders. For example, the REB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Each of the elders</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>harp:</strong> A harp is a stringed instrument which is used to make music. There were several types of harps. Two examples are:</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If harps are not known in your area, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a descriptive phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>stringed musical instrument <span data-bnType=\"implied\">called a harp</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote.

They were probably shaped like bowls used in eating. But you should not refer to them as “soup dishes” or anything else referring to food.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>golden:</strong> The word <em>golden</em> indicates that the bowls were made of gold. Gold is a rare metal of a somewhat yellow color. It was the most expensive metal known at that time. It is naturally shiny and beautiful. See how you translated this word in 1:12.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>incense:</strong> The word <em>incense</em> refers to the dried sap of certain kinds of trees. The dried sap burns slowly to make a sweet-smelling smoke. Incense is often used as a part of worship.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages people are not familiar with <em>incense</em>. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Explain the word in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">special tree</span> resin/sap <span data-bnType=\"implied\">called incense</span> burned to give/release a sweet smell</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>sweet smelling <span data-bnType=\"implied\">tree</span> resin/sap <span data-bnType=\"implied\">called incense</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the major language word.

The clause indicates that the incense in each bowl is a symbol for <em>the prayers of the saints</em>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Beale (pages 357–358) explains well why only the incense represents the prayers. Also see Revelation 8:3–4.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Be sure to translate this in such a way that it is clear that John is informing his readers what these bowls represent. He is not distinguishing them from other bowls by saying in what way they differ. If it would be helpful in your language, translate these words so that they tell more about the incense. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The incense in the bowls was the prayers of the saints.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it will be necessary to indicate explicitly that the incense is a symbol. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>which are <span data-bnType=\"implied\">symbolically</span> the prayers of the saints</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The incense represents the prayers of the saints</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the saints:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>saints</em> means “holy ones.” The word does <u>not</u> refer to a small group of believers who were extremely godly. Here the word refers to all believers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s people (GNT)</p></blockquote>",

The word <em>tribe</em> applies to each of the four groups. In some languages it is more natural to repeat it for each group. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>from every tribe, every language, every people, and every nation</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>from all tribes, from all languages, from all places and from all kingdoms<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Yakan Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>tribe:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>tribe</em> can refer to a whole people group. It can also refer to a subgroup within the people group, like the English word “clan” does.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>tongue:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>tongue</em> here refers to all of the people who speak a certain language. In some languages it is more natural to refer to the people directly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people speaking every different language</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>people:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>people</em> here refers to a large group of people. But it is sometimes used to refer to a whole country, which may have many people groups in it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>nation:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>nation</em> here refers to a group of people who share a common culture. But it is sometimes used to refer to a whole country, which may have many people groups in it. It is similar in meaning to “people” above, but here it probably refers to a group of people under one government.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:9e</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is more natural to list these groups in a different order.

All four words are used to emphasize that Jesus will purchase people from all over the world for God. Some languages do not have three similar words like “tribe,” “people,” and “nation.” If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use fewer words.

He was like a lamb that had been killed. John also described those who worshiped the lamb.

They probably all spoke in unison. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They proclaimed with loud voices (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>loudly chanting (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>saying <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in unison</span> with loud voices</p></blockquote><h4>5:12b–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">5:12b–d is an exclamation of praise. It is like a song or poem. You may want to translate it like a song or poem.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The angels sang about Jesus using the third person (“he, him”). But Jesus was there (5:8). In some languages it is more natural to use second person (“you”). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lamb, you were slain and you are worthy to receive…</p></blockquote><h4>5:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“The Lamb, who was killed, indeed deserves</p></li><li><p>“Worthy is the Lamb! <span data-bnType=\"implied\">They/People</span> killed him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">but he is alive</span>!</p></li><li><p>The Lamb, you were killed. You are worthy</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Worthy is the Lamb:</strong> See how you translated the word <em>Worthy</em> in 5:9. Here the word <em>Worthy</em> is emphasized in the Greek and the BSB. If possible, emphasize the word <em>Worthy</em> naturally in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lamb is <u>indeed</u> worthy</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who was slain:</strong> This clause tells the reader more about the Lamb. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other people with the title “Lamb,” and only this one <em>was slain</em>. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about the Lamb. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He was slain.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. In this verse, the exact people who killed Jesus is not important. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they/people</span> killed</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They/People</span> killed him</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated the similar clause “to have been slain” in 5:6.</p><h4>5:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to be given might and riches and wisdom and power</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He is worthy</span> to have ability and wealth and wisdom and strength</p></li><li><p>to have power and wealth and wisdom</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength:</strong> The Lamb is worthy to have <em>power and riches and wisdom and strength</em>. This phrase is similar to 4:11b where the elders said that God was worthy “to receive glory and honor and power.” Some languages are able to translate in a similar way here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people/everyone</span> to praise your power and wealth and wisdom and strength</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that we acknowledge your power and wealth and wisdom and strength</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all beings</span> praise your power and wealth and wisdom and strength</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>power…strength:</strong> The Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>power</em> and <em>strength</em> are similar. They both refer to power, force, and strength. The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>power</em> also can refer to ability.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Both words are probably used here to emphasize God’s power. If possible, use two different words for the meaning of “power,” “strength,” “might,” or “ability.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, there is only one word that means both <em>power</em> and <em>strength</em>. If that is true in your language, either translate the first as “ability,” or use just the one word for a total of three things in this list. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to receive ability and wealth and wisdom and strength</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to receive power and wealth and wisdom</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>wisdom:</strong> The word <em>wisdom</em> means “be able to understand events and know what should be done.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to translate <em>wisdom</em> as a phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wise words and actions</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>right and just thinking</p></blockquote><h4>5:12d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:12d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and honor and glory and blessing!”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and honor and glory/majesty and praise!”</p></li><li><p>and to be honored and glorified and praised!”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and honor and glory and blessing:</strong> These words continue the list that started in 5:12c. The words <em>honor</em> and <em>glory</em> are used in a similar way in 4:11. See how you translated those words there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Lamb is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">also</span> worthy for everyone to honor, glorify, and praise him!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>blessing:</strong> The Greek word the BSB translates as <em>blessing</em> can also be translated as “praise.” It refers to speaking good words about someone or honoring him. The Lamb is worthy of everyone’s blessing/praise.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to translate this noun as a verb. See the above example.</p>",

Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>say in a voice that sounded like thunder (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>say with a thunderous voice (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>speaking with a noise like that of thunder</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to compare the action of speaking (rather than the voice) to thunder. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>say/speak as loudly as thunder roars</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>thunder/roar</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>say:</strong> The living creature spoke to the rider on the white horse (6:2). He did not speak to John. But you should <u>not</u> add “to the rider on the white horse” here, because John did not see the rider and horse until after the living creature spoke.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to translate the word <em>say</em> with a word that indicates loudness or intensity. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>shout (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>call out (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Come!:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is a textual issue in 6:1c: (1) Some early Greek manuscripts have the word <u>come</u> (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2) Some early Greek manuscripts have the words <u>come and see</u> (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1), because the UBS Greek NT recommends it.</span></span> This command was given to the rider in 6:2, whom John has not yet seen or who has not yet appeared.

It also probably indicates surprise, unexpectedness, or suddenness. Other ways to translate these clauses are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And I looked, and behold, a white horse. (NKJV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I looked, and before my eyes was a white horse (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I looked up, and suddenly/hey I saw a white horse</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then there appeared before me a white horse!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>saw a white horse, and its rider held a bow:</strong> The Greek words are literally “a white horse and one sitting on it having a bow.” It indicates that John saw both the <em>horse</em> and the <em>rider</em> at the same time but described the horse first. These verses also indicate that the <em>rider</em> held a bow when John saw him. Other ways to translate these Greek phrases are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>was a white horse and rider with a bow</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>was someone on a white horse and holding a bow</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>horse:</strong> A <em>horse</em> is a large, four-legged animal that weighs 500 kilograms (1100 pounds) or more. Horses are about 1.5 meters (5 feet) high at the back. People often use horses for transportation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages people are not familiar with horses. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Explain the word in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>riding animal <span data-bnType=\"implied\">called a horse</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A horse is a large animal that a person can ride. The person could direct the horse to go where he wanted.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>rider:</strong> The Greek word does not say whether the <em>rider</em> was a human being, an angel, or another being. You should translate <em>rider</em> in a way that allows for any being. See the examples above.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a bow:</strong> A <em>bow</em> is a weapon which is used to shoot arrows. The rider may have been only carrying the bow and not shooting an arrow. But it is probably implied that he had arrows as well.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages people are not familiar with bows. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Explain what the <em>bow</em> is in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">a war weapon called</span> a bow</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a general word or phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a war weapon</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Explain it in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A “bow” is a war weapon.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A “bow” is a weapon used in war. It is a long piece of wood bent and tied with a string. A straight reed/stick with a sharpened front end is called an “arrow” and is fitted to the string and the string pulled back, creating spring tension. When the warrior releases the string, the arrow shoots forward.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Explain it in a footnote together with an illustration. Include an illustration that shows a bow and arrow being used. You could put the illustration in your glossary, if you did not want to include one in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A “bow” is a weapon used in war. See illustration on this page.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A “bow” is a weapon used in war. See illustration in glossary.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a traditional war weapon common in your area. But you should not use a name of a modern weapon such as “gun.” You may then want a footnote to explain the literal word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Literally: “bow.” It is a long piece of wood bent and tied with a string. The warrior uses it to shoot sharp sticks called arrows at the enemy.</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>6:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And he was given a crown,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He was given a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">victory</span> wreath,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Someone</span> gave this rider a crown <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of victory</span>,</p></li><li><p>He received a crown <span data-bnType=\"implied\">showing he would be victorious</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he was given a crown:</strong> This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active or intransitive clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Someone/They</span> gave a crown to him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> gave a crown to him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he received a crown</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages the words “take” and “receive” are translated by the same verb. The English verb “receive” implies that someone gave the crown, but the English verb “take” does not imply that. Your translation should imply or indicate that someone gave it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a crown:</strong> Here, the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>crown</em> probably refers to a wreath worn on the head as a sign of victory over something. Here, it symbolizes victories in war (6:2c). See how you translated this word in 2:10 or 4:4.</p><h4>6:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and he rode out to overcome and conquer.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and he went out/forth conquering and to conquer <span data-bnType=\"implied\">many people/nations</span>.</p></li><li><p>and he rode out in order to win many battles and gain the victory <span data-bnType=\"implied\">over many people/nations</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he rode out to overcome and conquer:</strong> The Greek words are literally “he went forth conquering and/even that he might conquer.” The clause emphasizes that the rider rode out to win battles, and he continuously won battles. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he went out conquering and to conquer <span data-bnType=\"implied\">many</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He rode out to win many battles and gain the victory (NLT)</p></blockquote>",

If that is true in your language, you may want to include the implied information here.

These verses imply something like <em>permission</em> or “authority.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>the authority</u> to take (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>take away peace from the earth:</strong> This phrase indicates that the rider will cause people to argue and fight against each other.

A “denarius” would also normally buy sixteen quarts of barley or more. Therefore, the words in 6:6b–c refer to a severe shortage of wheat and barley. They had become very expensive. But 6:6d prohibits any shortage of olive oil or wine. People used all these four foods daily to make their meals.</p><h4>6:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“A quart of wheat for a denarius,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“A liter/quart of wheat will cost a day’s wages,</p></li><li><p>“<span data-bnType=\"implied\">There will be a shortage so that</span> a whole day’s pay will buy only one day’s worth of wheat <span data-bnType=\"implied\">kernels/grain</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>A quart of wheat for a denarius:</strong> This clause has no verb. In some languages it is necessary to add a verb for good grammar. You should probably add a future verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A quart of wheat will cost you a whole day’s wages! (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>One quart of wheat <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will be sold</span> for a day’s pay!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>People will need a day’s wage <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to buy</span> one quart of wheat!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This price is about eight times more than normal. In some languages a literal translation would not clearly indicate that the price is very high. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain the high cost in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Wheat <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will be so expensive that</span> a day’s wage will purchase <span data-bnType=\"implied\">only</span> one quart of it <span data-bnType=\"implied\">instead of eight quarts</span>!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>One quart of wheat will cost <span data-bnType=\"implied\">much more than normal; it will cost</span> a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">whole</span> day’s wages!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>quart of wheat:</strong> The grain called <em>wheat</em> was the daily food of many people at that time in that region. The Greek word for <em>wheat</em> and the kind of Greek measure probably imply wheat kernels/seeds/grain.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDAG, L&amp;N, Lenski, Osbourne, and Kistemaker all refer to <em>grain </em>for the Greek word for <em>wheat</em>, rather than <em>flour</em>.</span></span> The wheat kernels could be eaten directly or ground into flour for bread.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">A <em>quart of wheat</em> would make enough bread for one person for one day. People in some languages do not normally eat wheat bread. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Use the daily food common to your area. This might be rice, corn, or some other kind of food. You may want to include a footnote to explain the literal word. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Literally: “wheat.” Wheat bread was the daily food of many people at that time.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Wheat was the daily food of many people at that time.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Wheat was the daily food in that place at that time. Bread is made from wheat. A quart/liter of wheat flour would make enough bread for one person for one day.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>quart:</strong> The Greek word here refers to a measurement that is about equal to a <em>quart</em> or a liter. In some languages people are more familiar with liters than quarts. If that is true in your language, you may want to use the word “liter” here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a denarius:</strong> At that time, one <em>denarius</em> paid the wage for one day of work by a laborer or farm worker. This was a low wage. Only poor people worked for one denarius a day.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The high prices on food indicates that people would have to work all day just to pay for enough food to eat that day. In your translation you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Follow the NIV and use the phrase “a day’s wages” or a similar phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the money earned from a whole day of working</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a day’s pay. <em>You may then want to explain the Greek word in a footnote. For example:</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Literally, “a denarius.” This was a Roman coin that a laborer or farm worker received for one day of work. It was a poor person’s wage.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a word for a day’s wage for a poor person. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a silver coin <em>You may then want to explain the Greek word in a footnote. For example:</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Literally, “a denarius.” This was a Roman coin that a laborer or farm worker received for one day of work.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Spell the Greek word as someone in your language would say it and explain its meaning in a footnote. If you have used the word “denarius” in the Gospels, you may want to use it here. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A denarius was a Roman coin that a laborer or farm worker received for one day of work.</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>6:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and three quarts of barley for a denarius,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and three liters/quarts of barley will cost a day’s wages,</p></li><li><p>or three day’s worth of barley <span data-bnType=\"implied\">seeds/grain</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>three quarts of barley for a denarius:</strong> The word <em>barley</em> refers to a cheaper grain than wheat. Poor people often bought <em>barley</em> instead of wheat. This price is about five times more than normal. Poor people in some languages do not normally eat barley bread. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:6b–c</strong></h5><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use the daily food common to poor people in your area. It should be a food different than the word you used in 6:6b. You may then want to include a footnote to explain the literal word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Literally: “barley.” Barley was the daily food of poor people at that time.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Explain <em>barley</em> in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“Barley” was the daily food of poor people at that time.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“Barley” was the daily food of poor people at that time. A low quality bread is made from barley. Three quarts/liters of barley was enough food for a small family for one day.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">These two statements about food prices are probably instructions to the black horse and rider. The horse and rider will cause a shortage of foods used for the main part of the meal such as wheat and barley. The shortage will cause the high prices. People in some languages will not see that the shortage causes the high prices. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Include some implied information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Cause a shortage so that</span> a quart of wheat costs a day’s wages and three quarts of barley costs a day’s wages</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The food shortage will be so severe that</span> a quart of wheat will cost a day’s wages and three quarts of barley will cost a day’s wages</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This verse refers to a shortage of food that people eat daily. So the prices are five to eight times higher than normal. But there will not be a shortage of other food items like cooking oil and wine.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">Also, the phrase “for a denarius” is repeated in 6:6c. In some languages it is more natural to omit the phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6b–c</sup>A loaf of wheat bread or three loaves of barley will cost a day’s pay. (NLT)</p></blockquote></div><h4>6:6d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:6d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and do not harm the oil and wine.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and/but do not harm the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">olive</span> oil and the wine!”</p></li><li><p>But do not ruin the oil <span data-bnType=\"implied\">used in cooking</span> or the wine.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and do not harm the oil and wine:</strong> The person speaking prohibited the horse and rider from causing a shortage of olive oil and wine.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Beale, Aune, and Swete support this interpretation of this clause.</span></span> Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but do not harm oil and wine! (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But don’t ruin the olive oil or the wine. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>oil:</strong> The word <em>oil</em> here refers to olive oil. The olive is the fruit of the olive tree. Olive oil is squeezed out of it. The <em>oil</em> was used as cooking oil and as fuel for lamps.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages people will think that the word refers to something other than cooking oil. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain its use in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>cooking oil</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>wine:</strong> Wine is made from the juice of a fruit called grapes. Grapes grow on a vine. People squeeze them and collect the juice. The juice is allowed to ferment, so <em>wine</em> is an alcoholic beverage.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">At that time people commonly drank wine with the evening meal. People in some languages are not familiar with <em>wine</em>. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>common beverage called wine</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>fermented grape juice</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>wine water <em>You may then want to explain its meaning in a footnote.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>over a fourth/quarter of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the people on</span> the earth</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>fourth:</strong> Here, this word means “one out of four.” For example, in a group of four thousand people, one thousand would die.

Here the word <em>sword</em> represents any weapon which someone uses to kill someone else. It is probably a symbol for war here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>power…to kill people using <u>wars</u> (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 6:4.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>famine:</strong> This word refers to an extreme shortage of food. During a famine, people die from hunger. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>by starvation (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>plague:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>plague</em> is literally “death.” Here, the Greek word probably refers to diseases or other things that kill a lot of people in many places. Other ways to translate it are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>pestilence (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>disease (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages do not have a general word such as <em>plague</em>. If that is true in your language, you may need to use a descriptive phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>things that cause much death</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the beasts of the earth:</strong> Here the word <em>beasts</em> refers to animals that attack and kill people. In some languages the word <em>beasts</em> already implies the phrase <em>of the earth</em>. If that is true in your language, you may want to omit that phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wild animals (GNT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:8d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek, as in the BSB, the first three items (sword, famine, plague) are singular, but they refer generally to one or more occurrences of each one.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>wars, famines, plagues, and the wild animals on the earth (GW)</p></blockquote></div>",

The opening of each of the first four seals revealed a rider and a horse who would cause a different kind of trouble for people on the earth. The opening of the fifth seal revealed all the people who had been killed because of their faith.

These believers had followed God even when doing so meant that others would kill them. In that way, they offered their lives to God as a sacrifice.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>under the altar:</strong> This phrase probably refers to at the base or bottom of the altar. See drawing below.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>altar:</strong> On earth, an <em>altar</em> is a platform on which people offer sacrifices or gifts to God. The animal sacrifices are cooked or burned there. Below is one artist’s idea of the appearance of the altar where the Jews offered animal sacrifices and gifts in front of the temple in Jerusalem.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">However the <em>altar</em> of this verse is in heaven in John’s vision. People do not offer animal or food sacrifices on it. But in some languages the usual translation of <em>altar</em> refers to sacrificing. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>burning-place<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Tagbanwa Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>bench of sacrificing<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Based on the Levatbura Lamasong (Notsi Madak) Back Translation, draft, Papua New Guinea.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>offering burning table<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The people of many languages will understand that this usual translation of <em>altar</em>, being in heaven, will be different than altars on earth and will not be an altar on which to offer animals. But in some languages the usual translation of <em>altar</em> will imply animal sacrifice in heaven. If that is true in your language, use a more general word or phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>gift-giving place</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>bench of gifts to God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>offering table</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>souls:</strong> This word refers to the essential part of a person. It is the part of him that does not die when his body dies. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>spirits</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The same word is used in Matthew 10:28 and Acts 2:27.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>those who had been slain:</strong> The Greek grammar indicates that these people were killed earlier, before John saw them. The clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">others</span> have slain</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>slain:</strong> Here, the word <em>slain</em> refers to someone killing these believers. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>killed (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>executed</p></blockquote><h4>6:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for the word of God and for the testimony they had upheld.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because of God’s message and the testimony which they possessed.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They killed them</span> because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they were faithful to</span> God’s word and to the message <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about Jesus</span> that they had received.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for the word of God and for the testimony they had upheld:</strong> This part of the verse explains why these believers had been killed. Unbelievers hated and killed them because they had spoken God’s <em>word</em> and kept <em>the testimony</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for the word of God:</strong> Here the phrase <em>the word of God</em> refers to what God said. It is the message from God to people. The believers believed this <em>word of God</em>. They probably also told it to others.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is necessary to explain what was done with <em>the word of God</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they believed</span> God’s message</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they followed</span> God’s word</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for the testimony they had upheld:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>upheld</em> means “kept,” “preserved,” or “possessed.” There are two ways to interpret it:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>kept, preserved, or possessed</u> here. Believers followed the testimony even though others persecuted them and killed them. They did not try to change it so that people would be happy with them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because they were faithful to…the message they had received (NCV) <em>(BSB, NIV, NASB, NCV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>give or tell</u> here. Believers told others about Jesus and his gospel even though people persecuted and killed them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for the testimony they had given (NRSV) <em>(GNT, NJB, NRSV, NABRE, GW, CEV, NET)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The English word (“borne/bore”) that the RSV, ESV, NABRE, and REB use is ambiguous. It could mean “carry as a burden while persecuted” or “carry in front for others to see.”</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because the Greek lexicons support it and not interpretation (2).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Beale (page 390) uses the phrase “committed themselves to.” Aune (page 403–406) uses “bore” and later “maintained.” Lenski (page 231) uses “had.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>testimony:</strong> The word <em>testimony</em> means “the words spoken about what one saw or heard.” Here it probably refers to what Jesus did while on earth and who he claimed to be: the Messiah and King of all kings. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>truth revealed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by Jesus</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>message <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about Jesus</span></p></blockquote>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>holy and true</u> Lord</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>holy:</strong> Here the word <em>holy</em> indicates that God is perfect and unique.

The BSB omits the conjunction and allows the context to imply its meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>there was a great earthquake:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is a textual issue in 6:12b: (1) Some early Greek manuscripts begin 6:12b with the word <u>and</u> (BSB, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, NCV). (2) One early Greek manuscript begin 6:12b with the words <u>and look</u> (RSV, KJV, ESV). It is recommended that you follow option (1), because the UBS Greek NT supports it.</span></span> The Greek clause is literally “a great earthquake occurred.” Another way to translate this clause is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The earth shook greatly/terribly</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>earthquake:</strong> The word <em>earthquake</em> refers to the ground shaking.</p><h4>6:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and the sun became black like sackcloth of goat hair,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>the sun became black like a hair sackcloth,</p></li><li><p>The sun became black like coarse cloth made of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">black</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">goat</span> hair.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>sackcloth of goat hair:</strong> The Greek phrase is literally “a hair sackcloth.” Sackcloth is a rough cloth. The threads of the cloth are thick and made of hair. So the simile probably refers to the rough texture and dark color of such a cloth. Use the word or phrase for a coarse cloth of this kind. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>coarse sackcloth (NJB)</p></blockquote><h4>6:12d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:12d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and the whole moon turned blood red,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>the whole moon became red as blood,</p></li><li><p>The entire moon turned the color of blood.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the whole moon turned blood red:</strong> The Greek clause is literally “the whole moon became as blood.” This clause probably indicates that the moon turned the deep red color of blood.

The opening of each of the first four seals revealed a rider and a horse who would cause a different kind of trouble for people on the earth.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the great day of Their wrath has come:</strong> The phrase <em>has come</em> indicates that the day on which the people spoke these words was <em>the great day of Their wrath</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is necessary or more natural to translate <em>has come</em> in a different way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the great day of their wrath is today</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It has become the great day of their wrath</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the great day:</strong> Here the word <em>great</em> indicates that the day is important or extraordinary. This day is a special day when God and Jesus will punish the unbelievers on the earth. To those people, this day will be extremely terrifying. So you should <u>not</u> use a word that implies they are happy about this day.

In many languages, winds come from the north, south, east, and west. Here, the idiom implies that the angels control the wind over the whole world. Some languages do not have an idiom that refers to four places that are as far away from each other as possible.

God gave them the power and authority to harm the entire earth.

It also probably indicates surprise or suddenness. The word “look” is not a command to look at something. Other ways to translate these words are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I looked again, and before my eyes appeared (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I looked, and suddenly/hey <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span> saw</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated these words in 6:2.</p><h4>7:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>a multitude too large to count,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>a huge crowd that no one could count,</p></li><li><p>so many people that no man or woman could count them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a multitude too large to count:</strong> The word <em>multitude</em> means “very big crowd.” This crowd is so large that John says it is <em>too large to count</em>. Use the word in your language for such a large crowd.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>too large to count:</strong> This clause indicates a very large number of people. God knew how many there were, but no man or woman could count them.

In some languages it is more natural to repeat it for each group. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>from every nation, every tribe, every people, and every language</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase naming the four groups is also in 5:9d. The order of the groups is different, but the meaning is the same. See how you translated this phrase in 5:9.</p><h4>7:9d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:9d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>standing before the throne and before the Lamb.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>standing before <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the one sitting on</span> the throne and before the Lamb.</p></li><li><p>They stood before the place/seat of ruling <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in heaven</span> and in front of the Lamb.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>standing before the throne:</strong> This phrase refers to standing before God. He is sitting on the throne. But John usually speaks indirectly about God, as in 4:2.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to refer to the person sitting on the throne. You should refer only indirectly to God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>standing before <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the one on</span> the throne</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>standing before <span data-bnType=\"implied\">him who sits on</span> the throne</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to refer to God here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>standing before <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God sitting on</span> the throne</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Lamb:</strong> This word refers to a young sheep. Here, the word is a symbolic title for Jesus Christ.

A robe also has loose sleeves covering the arms. See how you translated this word in 1:13 or 6:11.</p><h4>7:9f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:9f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and holding palm branches in their hands.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and held palm branches in their hands.</p></li><li><p>and held the branches of a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">tree named</span> palm in their hands <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as a symbol of joy and victory</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>palm branches:</strong> Palm trees have branches that all extend from the top of the trunk.

If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a general word referring to tree branches. You may then want to describe them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">flat</span> branches</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>branches of the palm tree</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a word for a similar tree with long, flat branches.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, you may want to explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Palm trees have branches that all extend from the top of the trunk. The leaves are long and flat.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You may want to include an illustration.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">To the Jewish people <em>palm branches</em> are symbolic of joy and victory (as in Leviticus 23:40 and John 12:13). In many languages a literal translation would not imply this symbolic meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Explain the symbolic meaning in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>palm branches <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as a symbol of joy and victory</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Explain the symbolic meaning in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Palm branches were a symbol of joy and victory.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a symbol of rejoicing or victory in your language. Do not use a symbol that has incorrect connections to spirits and such things. You may then want to explain the literal word in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Literally: “palm branches.” In Jewish culture, palm branches were a symbol of joy and victory.</p></blockquote></li></ul>",

They strongly desired to praise God and Jesus. Another way to translate this clause is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they shouted (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek grammar probably indicates that they shouted the words of 7:10b–d repeatedly.

If possible, do not say what people are saved from.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to translate <em>Salvation</em> using a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Our God has the power to save</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Our God has made the way to save us!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is necessary to say whom God saves.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who rules as king <span data-bnType=\"implied\">over everything</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause tells the reader more about God. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other gods and, only this one sits on the throne. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about God. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He sits on the throne <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as king</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>throne:</strong> See how you translated this word at 3:21 or 4:9.</p><h4>7:10d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:10d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and to the Lamb!”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">salvation</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">also comes</span> from the Lamb!”</p></li><li><p>And the Lamb is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">also the one who is</span> able to save <span data-bnType=\"implied\">us</span>!”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and to the Lamb:</strong> Here, this phrase indicates that salvation also belongs to the Lamb.

There is no verb in the Greek. The BSB and many other English versions add the verb <em>be</em>. This phrase indicates that the angels agreed that God had praise and glory and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and strength. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>our God has all praise and glory and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and strength</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Praise, glory, wisdom, thanks, honor, power, and strength belong to our God forever and ever!

Praise, glory, wisdom,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Amen:</strong> The word <em>Amen</em> is a Hebrew word that means “even so” or “it is true.” It is used to agree with what was said. The Greek borrowed the Hebrew word. English borrowed this word as well. See how you translated this word in 1:6 or 5:14.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Blessing:</strong> This word refers to speaking words to honor someone. In some languages it is more natural to translate this noun as a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We praise you, our God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>May our God be blessed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>glory:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>glory</em> refers to greatness, power, splendor, and majesty. In some languages it is more natural to translate this as a verb or adjective. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we glorify our God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Our God is glorious/great/majestic</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 4:9 or 5:12.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>wisdom:</strong> The word <em>wisdom</em> means “be able to understand events and know what should be done.” See how you translated this word in 5:12.</p><h4>7:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and thanks and honor and power and strength</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and thanks and honor and might and power</p></li><li><p>thanksgiving, reverence, ability, and strength</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>honor:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>honor</em> means “respect, reverence.” See how you translated it in 5:12.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>power and strength:</strong> The Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>power</em> and <em>strength</em> both refer to power, force, and strength. The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>power</em> can also refer to ability. If possible, use two words related to “power,” “strength,” “might,” or “ability” here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to use verbs or adjectives. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Our God is strong and mighty</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>How powerful is our God!

It causes someone to think about what the answer might be. The elder knew the answer to this question and he also knew that John did not know the answer. He asked John this question to cause John to think about the people in white robes. Since John replied, you should translate these words as a question.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>These in white robes…who are they…?:</strong> The words <em>These in white robes</em> are emphasized in the Greek and the BSB by being first in the clause. Some languages will not be able to emphasize those words in that way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who are these in white robes…?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If possible emphasize the words <em>These in white robes</em> in another way.

The BSB and many other English versions use the more general word <em>Sir</em>. But in English “my” is not natural before <em>Sir</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you know:</strong> This phrase indicates that John expected the elder to tell him what he knew. This rhetorical statement is a polite request that the elder tell him who they are. John probably did not know or did not want to guess. The pronoun <em>you</em> is emphasized in the Greek. You may need to include some implied information to indicate that John expected a reply.

They experienced all or part of the suffering of that time. The phrase <em>come out</em> also indicates that <em>the great tribulation</em> no longer affects them. They now stand before God and Jesus (7:9). Other ways to translate these words are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They are those who have passed through the great ordeal (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>people who have ended their time in the great tribulation</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>believers who have finished experiencing/enduring the great tribulation</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>people who have been through the great trial (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the great tribulation:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>tribulation</em> means “distress,” “trouble,” or “oppression.” This phrase probably refers to the time just before Jesus returns. At that time God will send severe troubles upon the people of the earth. People will also severely persecute believers during that time. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the great ordeal (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the terrible suffering (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the great distress (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is necessary to translate the noun <em>tribulation</em> using a verb.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They will never hunger or thirst again (NJB)</p></blockquote><h4>7:16c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:16c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>nor will the sun beat down upon them,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The sun will not hurt/strike them,</p></li><li><p>The sun will not overcome them,</p></li></ul></div><h4>7:16d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:16d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>nor any scorching heat.’</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>nor will searing/roasting heat <span data-bnType=\"implied\">do so</span>.</p></li><li><p>and burning heat will not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">overcome them</span>.</p></li></ul></div><h4>7:16c–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>nor will the sun beat down upon them, nor any scorching heat:</strong> These two clauses have a similar meaning. Together they emphasize that the believers will not suffer from the hot sun anymore. John probably implies a complete lack of suffering or trouble here, but the English versions all translate the Greek literally. Other ways to translate these words are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Neither the sun nor any burning heat will ever overcome them (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>neither sun nor any scorching heat will burn them (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The sun will not hurt them, and no heat will burn them (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>nor any scorching heat:</strong> The phrase “will…beat down upon them” is implied from 7:16c. But it is not repeated here in the Greek or in the BSB. In some languages it is more natural to repeat some or all of that phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>nor will any scorching heat <span data-bnType=\"implied\">beat upon them</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>scorching heat:</strong> This phrase refers to heat that can burn. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>burning heat (GW)</p></blockquote>",

The Abyss is deeper in the earth, and this is the shaft that connects to it. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the shaft leading down to the Abyss (NJB) <em>(RSV, NIV, NJB, NABRE, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, REB, NCV, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>the pit is the Abyss</u>. The Abyss is a pit that has no bottom. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the bottomless pit (NASB) <em>(BSB, GNT, NASB, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because the word <em>Abyss</em> means more than a hole in the ground.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Beale (page 493), Aune (pages 525–526), Swete (page 115), Lenski (pages 287–288), and others support interpretation (1).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>(NIV:) shaft:</strong> This word refers to a very deep hole that goes straight down or goes in a mostly downward direction. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>downward tunnel/cave</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>hole</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Abyss:</strong> The word <em>Abyss</em> refers to a very deep pit or chasm. It indicates that the pit or chasm was too deep to measure. Here it probably refers to something underground rather than a chasm, since a shaft leads to it. Here the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Abyss</em> refers to an underground place where the spirits of dead people and demons lived. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>bottomless pit (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>hole deep beyond measure</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>cave/cavern leading to the place of the dead</p></blockquote>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>locusts came <u>out of the smoke</u></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>locusts:</strong> The Greek word used here refers to any kind of grasshopper. The <em>locust</em> is a kind of grasshopper that flies in swarms and eats all plants. Many English versions use the word <em>locusts</em> because of its harmful nature.

Many horses running together make a loud thudding and rumbling noise similar to “rolling” thunder. Chariots have wooden wheels, often with an outer ring of iron. These make much noise as they roll over the ground. The sound of the locusts’ wings was like the noise of the running horses pulling chariots. The sound continued for a long time. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the loud noise of many horses and chariots running into battle</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the loud rumbling of many horses and chariots going quickly to battle</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>many horses and chariots:</strong> The Greek phrase is literally “of-chariots of-horses of-many.” There are several ways to interpret this phrase. The main ones are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to <u>horses pulling chariots</u> and that there were <u>many of these horse chariots</u>. For example, the GNT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>many horse-drawn chariots <em>(RSV, GNT, NABRE, ESV, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It indicates that there were <u>many horses and also there were chariots</u>. For example, the BSB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>many horses and chariots <em>(BSB, NIV, REB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It indicates that there were <u>chariots and each chariot had many horses</u>. For example, the NJB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>chariots with many horses <em>(NJB, GW, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because there seems no reason from the Greek grammar to separate the horses from the chariots, as in interpretation (2). And it seems more likely that, for an example of a loud noise, <em>many</em> connects to <em>chariots with horses</em> and not just to <em>horses</em> (interpretation (3)). Other ways to translate this phrase according to interpretation (1) are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>many horse chariots</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>many chariots pulled by horses</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>many horses pulling many chariots</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>chariots:</strong> The word <em>chariot</em> refers to a vehicle with two wheels that is pulled by a horse or horses. The soldier stands in the vehicle. The wheels are made of wood and often have a band of iron around each wheel. The wheels make a rumbling noise when they roll.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages people are not familiar with <em>chariots</em>. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a descriptive phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">horse-drawn/pulled</span> war vehicles <em>But the word or phrase you use should not refer to modern military trucks or tanks.</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the major language word.

These <em>riders</em> may or may not have looked like people. Another way to translate this phrase is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the horses and those who sat on them</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in my vision:</strong> The Greek phrase is literally “the vision” (as in the NASB). The phrase refers to all that John has seen and written in this book. You may add the pronoun <em>my</em> if it is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>vision:</strong> Here the word <em>vision</em> refers to something that appears supernaturally. It is like a dream, but the person is usually awake. It is something or someone that people usually cannot see, but God causes them to see it.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>looked like this:</strong> This phrase indicates that the description of the horses and riders follows in 9:17b–d.</p><h4>9:17b–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">The breastplates have three colors. The colors are probably meant to match the three things that come out of their mouths. The fiery red color matches the color of fire. The dark blue color matches the color of the smoke. The sulfur yellow matches the color of sulfur.</p><h4>9:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The riders had breastplates the colors of fire, sapphire, and sulfur.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They wore coverings on their chests that had the colors of hot coal red, hyacinth/sapphire blue, and sulfur yellow</p></li><li><p>their breastplates had the colors of bright red, dark blue, and yellow.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The riders had breastplates:</strong> The Greek phrase the BSB translates as <em>The riders had breastplates</em> is literally “having breastplates.” The Greek does not indicate if it was the <em>riders</em> or the “horses” mentioned in 9:17a who wore breastplates. The phrase could refer to either:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>the riders,</p></li><li><p>both the riders and the horses.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">You should translate this phrase without saying who wore the <em>breastplates</em>. For example</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The breastplates were</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Their breastplates were (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>breastplates:</strong> The <em>breastplates</em> are formed by a thin sheet of metal or overlapping plates of metal shaped to fit over the chest to protect the wearers. See how you translated this word in 9:9.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the colors of fire:</strong> This refers to a bright red. It is similar in color to bright red coals of a fire.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>sapphire:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>sapphire</em> refers to a deep blue or purplish-blue color.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and sulfur:</strong> The word <em>sulfur</em> describes the color of pure <em>sulfur</em>, a medium yellow. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>sulfur–yellow (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages people are not familiar with <em>sulfur</em>. If that is true in your language, you may want to use the usual word for yellow in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>yellow</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>egg yolk yellow</p></blockquote><h4>9:17c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:17c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The heads of the horses were like the heads of lions,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The heads of the horses looked like the heads of lions,</p></li><li><p>Each horse looked like it had the head of a lion,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>like the heads of lions:</strong> The male lion has a mane of hair around his neck.

If possible, emphasize this phrase naturally in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to have this clause in its usual place. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>fire, smoke, and sulfur came <u>out of their mouths</u></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>out of their mouths:</strong> In 9:17c John described the heads of the horses. So the pronoun <em>their</em> probably refers to only the horses here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>smoke:</strong> The smoke was probably a dark blue color, matching the color on the breastplates. You may want to use a similar word or phrase for the color of the smoke here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">dark blue</span> smoke</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sulfur:</strong> The word <em>sulfur</em> refers to a yellow powder or soft solid. It is often found at hot springs and near volcanoes. When <em>sulfur</em> burns, it makes a poisonous, bad smelling gas.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages people are not familiar with <em>sulfur</em>. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use the major language word and add a descriptive word or phrase.

John described what the angel looked like. When the angel shouted, John heard seven beings speak with loud voices like thunder. God told John not to write what they said. The powerful angel announced that when the seventh angel blew his trumpet, God would finish his plan. Then God told John to eat the scroll that the angel held. He also told John that he would show him more future events.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>John saw an angel holding a small scroll</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Angel with the Little Scroll (NRSV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>10:6a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:6a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And he swore by Him who lives forever and ever,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He made an oath, calling on the name of the one who lives forever,</p></li><li><p>Then he asked the eternal One/God to support what he was about to say.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>swore by Him:</strong> The word <em>swore</em> refers to calling upon someone greater to be a witness that what the speaker was saying is true. It is implied that this other being will punish the speaker if what he said is not true. It does not indicate that the speaker is using bad or inappropriate words.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here the angel called on God to witness that his statement of 10:6e–7c was true. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>spoke a vow that his words are true according to him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>promised with an oath calling the name of him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>called for support for his words from him</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Him who lives forever and ever:</strong> This phrase refers to God. He lives eternally. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God who lives forever (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>forever and ever:</strong> The Greek phrase is literally “into the ages of the ages.” The word “age” refers to a very long time. So the phrase “the ages of the ages” refers to eternity. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the living one <u>of the timeless ages</u> (JBP)</p></blockquote><h4>10:6b–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who created heaven and everything in it, the earth and everything in it, and the sea and everything in it:</strong> This clause tells the reader more about God. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other gods that John was thinking of and only this one <em>created heaven</em> and all other things. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about the only true God. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He created the heavens and all that is in them, the earth and all that is in it, and the sea and all that is in it.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Also see the General Comment at 10:6e about reordering the information in this verse.</p><h4>10:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who created heaven and everything in it,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>who made the heavens and all that is in them,</p></li><li><p>For he/God created the sky and everything in it,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>created:</strong> This word means “made.” God made all these things from nothing. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>made (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>heaven and everything in it:</strong> The Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>heaven</em> and <em>it</em> are singular. But the phrase refers to the sky and everything in it, such as the stars, the moon, and the planets.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Beale (page 538) and Aune (page 565) say it refers to creation.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the skies and all that is in them (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the sky and space and all that is in those things</p></blockquote><h4>10:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the earth and everything in it,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>the world and all that is in it,</p></li><li><p>the earth and everything in it,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the earth and everything in it:</strong> This phrase refers to the world and all the animals and plants that live here.</p><h4>10:6d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:6d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and the sea and everything in it:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and the oceans and all that is in them,</p></li><li><p>and the sea and everything in it.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the sea and everything in it:</strong> This phrase refers to all the seas and oceans of the world.

This clause indicates that the final events are about to occur. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The time of waiting is over (NJB)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 10:6a–e</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">10:6a indicates that an angel made an oath. It also describes God. 10:6b–d also describes God. 10:6e then begins to tell what the angel said. His words was supported by his oath in 10:6a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to separate the description from the main event. If that is true in your language, you may want to translate this verse as more than one sentence. You may also want to reorder those sentences. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>6a</sup>And he swore by him who lives for ever and ever, <sup>6b</sup>who created the heavens and all that is in them, <sup>6c</sup>the earth and all that is in it, <sup>6d</sup>and the sea and all that is in it<u>.</u> <sup>6e</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Finishing the oath,</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the angel,</span> said, “There will be no more delay!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>6a</sup>And he made an oath, asking the eternal God to be a witness to what he said<u>.</u> <sup>6b</sup>God is the one who created the heavens and all that is in them<u>.</u> <sup>6c</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He created</span> the earth and all that is in it<u>.</u> <sup>6d</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He created</span> the sea and all that is in it<u>.</u> <sup>6e</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">After making that oath, the angel</span> said, “There will be no more delay!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>6a</sup>God lives for ever and ever. <sup>6b</sup>He created the heavens and all that is in them, <sup>6c</sup>the earth and all that is in it, <sup>6d</sup>and the sea and all that is in it<u>.</u> <sup>6a</sup>In the name of God, the angel made an oath <sup>6e</sup>and said, “There will be no more delay!</p></blockquote></div>",

If that is true in your language, you may want to use the name of a straight, thin stemmed plant that is not easily broken.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a long cane (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a staff:</strong> This refers to a straight stick that is used for measuring distances.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Come (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Listen</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The context implies that in the vision John would go from place to place in order to measure things.

At that time people measured the size of large things using a rod. A person moved the rod along the edge of an item consecutively from its beginning to its end.

Some English versions translate the Greek conjunction as “and.” Other English versions do not translate the conjunction and allow the context to imply this connection.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There is some contrast here with the ungodly people trampling the holy city. In some languages it is more natural to indicate this contrast. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will empower:</strong> The Greek word the BSB translates as <em>I will empower</em> is literally “I will give.” BSB supplies the word <em>empower</em> because the context implies either “power” or “authority” will be given. What the witnesses will be able to do is told in 11:3b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>grant authority (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>witnesses:</strong> The noun “witness” refers to a person who tells what he has seen, heard, or come to know. Here the <em>witnesses</em> tell others what God told them. The Greek word may refer to two men or to a man and a woman. It probably does not refer to two women. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>testifiers</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>people who speaks about what they knows</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those who report/explain</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 1:5 or 3:14.</p><h4>11:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and they will prophesy for one thousand, two hundred and sixty days.

These messages are called “prophecies” and reveal things that God wants people to know at that time. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>speak God’s message</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>proclaim God’s revelation</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 10:11.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>1,260:</strong> The Greek phrase uses number words: “one-thousand two-hundred sixty.” There are several ways to translate this meaning:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use number words. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>one thousand two hundred sixty</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>one thousand and/plus two hundred and/plus sixty</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use numerals as the BSB does.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use number words or phrase for “thousand” and “hundred” from the major language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>one tausen two handet six tens</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>one tausen and two handets and six tens</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>clothed in sackcloth:</strong> The word <em>sackcloth</em> refers to a rough cloth. The threads of the cloth are thick and made of hair. People often wore clothing made of <em>sackcloth</em> when they mourned someone who died.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages people are not familiar with <em>sackcloth</em>. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain it in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wearing mourning clothes</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they will be dressed in rough cloth to show their sadness (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>dressed in clothing of rough cloth <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as a sign of grief</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word at 6:12.</p>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When (BSB, GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>testimony:</strong> The word <em>testimony</em> means “the words spoken about what one saw or heard.” The word <em>testimony</em> is often used when the person speaking is expected to be truthful and accurate (as in a court of law). Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>witnessing (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>message that God told them <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to say</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages translate this word using a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the truth/message revealed to them</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>proclaiming God’s message</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 6:9. But, in particular, it refers to the words that God had given them to say, which John called prophesying in 11:3, 6. Your translation should at least imply that.</p><h4>11:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the beast that comes up from the Abyss will wage war with them,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">demon named</span> Beast that comes up from the bottomless pit will attack them,</p></li><li><p>the monster that comes up from the very/immeasurably deep hole <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that is the home of demons and the dead</span> will attack them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>beast:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>beast</em> refers to any animal, often a wild animal. The BSB uses the word <em>beast</em> to imply that this being is fierce, dangerous, or evil. Here the word refers to Satan or one of his servants, because they are fierce, dangerous, and evil.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would not clearly indicate the symbolic meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use a word that clearly refers to an evil creature or being. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>monster</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Explain the symbol in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The word “beast” refers to the devil or one of his servants.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">fierce/terrible</span> animal</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Abyss:</strong> The word <em>Abyss</em> refers to a very deep pit or chasm. The Greek word also refers to an underground place where the spirits of dead people and demons lived. It likely has that meaning here. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>bottomless pit (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>hole deep beyond measure</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>cave/cavern leading to the place of the dead</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 9:1.</p><h4>11:7c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:7c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and will overpower and kill them.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>conquer/overwhelm them, and kill them.</p></li><li><p>He will gain control/victory over them and kill them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>overpower:</strong> This word indicates that the beast was successful in his attack against the two witnesses.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>main street (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the great city:</strong> This phrase refers to Jerusalem, or possibly Rome or all places where the people oppose God. John purposely did not name the city here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>great:</strong> The word <em>great</em> indicates that the city is an important or well-known city.

The people of Egypt oppressed God’s people (Exodus 3:7,9). God punished them for those sins. Perhaps at this time, the people of Jerusalem will be sinning greatly too. But John does not explain why the great city is called <em>Sodom and Egypt</em>.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It is figuratively called Sodom and Egypt.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>figuratively called:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>figuratively</em> means “spiritually.” It indicates that the great city is like Sodom and Egypt, perhaps in their bad thinking toward God.

(2) One early Greek manuscript have the pronoun <u>our</u> (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1), because the UBS Greek NT supports it.</span></span> This phrase tells the reader more about the “great city.” Translate it so that it tells more about the great city. Some languages must avoid using the word <em>where</em> to do so. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Their Lord was crucified there.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">John’s readers knew that Jesus was crucified at Jerusalem. But the “great city” might be symbolic of all people who are enemies of God. You may want to explain this in a footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Jesus was crucified at Jerusalem. But the “great city” may be symbolic of all people who are enemies of God.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>their Lord was also crucified:</strong> This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. The particular people who crucified Jesus is not important here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> crucified the Lord of those two witnesses</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>their:</strong> The pronoun <em>their</em> refers to the two witnesses, and not to the people of the great city.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Lord:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Lord</em> means “the one who has authority over (something),” or “owner.” Jesus is ruler over the two witnesses, so they always did what he told them.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>crucified:</strong> The word <em>crucified</em> refers to a method of executing someone. Soldiers nailed the prisoner to a wooden cross through the wrists and feet. Then they raised the cross and stood it up in a hole in the ground. The person hung from the cross in great pain until he died. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>nailed to a cross</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>put on a cross to die</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you have translated one or more of the Gospels, see how you translated this word in Matthew 20:19, Mark 15:13, Luke 23:21, or John 19:6.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 11:8b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The “great city” is described in two ways in 11:8b–c. It is given two symbolic names. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that Jesus was crucified in Sodom and Egypt. If that is true in your language, you may want to reorder the phrases. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>where their Lord was crucified, which is also figuratively called Sodom and Egypt.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>where the Lord was killed. This city is named Sodom and Egypt, which has a spiritual meaning. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>where their Lord was crucified.

But it is also possible that the elders are saying this just before God judges all people (20:11–15). Use a word or phrase that allows for either interpretation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>judge:</strong> This word means “decide whether a person is guilty or not.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the dead:</strong> This phrase refers to people who have died.</p><h4>11:18d–e</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Your servants the prophets, as well as the saints:</strong> There are several ways to interpret the relationship between the phrase <em>Your servants</em> and the rest of these words.

Another way to translate this word is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>give rewards</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Your servants the prophets:</strong> This phrase indicates that the <em>prophets</em> were God’s <em>servants</em>. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the prophets who served you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your servants, namely, the prophets</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">A similar phrase, “His servants the prophets,” occurs in 10:7.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>all your people, all who have reverence for you, (GNT) <em>(GNT, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The phrase <em>those who fear Your name</em> refers to a group <u>separate</u> from all the previous groups. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for the saints and for those who fear your name, (NJB) <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, NJB, NASB, NABRE, NLT, GW, NET, REB, ESV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). It is more likely that the phrase <em>those who fear Your name</em> describes all followers.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Beale (page 616), Lenski (pages 356–357), Osbourne (pages 446–447), and others support interpretation (1). Aune (page 645) and Swete (page 144) say that the two groups are Jewish and Gentile Christians, based on similar phrases in Acts 13. But Beale, Lenski, and Osbourne say that a connection to Acts 13 is inappropriate here.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>saints:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>saints</em> means “holy ones.” Here the word refers to all believers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>your people (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 5:8 or 8:3.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>those who fear Your name:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>fear</em> is often translated “reverence.” Here the Greek word means “respect” or “revere.” People who fear God think about him humbly, with awe. They worship and obey him. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all who respect you (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people who honor your name (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who reverence your name (NIV)</p></blockquote><h4>11:18f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:18f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>both small and great—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>both humble and important,</p></li><li><p>those of both low and high status.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>both small and great:</strong> This phrase refers to believers of low status in society and believers of high status in society. It implies believers of all classes and position in society. The phrase does not refer to physical size.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to have the high status first. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>both of high and lowly position/place</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>whether <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they are</span> important <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> or not</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>both humble and great</p></blockquote><h4>11:18g</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:18g\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and to destroy those who destroy the earth.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the time</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">has come</span> to destroy/ruin the people who destroy/ruin the earth.”</p></li><li><p>Now is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">also</span> the time when you will destroy/ruin those who destroy/ruin the world/land.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those who destroy the earth:</strong> This phrase refers to all people who harm the earth or any part of it.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some scholars (i.e. Aune, Beale, Kistemaker) think that “earth” refers to the people of the earth.

Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those who ruin the earth</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase could also refer to Satan and demons.

A <em>sign</em> suggests or points to something other than itself. Other ways to translate the Greek phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a great and wondrous sign (NIV84)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a great and mysterious sight (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a great portent (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a great wonder (KJV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>great:</strong> Here the word <em>great</em> refers to the intensity or importance of the sign. The word does not refer to size here. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>spectacular</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>amazing</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>appeared:</strong> This word indicates that before this time the sign was not visible and then suddenly it was visible.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>heaven:</strong> The Greek word can mean either “heaven” or “sky.” There are two ways to interpret the Greek word:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The word means <u>heaven</u> here, as in the BSB. This word refers generally to the location where John saw these things. The vision appeared or occurred in the spiritual realm. <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, NJB, NASB, NLT, NET, REB, NCV, ESV, KJV)</em></p></li><li><p>The word means <u>sky</u> here. This word further indicates that the sign appeared above the ground with the sky as its background. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the sky (GNT) <em>(GNT, NABRE, GW, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">People in John’s time generally understood the spiritual realm to be up in the sky. Greek only has one word to refer to both heaven and sky. Some languages, like English, have two different words. If that is true in your language, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because the same Greek word in 11:19 clearly refers to heaven.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Beale (page 625), Aune (page 650), Lenski (page 361), Osbourne (page 455), Smalley (page 299), Hughes (on TW), and Kistemaker (page 351) support interpretation (1).</span></span></p><h4>12:1b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">The symbols of the sun, moon, and twelve stars indicate that the woman probably represents Israel. Or it may represent all people who believe in Jesus as the Christ. These believers are then represented as the spiritual Israel. In either case, the woman represents the people of God.</p><h4>12:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>a woman clothed in the sun, with the moon under her feet</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>a woman with the sun as her clothing, the moon under her feet,</p></li><li><p>It was a woman. Her clothes were the sun. The moon was under her feet.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a woman clothed in the sun:</strong> This clause refers to the sun covering the woman like clothing covers a person. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a woman whose clothes were the sun (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a woman robed with the sun (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with the moon under her feet:</strong> This phrase can mean either:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The bottom of the woman’s feet touched the moon.</p></li><li><p>The moon was a small distance below her feet.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this phrase so that it allows both meanings. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and who had the moon under her feet (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and the moon was under her feet (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>12:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and a crown of twelve stars on her head.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and a wreath/crown <span data-bnType=\"implied\">made</span> of twelve stars.</p></li><li><p>Her head was wreathed/encircled with twelve stars.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a crown of twelve stars on her head:</strong> The phrase <em>on her head</em> is emphasized in the Greek. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>on her head a crown of twelve stars (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>her head was crowned/wreathed with twelve stars</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If possible, emphasize the phrase <em>on her head</em> in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a crown of twelve stars:</strong> This phrase probably indicates that the stars were placed around her head like a crown. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a crown/wreath made of twelve stars</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>twelve stars <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in a circle</span> like a crown</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>crown:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>crown</em> refers to a victor’s wreath. It was worn on the head as a sign of having won a contest.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">But here, the word probably refers to the twelve stars placed around her head so that it looked like a wreath of stars. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wreath</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>headdress</p></blockquote>",

It had seven heads</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">12:3b begins with the Greek words that mean “and look.” The word emphasizes or calls attention to the words that follow. The words also probably indicate surprise or suddenness. The word “look” here is not a command to look at something. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>indeed/hey,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and what should appear but</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Suddenly/Unexpectedly,</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>huge:</strong> This word means “very big.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>dragon:</strong> This word refers to a creature that is mythical. It refers to a large land animal or possibly a large sea animal. A Greek mosaic done about 300 years before Jesus was born shows one type of Greek dragon:</p><p data-indent=\"2\">A sculpture on a wall in Babylon was done around 300 years before Jesus was born. It shows their thoughts about what a dragon looked like:</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This next illustration is from a Persian artist about 1430 AD:</p><p data-indent=\"2\">They are usually considered to be much larger than people. Dragons were usually thought to be fierce and dangerous. Here the <em>dragon</em> symbolizes something evil, namely Satan.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages do not have a word for <em>dragon</em>. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a generic word for a fierce, mythical creature. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>monster</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Describe <em>dragon</em> by using a fierce animal known today as a basis. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>fierce snake/lizard</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>crocodile</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the word for a similar dangerous mythical creature that your readers already know about. You may then want to explain the Greek word in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Literally: “dragon.” This is a mythical creature that was large and fierce.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the major language word for <em>dragon</em>. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A dragon is a mythical creature. They were thought to be large and fierce. They were often described as something like a lizard or reptile.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">The <em>dragon</em> is a symbol for Satan. In some languages a literal translation would not indicate that the <em>dragon</em> is a symbol for Satan. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain the symbol in a footnote. Some example footnotes are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The dragon/lizard is a symbol for Satan.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The dragon/lizard represents Satan.</p></blockquote><h4>12:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>ten horns, and seven royal crowns on his heads.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and there were ten horns and seven crowns on his heads.</p></li><li><p>with a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">king’s/ruler’s</span> headdress on each head indicating he was king/ruler.

You should not try to explain the meaning in your translation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>horns:</strong> This word refers to animal horns. The horn was a symbol of strength.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>seven royal crowns on his heads:</strong> Each head had a crown on it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>royal crowns:</strong> This word refers to the decorated metal circles that kings usually wear on their heads. The <em>royal crowns</em> here are a symbol of authority to rule people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word here is different than the Greek word that the BSB translates as “crown” in 12:1c. In some languages people are not familiar with <em>royal crowns</em>. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain the meaning in your translation.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>With his tail he dragged a third of the stars out of the sky (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>a third of the stars:</strong> Here the word <em>third</em> means “one out of every three.” For example, in a group of three thousand stars, one thousand stars fell to earth.

They have the same meaning here. If you are unclear as to the meaning, see the notes there. Here these words refer to the son (12:5a), not believers.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>nations:</strong> Here the word <em>nations</em> can refer to language groups as well as groups under one government. If possible, use a word or phrase that allows either meaning.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 12:5a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In 12:5a the baby is described as both a son and a male child to emphasize the fact that the child was male. In some languages it is more natural to make the phrase “male child” the subject of the following clause (12:5b). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5a</sup>She gave birth to a son. This boy <sup>5b</sup>will rule all nations…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5a</sup>The woman was delivered of a boy, <sup>5b</sup>the son who was to rule all the nations… (NJB)</p></blockquote></div><h4>12:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And her child was caught up to God and to His throne.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And her child was grabbed and taken up to God and to his throne.</p></li><li><p>But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">someone</span> quickly lifted her child to God and to his place/seat of ruling.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">This sentence resumes describing the vision from 12:5a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And:</strong> There is some contrast between what the dragon wanted to do (12:4c) and what happened here. In some languages translating the contrast is more natural. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>her child was caught up:</strong> Here the word <em>caught up</em> refers to taking the child away quickly and forcefully. He <em>was caught up</em> in order to rescue him from danger. Here the word does not refer to stealing or taking him wrongfully.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. Probably God commanded someone to snatch her child. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God caused/commanded someone to</span> snatch her child</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">someone</span> quickly took her child</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to God and to His throne:</strong> In some languages it is more natural to add another verb or verbs here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>and taken</u> to God and to his throne (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He <u>was taken</u> to God and <u>placed</u> on his throne (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His throne:</strong> The pronoun <em>His</em> probably refers to God,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>as Beale, Beckwith, Smalley, and Kistemaker say.</span></span> but may refer to the child.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>as Johnson and Aune say.</span></span> You should not explain in your translation to whom the word <em>His</em> refers here.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>throne:</strong> This word refers to the official chair of a king. It is a symbol of his power to rule. Here the word <em>throne</em> indicates that God rules heaven and earth.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 1:4.</p>",

But the pronoun “they” does not clearly refer to anyone in the previous verses. So some English versions use a passive clause as the BSB does.

If you have translated Genesis 3:1, use the same word for <em>serpent</em> here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>called the devil and Satan:</strong> The Greek words are literally “the one being called the devil and Satan.” It explains that the dragon in the vision is actually the devil, who is also named Satan.

If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about Satan. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He is the deceiver of the whole world.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the deceiver:</strong> This phrase refers to deceiving people and persuading them to do wrong things. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who leads the whole world astray (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who has been leading people all over the world to sin</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the whole world:</strong> Here this phrase refers to all the <u>people</u> throughout the whole world.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 12:9a–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Added information about the dragon comes after the main verb of 12:9. In some languages it is more natural to present the added information differently than the BSB. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>9a–c</sup>The great dragon, <u>the primeval serpent, known as the devil or Satan, who had led all the world astray,</u> was hurled down (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is more natural to put the added information in a separate sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>9a</sup>The great dragon was hurled down. <sup>9b</sup>It/He is that ancient serpent called the devil or Satan. <sup>9c</sup>He leads the whole world astray.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The great dragon <sup>9b</sup>is that ancient serpent called the devil or Satan, <sup>9c</sup>who leads the whole world astray. <sup>9a</sup>He was hurled down.</p></blockquote></div><h4>12:9d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:9d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Yet he had been thrown to the earth along with his <span data-bnType=\"implied\">evil</span> angels.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Indeed,</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Michael and his angels</span> had thrown him and his demons to the earth.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him:</strong> This clause continues the story after John described the dragon in 12:9b–c. The Greek words are literally “he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him” (as in the RSV). The BSB does not repeat the verb phrase “thrown down,” because it is not required in English.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Michael and his angels</span> threw him and his angels/demons to the earth</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 12:9a–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The dragon and his angels were thrown to earth only once. But the word “thrown” appears in 12:9a and 12:9d. The word “thrown” in 12:9d refers again to the event in 12:9a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages translating the word “thrown” in both 12:9a and 12:9d would indicate that they were thrown twice. If that is true in your language, you should:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Indicate that 12:9d refers to the same event as 12:9a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>9a</sup>The great dragon was hurled down—<sup>9b</sup>that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, <sup>9c</sup>who leads the whole world astray. <u>Indeed,</u> <sup>9d</sup>he was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Combine 12:9d with 12:9a.

He is <sup>9b</sup>that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, <sup>9c</sup>who leads the whole world astray.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use only the evil angels as the subject in 12:9d.

The first sign was a woman, representing the people of God. The second sign was a dragon, representing Satan. The woman was about to give birth, and the dragon wanted to kill the child. The child is symbolic of Jesus as the Christ. God took the son to heaven and protected the woman.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In 12:7–12, John interrupted the story of the woman and the dragon to tell about the war between the dragon and the angels. These verses help explain why the dragon wanted to kill the woman. In 12:13, John continued the story of the woman and the dragon.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The sign of the dragon chasing the woman</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The vision of the woman and the dragon</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The <span data-bnType=\"implied\">spiritual</span> conflict of God’s people and Satan</p></blockquote></div><h4>12:10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And I heard a loud voice in heaven saying:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Then I heard loud speech/words in heaven saying,</p></li><li><p>¶ Then I heard someone in heaven say loudly,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a loud voice in heaven:</strong> John does not say who spoke here, but it does not refer to God (12:10b). Use a phrase that refers to anyone (except God) in heaven. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>loud speech in heaven</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">someone</span> say loudly in heaven</p></blockquote><h4>12:10b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of His Christ:</strong> Here the phrase <em>have come</em> indicates that God’s <em>salvation</em>, <em>power</em>, <em>kingdom</em>, and Christ’s <em>authority</em> are now present and completely in effect.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In many languages it is not possible or natural to use the word <em>come</em> with the words <em>salvation</em>, <em>power</em>, <em>kingdom</em>, and <em>authority</em>. If that is true in your language, you may need to translate differently. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ have been completed/achieved</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s salvation has arrived! His power is at work! His kingdom is present! Christ’s authority is in effect!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This is the time when our God finishes the work of saving people, the time of his full power and kingdom, and this is the time when his Christ has full authority.</p></blockquote><h4>12:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“Our<sup>(incl)</sup> God’s salvation, power, and kingdom have now <span data-bnType=\"implied\">fully</span> come,</p></li><li><p>“Now <span data-bnType=\"implied\">at last</span> our<sup>(incl)</sup> God has saved us <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in every way</span>! He has used his power <span data-bnType=\"implied\">fully</span> and begun to reign <span data-bnType=\"implied\">without limit</span>!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Now:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Now</em> is emphatic. It indicates that <u>finally</u> the time had come. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It has come at last (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God:</strong> The phrase <em>of our God</em> belongs to all three nouns: <em>salvation</em>, <em>power</em>, and <em>kingdom</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>our God’s salvation, power, and kingdom</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>salvation:</strong> This word refers to saving people from hell, death, or danger. Here it also refers to saving people from the deceiver, Satan. The word is a noun that refers to an event. In some languages it is more natural to use a phrase with a verb here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>saving/freeing by God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of his people</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for God to save mankind</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>saving from death</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 7:10.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>kingdom:</strong> This word refers to a group of people ruled by one king. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>empire (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here the word <em>kingdom</em> probably refers to the fact that God rules over all things. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>kingship</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>position of ruling <span data-bnType=\"implied\">over all things</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 1:6 or 5:10.</p><h4>12:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and the authority of His Christ.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>as well as his Christ’s authority.</p></li><li><p>His Christ’s authority is in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">full</span> force</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>authority:</strong> This word refers to having the right and power to control or rule over someone or something. Here the word is general and indicates that Jesus has the right and power to do anything he chooses to do.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Christ:</strong> The word <em>Christ</em> is a title for Jesus. It means “the anointed one.” See how you translated this word in 1:1 or 11:15.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 12:10b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The BSB has placed the verb phrase “have come” before the subject. This is a formal English poetic style. In the Greek the verb is in the normal place for a Greek clause. You should place it in the normal place for your language. For example, the RSV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ <u>have come</u></p></blockquote><h5><strong>General Comment on 12:10b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is more natural to translate this exclamation as two or more sentences. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now God’s salvation has come! Now God has shown his power as King! Now his Messiah has shown his authority! (GNT)</p></blockquote></div><h4>12:10d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:10d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For the blamer of our<sup>(incl)</sup> brothers has been thrown down,</p></li><li><p>because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Michael and his angels</span> have thrown down the one who accuses our fellow believers <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of sin</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> This conjunction introduces the basis for 12:10b–c. 12:10d–f indicate why the salvation, power, kingdom, and authority are in full effect. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>accuser:</strong> This word refers to someone who claims another person has done wrong. Here the word refers to Satan. Satan is always going to God and accusing believers of sinning. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the one who always accuses</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>continually blaming person</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>brothers:</strong> This word refers generally to both men and women believers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>brothers and sisters (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>has been thrown down:</strong> The clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">they</span> threw him down</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">12:10d–e puts the focus on Satan. Some languages may need to reorder the 12:10d–e. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>For <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Michael and his angels</span> <sup>10e</sup>have thrown down <sup>10d</sup>the accuser of our brothers, <sup>10f</sup>who accuses them day and night before our God .</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>For <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Michael and his angels</span> <sup>10e</sup>have thrown down <sup>10d</sup>the accuser of our brothers. <sup>10f</sup>He accused them day and night before our God.</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 12:10d–e</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Both 12:10d and 12:10e use a form of the word “accuse.” In some languages it is more natural to combine 12:10d–e. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Satan accuses our people in the presence of God day and night. Now he has been thrown out! (CEV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>12:10e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:10e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>he who accuses them day and night before our God.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>who blames them <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for sinning</span> before our<sup>(incl)</sup> God day and night.</p></li><li><p>He used to accuse them before God constantly.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he who accuses them day and night before our God:</strong> The clause <em>he who accuses them day and night before our God</em> tells the reader more about the accuser (12:10d). In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other accusers and only this one <em>accuses them day and night before our God</em>. If that is true in your language, translate these words so that they tell more about the accuser. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10e</sup>has been hurled down. <sup>10f</sup>He accuses them before our God day and night.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>day and night:</strong> This phrase indicates that Satan accuses believers all the time.</p>",

Considering the rest of this verse, it seems most likely the connection is to 12:9–10 rather than 12:11. But some scholars (for example, Beale and Osbourne) include 12:11.</span></span> Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For this reason, (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Because of that,</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>rejoice, O heavens, and you who dwell in them!:</strong> The direct address is after the command. In some languages it is more natural to have the direct address first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you heavens and you who dwell in them, rejoice!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>rejoice:</strong> This word is a command. In some languages it is not natural to command people to rejoice. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Change the command to an exhortation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you heavens and you who dwell in them, <u>let us rejoice</u></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Change the command to a time clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you heavens and you who dwell in them, <u>now is the time to rejoice</u></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the verb “celebrate” (or similar verb) to indicate rejoicing indirectly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you heavens and you who dwell in them, <u>celebrate</u></p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>O heavens, and you who dwell in them!:</strong> The loud voice speaks to the <em>heavens</em> as though they were people. The phrase <em>you who dwell in them</em> refers to the angels who live with God <u>in</u> heaven.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is not natural to speak directly to the <em>heavens</em>. If that is true in your language, you may want to refer to the angels and other beings in the <em>heavens</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>everyone <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and everything</span> in the heavens</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all who dwell in heaven</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>heavens:</strong> At that time many people thought that heaven had several layers. Each layer was a different “heaven.” But in the New Testament the plural <em>heavens</em> has the same meaning as the singular “heaven.” In some languages the singular “heaven” is more natural. See the above example.</p><h4>12:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But woe to the earth and the sea;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>How terrible for the earth and the sea,</p></li><li><p>But there will be <span data-bnType=\"implied\">great</span> trouble for <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all creatures/beings</span> on the earth and in the seas;</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But:</strong> The Greek does not have a conjunction here. However, many English versions add <em>But</em> to indicate the contrast between 12:12a and 12:12b.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>woe to the earth and the sea:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>woe</em> here means “There will be trouble for (someone).” The word indicates sorrow about the troubles. The speaker was saying that the earth and the sea are to be pitied, for they will soon have great trouble. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>how terrible for the earth and the sea (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>alas for the earth and the sea (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">great</span> trouble <span data-bnType=\"implied\">comes</span> to the earth and the sea</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the earth and the sea:</strong> This phrase refers to the whole world and implies all the creatures that live there.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>sea:</strong> The word <em>sea</em> refers to a large body of water. A <em>sea</em> is often so large that someone standing on one side cannot see the other side. The word <em>sea</em> is symbolic, so you should not name a particular <em>sea</em>. See how you translated this word in 5:13 or 10:2.</p><h4>12:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>with great fury</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He is very angry,</p></li><li><p>with fierce anger, (GW)</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">The Greek wording of 12:12c begins with a conjunction that is often translated as “because” or “for.” It introduces the reason for the warning to the earth and the sea. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Some English versions, like the BSB, do not translate this conjunction, but leave the connection with 12:12b implicit.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with great fury:</strong> This clause indicates that the devil is very angry. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He is filled with anger (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he is very angry (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He is furious</p></blockquote><h4>12:12d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:12d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the devil has come down to you,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because the Devil/Slanderer has descended to you<sup>(plur)</sup>/them.</p></li><li><p>the Demon Chief has come down to you,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the devil has come down to you:</strong> This clause indicates that the devil left heaven and went to the earth.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you:</strong> Here the pronoun <em>you</em> refers to the earth and the sea (12:12b). In some languages it is more natural to use the pronoun “them.”</p><h4>12:12e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:12e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>knowing he has only a short time.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because he knows that he has little time left.”</p></li><li><p>for he knows that little time is left to him.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>knowing he has only a short time:</strong> The devil knew that he only had a short time left to accomplish his purposes. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>knowing that he has little time left (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he knows that he does not have much time <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to do what he wanted to do</span></p></blockquote>",

(2) Some later Greek manuscripts have the phrase <u>Jesus Christ</u> (KJV only).

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>hold to the testimony of Jesus (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>testimony:</strong> The word <em>testimony</em> means “the words spoken about what one saw.” See how you translated this word in 1:2 or 6:9.</p><h4>12:17d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:17d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And the dragon stood on the shore of the sea.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He <span data-bnType=\"implied\">went and</span> stood on the seashore.</p></li><li><p>The dragon <span data-bnType=\"implied\">came and</span> stood on the beach.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">See the General Comment below about the different locations that 12:17d is placed in various English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And the dragon stood on the shore of the sea:</strong> There is a textual issue here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The earliest Greek manuscripts say <u>he stood</u>.

See how you translated this word in 12:3.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 12:17d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The people who divided the Greek text into chapters and verses long ago probably had manuscripts that followed option (2) above. So they understood this Greek clause to be part of chapter 13. However, many English versions follow option (1). It indicates that the Greek clause connects to the topic in 12:13–17.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Several ways to indicate that the Greek clause connects to the topic in 12:13–17 are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Include the clause at the end of 12:17, as the BSB does. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12:17</sup>Then the dragon was angry with the woman, and went off to make war on the rest of her offspring, on those who keep the commandments of God and bear testimony to Jesus. <u>And he stood on the sand of the seashore.</u></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>13:1</sup>And I saw a beast rising out of the sea, (RSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Keep the clause as 13:1a but indicate that it belongs with 12:17. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12:17</sup>Furious with the woman, the dragon went off to wage war on the rest of her offspring, those who keep God’s commandments and maintain their witness to Jesus. <sup>13:1</sup>He took his stand on the seashore<u>.</u></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then I saw a beast rising out of the sea. (REB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Mark the clause as a new verse: 12:18. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12:17</sup>…and are faithful to the truth revealed by Jesus. <sup>18</sup>And the dragon stood on the seashore<u>.</u></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>13:1</sup>Then I saw a beast coming up out of the sea. (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Place this clause so that it clearly indicates its meaning here. You may want to see where the major language version puts it.</p></div>",

The dragon gave authority to this beast. The beast slandered God. The beast killed believers. Non-believers worshiped him.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">If you followed option (2) for the textual issue at 12:17d, you should have this section heading before 12:17d.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The beast from the sea</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The beast that blasphemed God</p></blockquote></div><h4>13:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"13:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Then I saw a beast with ten horns and seven heads rising out of the sea.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Then I saw a beast rising from the sea, which had ten horns and seven heads,</p></li><li><p>¶ Then I saw a monster ascending from the sea. He/It had ten horns and seven heads,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Then I saw a beast with ten horns and seven heads rising out of the sea:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>Then</em> introduces the clause <em>I saw a beast…rising out of the sea</em>. Introduce or begin this clause naturally in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Then</u> I saw a beast coming up out of the sea. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I saw a beast coming out of the sea (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a beast:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>beast</em> does not have the Greek article (the English definite article is “the”) in front of it. So the English versions translate this as <em>a beast</em>. But 17:3–8 makes it clear that the beast of 11:7 is the same beast here. You should not indicate that the beast here is different from the beast in 11:7.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>beast:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>beast</em> refers to any animal, often a wild animal. The BSB uses the word <em>beast</em> to imply that this being is fierce, dangerous, and evil. Here the word refers to one of Satan’s servants.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would not clearly indicate the symbolic meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a word that clearly refers to an evil creature or being. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>monster</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Explain the symbol in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The word “beast” refers to one of the devil’s servants.

You should translate literally, as you did in 12:3.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>horns:</strong> This word refers to horns that are like animal horns.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>rising out of the sea:</strong> The Greek verb indicates the direction “up.” The beast somehow rose from under the surface of the sea and went to the shore. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>rising out of the sea (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>ascending from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the bottom of</span> the sea</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>sea:</strong> The word <em>sea</em> refers to large bodies of water. A <em>sea</em> is often so large that someone standing on one side cannot see the other side. In Hebrew culture, the <em>sea</em> was a symbol of chaos. Some languages do not have a word or phrase for “sea.” If that is true in your language, you may want to describe it in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the saltwater <span data-bnType=\"implied\">place</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>large body of water</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>large round water</p></blockquote><h4>13:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"13:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>There were ten royal crowns on its horns</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and ten crowns on his horns.</p></li><li><p>and a headdress on each horn indicating that he was king.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>There were ten royal crowns on its horns:</strong> Probably each horn had a crown on it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>royal crowns:</strong> This word refers to a decorated metal circle that kings usually wear on their heads. The <em>royal crowns</em> here are symbols of the authority to rule people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages people are not familiar with <em>royal crowns</em>. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain the meaning in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>headpieces/hats of rulers</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>headdresses of authority</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 12:3.</p><h4>13:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"13:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and blasphemous names on its heads.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Each head had a name that insulted God.</p></li><li><p>A name that dishonored/slandered God was <span data-bnType=\"implied\">written</span> on each head.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>blasphemous names on its heads:</strong> The words “there were” are implied from 13:1b.

If that is true in your language, there are two ways to interpret this phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to being given <u>permission</u> to make war. For example, the NLT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the beast was allowed to wage war <em>(BSB, RSV, NJB, NABRE, ESV, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to being given the <u>power</u> to make war. For example, the NCV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It was given power to make war <em>(NIV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because it seems the more natural implied meaning in the Greek here.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Aune and Smalley support interpretation (1). This author found no commentary that explained why one interpretation was better than the other.</span></span> The Greek phrase implies that the beast did indeed make war against the saints (and conquer them). Your translation should imply or indicate that.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>was permitted:</strong> This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. As in 13:5, probably the dragon gave this power. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The dragon</span> gave to him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he received permission<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In some languages “take” and “receive” is translated by the same verb. The English verb “receive” implies that someone gave the power, but the English verb “take” does not imply that. Your translation should imply or indicate that someone gave it.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the saints:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>saints</em> means “holy ones.” Here the word refers generally to believers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s people (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 5:8 or 8:3.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to conquer them:</strong> The phrase “was given to it” is implied but not repeated here. In some languages it is more natural to repeat it. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">he was permitted/allowed</span> to conquer them</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>conquer:</strong> This word means “defeat and rule over.” The beast would defeat the believers. Then he would decide whether to kill them, put them in prison, or give some other punishment to them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>defeat (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>13:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"13:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and it was given authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And he was allowed to rule every tribe/clan, people/land, language, and nation.</p></li><li><p>And he received power to control every tribe, every people-group, every language, and every country.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it was given authority:</strong> This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. Again, probably the dragon gave the authority. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the dragon</span> gave to him authority</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he received authority<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In some languages “take” and “receive” is translated by the same verb.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>every tribe, every language, every people, and every nation</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this phrase in 5:9 or 11:9.

Here it refers to all people except believers. The names of believers were written in the Book of Life. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>All people living on earth will worship it, <u>except</u> those whose names were written… (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>13:8a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"13:8a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And all who dwell on the earth will worship the beast—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>All the people living on the earth will worship/honor the beast,</p></li><li><p>All those on the earth will revere the beast,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who dwell on the earth:</strong> The word <em>who dwell</em> refers to people living somewhere. These people <em>who dwell</em> lived on <em>the earth</em>. So this phrase refers to all people alive, except believers (13:8b–c).</p><h4>13:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"13:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>all whose names have not been written from the foundation of the world in the Book of Life</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>except the people whose names have been written in the Book of Life before the world/universe was created.</p></li><li><p>namely, those whose names the Lamb did not write in the book. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">The Lamb wrote the names of those to whom he will give</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">eternal</span> life in that book. He wrote the names before he made the earth/universe.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>all whose names have not been written:</strong> The clause <em>whose names have not been written</em> is passive. Some languages must use an active or intransitive clause. Probably Jesus wrote the names, because this book is his. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>all whose names that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the Lamb</span> has not written</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>all whose names were not</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>from the foundation of the world:</strong> This phrase refers to when God wrote some names but did not write these names.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>from:</strong> In other occurrences of the phrase “from the creation” in the NT, the word <em>from</em> indicates that the event in those verses occurred at or before creation. So it is likely here that these names were written at or before creation.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Revelation 17:8, Matthew 13:35 and 25:34.</span></span> Therefore, some English versions use “before” to be more clear here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>before the foundation of the world (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the foundation of the world:</strong> This phrase uses the noun <em>foundation</em> to describe an event. Some ways to translate it are:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Use a passive clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the world was created</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God/he</span> created the world</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate without using a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the founding/beginning of the world</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>world:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>world</em> here probably refers to all created things. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>universe</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>all that God created</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>creation (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Book of Life:</strong> This phrase refers to a <em>Book</em> that has the names of people to whom God will give eternal <em>Life</em>. Some languages need to explain the word <em>of</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the book <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in which are the names</span> of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">those who have</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">eternal</span> life</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the book <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with/having the names</span> of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">those to whom God will give</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">eternal</span> life</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this phrase in 3:5.</p><h4>13:8c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"13:8c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>belonging to the Lamb who was slain.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>That book belongs to the Lamb who was killed.</p></li><li><p>It is his book. People killed him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">on the cross</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Lamb who was slain:</strong> The clause <em>who was slain</em> tells the reader more about the Lamb. The phrase <em>the Lamb</em> here is the symbolic title for Jesus. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other people with the symbolic title <em>the Lamb</em>. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about <em>the Lamb</em>. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Lamb. He was slain.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Lamb. He was killed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">on the cross</span>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Lamb. He was killed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">but he lives again</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Lamb:</strong> This is a title for Jesus. Jewish people killed a lamb at the Passover as a sacrifice to God. The lamb has symbolic meaning as a special sacrifice and is a symbol for the Christ. See how you translated this title in 5:6 or 7:14.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>who was slain:</strong> This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. Here it is not important to indicate who killed the Lamb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Lamb whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people/they</span> killed</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 13:8b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">There are four things said here:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Some people’s names were written in the Book of Life and some people’s names were not written in it.</p></li><li><p>The names were written before God made the universe.</p></li><li><p>That Book of Life belongs to the Lamb.</p></li><li><p>The Lamb was slain.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is more natural to use another sentence or several sentences for some of this information.

That book belongs to the Lamb that was slain.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>all whose names have not been written in the Book of Life. That book is the Lamb’s book.

The word is not a command to look at something. Other ways to translate these words are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and indeed/hey, the Lamb</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and suddenly/unexpectedly I saw the Lamb</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Lamb:</strong> This is a title for Jesus. Jewish people killed a lamb at the Passover as a sacrifice to God. The lamb has symbolic meaning as a special sacrifice and is a symbol for the Christ. See how you translated this title in 5:6 or 13:8.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Mount Zion:</strong> <em>Zion</em> is the name of the hill in Jerusalem southwest of the temple. In the Old Testament, <em>Mount Zion</em> was symbolic of God’s holy city, Jerusalem. Here also, the name <em>Mount Zion</em> probably represents Jerusalem.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages people do not know where Mount Zion is. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Explain it in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Mount Zion is a hill in the city of Jerusalem.

This may be numerals such as <em>144,000</em> or number words such as “one hundred forty-four thousand.” See how you translated this number in 7:4.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This number may refer to the number of men that John saw (14:4a). In some languages it is more natural to include the noun “men” with the number. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>144,000 men</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, some scholars think that the 144,000 refers to both men and women. They interpret 14:4a as referring to both men and women sincerely following Jesus. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>144,000 people (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>14:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"14:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who had His name and His Father’s name written on their foreheads.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>who had his name and his Father’s name on their foreheads.</p></li><li><p>They had on their foreheads <span data-bnType=\"implied\">both</span> his name and his Father’s name.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who had His name and His Father’s name written on their foreheads:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is a textual issue in 14:1c: (1) The earliest Greek manuscripts have the text <u>his name and his father’s name</u> (BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NABRE, REB, ESV, NCV). (2) Some later Greek manuscripts have the text <u>his father’s name</u> (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1), because the UBS Greek NT supports it.</span></span> This clause tells the reader more about the 144,000 men/believers. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other groups of 144,000 men/believers, and only this group had these names <em>written on their foreheads</em>. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about the 144,000. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They had his name and his Father’s name written on their foreheads.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>who had His name and His Father’s name written:</strong> The clause is passive. Some languages must use an active or intransitive clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who had his name and his Father’s name which <span data-bnType=\"implied\">angels/someone</span> wrote</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>upon whose foreheads was his name and his Father’s name</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you translate this second example, it should imply that someone wrote the name.</p>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as virgins (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">But many English versions translate literally and allow the reader to decide whether to understand this clause literally or figuratively.</p><h4>14:4c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"14:4c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>They follow the Lamb wherever He goes.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They follow the Lamb wherever he goes/leads.</p></li><li><p>They always follow/obey the Lamb’s commands.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>They follow the Lamb wherever He goes:</strong> This clause refers figuratively to obeying Jesus as their master or leader. These men/believers always did as Jesus commanded them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they follow the Lamb wherever he leads (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that these men/believers physically walked behind Jesus wherever he went. If that is true in your language, you should translate the figurative meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They have not separated from the Lamb wherever he goes</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They obey everything that the Lamb tells them</p></blockquote><h4>14:4d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"14:4d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>They have been redeemed from among men</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They were bought from mankind</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> had purchased them from among other people</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>They have been redeemed from among men:</strong> This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has purchased them from among men</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>redeemed:</strong> This verb is the same Greek verb as in 14:3d. There the BSB translated it as “redeemed.” It probably means “redeemed” here as well. Translate it as you did in 14:3.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>from among men:</strong> The Greek phrase is literally “from people.” It probably has the same or similar meaning as “from the earth” (14:3b).</p><h4>14:4e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"14:4e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to be an offering of the first part of the harvest to God and the Lamb,</p></li><li><p>to belong to him and to the Lamb, like the first part of harvested food belongs to God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb:</strong> This phrase describes the men/believers whom God purchased. Other ways to translate these words are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as first fruits for God and the Lamb (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to be the first–fruits for God and for the Lamb (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>as firstfruits:</strong> This phrase is a metaphor. In the Jewish society the first part of the harvest was given to God (Exodus 23:19, Leviticus 23:9–14). This offering was called <em>firstfruits</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here the 144,000 men/believers are like the first part of the harvest. They are set aside for God to use. In some languages it is more natural to translate this as a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>like an offering of the first part of the harvest</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>just as the first part of the harvest is offered</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>like the/a harvest offering</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you have translated James 1:18, see how you translated “firstfruits” there.</p>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The word “fallen” refers to God destroying the city (18:20).</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Babylon the great:</strong> The city <em>Babylon</em> is called <em>great</em> because it refers to a city of this time that had a vast empire and great influence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Great Babylon (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the famous Babylon</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Babylon:</strong> This name is probably a symbol of those who oppose God. The king of <em>Babylon</em> conquered Jerusalem about 600 years before Jesus was on earth. The city was well-known for idol worship. It had a vast empire at that time. But at the time of Jesus and John, <em>Babylon</em> had only a few people living there.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDAG (page 162).</span></span> So it is a symbol here. It may refer to Rome as in John’s time, or it may refer to a future powerful city. You should use the name <em>Babylon</em> here.</p><h4>14:8c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"14:8c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who has made all the nations drink the wine of the passion of her immorality.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>who/which forced all nations to drink the wine of her passionate adulteries.”</p></li><li><p>She/It caused all nations to share/participate in her/its passionate unfaithfulness <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span>.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">14:8c contains metaphors of drinking wine and adultery. They refer to people of the nations participating with Babylon in evil deeds. In the Old Testament God often refers figuratively to such evil deeds as adultery, because the people doing them are seeking things other than God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who has made all the nations drink the wine of the passion of her immorality:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>passion</em> can mean “sexual desire,” “anger,” or even “insanity.” There are several ways to interpret it here. The main interpretations are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>strong sexual desire</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>She made all peoples drink her wine—the strong wine of her <u>immoral lust</u> (GNT) <em>(BSB, RSV, GNT, NASB, NABRE, NLT, GW, NET, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>anger</u>. It refers to God’s anger with Babylon. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>She has made all nations drink of the wine of the <u>wrath</u> of her fornication (NRSV) <em>(NRSV, CEV, REB, NCV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>cause to be insane</u> or <u>make angry</u>. This is the meaning of “maddening” in the NIV. <em>(NIV)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Beale (page 756) says the word refers to passion and not anger here (similarly Aune (page 831) and Lenski (page 433)).</span></span> The word should then be understood as describing the adulteries: they were passionate or lustful. People desired to participate in the adulteries. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>She who made all nations drink the wine of her <u>passionate</u> unfaithfulness (JBP)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>drink the wine:</strong> Here this phrase refers figuratively to doing something. The nations participated with Babylon in her adulteries.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages the meaning of the metaphor is not clear. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Explain the meaning of the metaphor in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Here the phrase “drink the wine” is a metaphor for doing something. The nations participated with Babylon in her adulteries.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>participate in the bad deeds <em>You may then want to give the literal words in a footnote. An example footnote is:</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Literally: “drink the wine.”</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>wine:</strong> Wine is made from the juice of grapes, a fruit that grows on a vine. The grape juice is allowed to ferment, so <em>wine</em> is an alcoholic beverage. If people drink a lot of it, they become drunk. Here the word <em>wine</em> refers figuratively to Babylon’s evil ways.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages people are not familiar with <em>wine</em>. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>alcoholic beverage of wine</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the common alcoholic beverage in your area. You may then use a footnote to explain the literal word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Literally: “wine.” Wine is an alcoholic beverage made from grapes.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the word from the major language. If the word is not well known, you may want to explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Wine is an alcoholic beverage made from grapes. Here the word “wine” refers figuratively to the bad ways of Babylon that the nations followed.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 6:6.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>immorality:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>immorality</em> refers to sexual relations with someone to whom a person is not married. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>adulteries (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>fornication (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The word here refers figuratively to doing things that are immoral. Here it may refer to worshiping someone other than God, committing sexually immoral deeds, enticing people to sin, or misusing authority.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation will wrongly refer only to adultery. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Explain the meaning of the metaphor in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Here the word “adultery” is a metaphor for doing things that are immoral. It may refer to worshiping someone other than God, doing sexually immoral deeds, enticing people to sin, or misusing authority.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>immoral deeds <em>You may then want to give the literal word in a footnote. An example footnote is:</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Literally: “adultery.”</p></blockquote></li></ul>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>then</u> that person will also drink</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>too:</strong> This word indicates that the people who took the mark will also drink God’s wine. For example, the NASB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>also</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>will drink the wine:</strong> Here this phrase symbolically refers to experiencing something.

An example footnote is:</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Literally: “drink the wine.”</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God’s anger:</strong> The word <em>anger</em> refers to strong anger. In some languages the noun <em>anger</em> must be translated as a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God being very angry</p></blockquote><h4>14:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"14:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>poured undiluted into the cup of His wrath.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>which has been poured undiluted into the cup reserved for his wrath.</p></li><li><p>He will punish them to/in/with the full measure/amount of his anger.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>poured undiluted into the cup of His wrath:</strong> There are two issues here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><u>Issue 1—Descriptive Relative Clause</u></p><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause tells the reader more about God’s fury. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other kinds of fury and only this one has been <em>poured undiluted</em>. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about God’s fury. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It has been poured undiluted into the cup of his wrath.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><u>Issue 2—Metaphor</u></p><p data-indent=\"2\">This metaphor refers to God’s great anger against those who worship the beast. Another way to translate it is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he/God has poured out his anger without relenting</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause continues using the metaphor of God’s fury being like wine. If you translated the meaning of the metaphor in 14:10a, you should:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate the meaning of the metaphor here as well. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he/they will suffer the full force of God’s wrath</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He/They will suffer its full consequences! <em>You may then want to give the literal words in a footnote.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10a</sup>he will also drink of the wine of God’s fury. <sup>10b</sup>God will come against him with the full amount of his anger.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10a</sup>You will have to drink the wine that God gives to everyone who makes him angry. <sup>10b</sup>You will feel his mighty anger… (CEV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>poured undiluted:</strong> This clause is passive.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>which <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has poured full strength</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>undiluted:</strong> At that time, people often mixed wine with water to dilute it. Then the wine was weaker. But God’s anger is not “diluted.” He will not withhold some of his anger.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the cup of His wrath:</strong> The word <em>cup</em> continues the metaphor of “wine” (14:10a). A cup was the usual container for drinking wine.</p><h4>14:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"14:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And he will be tormented in fire and sulfur</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>That person will be tortured with fire and sulfur <span data-bnType=\"implied\">mixed together</span></p></li><li><p>They will suffer greatly because of the flaming/burning sulfur</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And he will be tormented:</strong> This clause is passive. Some languages must use an intransitive clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will suffer torment/pain</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>tormented:</strong> This word refers to causing someone to suffer. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>brought much suffering</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>caused pain</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 11:10.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in fire and sulfur:</strong> The BSB literally represents the Greek here. But the <em>fire and sulfur</em> were probably mixed together.

It probably also indicates that they are morally and spiritually perfect.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“Write this:…” (NIV11)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In order to avoid direct speech within direct speech, the BSB includes the command to write as part of the description of the angel. If your language does not have a way to express direct speech in this way, consider following the example of the BSB.</p><h4>14:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"14:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Blessed are the dead—those who die in the Lord from this moment on.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“Write:<sup>(sing)</sup> Those who die in the Lord from now on are favored.”</p></li><li><p>“Write this: ‘The people who die <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believing</span> in the Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus</span> from now on are in a good place <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in God’s eyes</span>.’ ”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Blessed:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Blessed</em> describes a person to whom God has shown favor/kindness. See how you translated this word in 1:3.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the dead—those who die in the Lord:</strong> This phrase refers to those who die as faithful believers in the Lord Jesus. They do not stop believing when the beast persecutes them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those who…die in the service of the Lord (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Lord:</strong> The word <em>Lord</em> refers to Jesus here. The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Lord</em> means “the one who has authority over (others),” or “owner.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to include “Jesus” in this phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>from this moment on:</strong> This phrase probably refers to when the second beast began to require everyone to take the mark (13:11–18).

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Spirit says, “Yes,…” (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Yes:</strong> Here the word <em>Yes</em> confirms what the person in heaven said (14:13b).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>says the Spirit:</strong> The BSB puts the verb <em>says</em> before <em>the Spirit</em>, who was doing the speaking. This is a poetic style in English. Place the verb <em>says</em> where it would be most natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the Spirit:</strong> Here this phrase refers to the Holy Spirit. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer to someone else. If that is true in your language, you may want to make the meaning clear:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Holy</span> Spirit</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the Spirit of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they will rest from their labors:</strong> This clause explains how believers will be blessed. They will be blessed because they will rest.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>labors:</strong> This word refers here to working hard to serve God. The believers suffered difficulties and persecution as they served God. They will not need to work hard and suffer in heaven. After believers die, they will rest and enjoy being with Jesus.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I saw in heaven another sign, indeed a great and marvelous one:</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>great:</strong> Here the word <em>great</em> refers to the intensity or importance of the sign.

These plagues are the last ones because God’s anger will end after they happen</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>with:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>with</em> is literally “having.” The word “having” indicates that the angels were somehow holding the plagues. They would mix these plagues in the bowls (15:7b).

The fire was not on top of the <em>sea of glass</em>. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a glassy sea blended/combined with fire</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a glass sea having fire mixed into it</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The clause is passive.

The BSB emphasizes the phrase in English by placing it <u>after</u> the verb “stood.” The Greek does not have an emphasized phrase. For example,</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, <u>and those who had been victorious over the beast and his image and the number of his name,</u> standing on the sea of glass, holding harps of God.

They remained faithful to Jesus even when the beast tortured or killed them. The believers were not victorious because they had won a battle.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer only to fighting. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Explain the meaning in your translation.

(2) A few later Greek manuscripts have the text <u>his mark the number of his name</u> (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1), because the UBS Greek NT supports it.</span></span> These are the three things that the believers were victorious over. They did not submit to the beast. They did not submit to his statue.

They also realize he is all-powerful and does as he chooses. So they respect him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages the word <em>fear</em> only means “be afraid of.” If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Include the meaning of “respect” or “revere.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>fear <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and respect/revere</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning of <em>fear</em> as “respect” or “revere.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>honor</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 14:7.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>O Lord:</strong> The Greek word is literally “Lord.” The BSB and other English versions add the word <em>O</em>. In English it probably indicates a formal address, as speaking to someone of high status. Some English versions do not add this word. The context clearly indicates that God has high status. For example, the NJB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Lord</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to have the direct address first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>Lord</u>, who will not fear you, and bring glory to your name?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Lord:</strong> The word <em>Lord</em> refers to God here. In some languages it is more natural to include “God” in this phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>glorify Your name:</strong> This phrase refers to honoring God. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>declare your greatness (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>acknowledge your glory</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>do homage to your name (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated a similar phrase “give glory” in 4:9 or 14:7.</p><h4>15:4c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"15:4c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For You alone are holy.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For only you are divine/perfect,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Everyone should do that</span> because only you are the sacred/unique one,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> This conjunction introduces the reason for people to fear and glorify God.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You are the only holy one (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>holy:</strong> Here the word <em>holy</em> indicates that God is perfect and unique. He only does what is right. He is different from all other beings. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>sacred/divine</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>pure/perfect <span data-bnType=\"implied\">spiritually/morally</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>unique/separate</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 3:7.</p><h4>15:4d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"15:4d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>All nations will come and worship before You,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and all nations will come before you and worship/revere you,</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because</span> all people groups will come to you and worship/honor you,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek 15:4d begins with the same conjunction as in 15:4c.

These commandments were called “the Testimony” (Exodus 34:29). The tent and the ark reminded the Jews that God had made a covenant with them.

God made a covenant with the Israelites. He wrote the ten most important commands of that covenant on two tablets of stone. Those tablets were later called the <em>Testimony</em>. They were put in a box called “the ark of the covenant.” God also told the Jews to make this special tent in which they would worship him. The tent where the box was kept was also called the tent (or tabernacle) of the <em>Testimony</em>. All these things reminded the Israelites about God’s covenant with them.

The BSB and some English versions use the conjunction <em>For</em>. Other English versions allow the context to indicate that it is an explanation. They do not explicitly translate the Greek conjunction. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They poured out the blood of God’s people…. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they have spilled the blood:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>spilled</em> is literally “poured out.” Both the Greek and the English phrase indicates that someone killed these believers because they believed in Jesus. God holds him or her or them responsible for killing these believers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The use of the word <em>blood</em> is important here because it is used again in 16:6b.

The <em>prophets</em> are a group of believers who prophesied.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>saints:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>saints</em> means “holy ones.” The word refers to all believers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s people (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 5:8 or 14:12.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>prophets:</strong> A <em>prophet</em> is a person to whom God gives a message. The message (often called a “prophecy”) may include a vision, as in Ezekiel 1 and Daniel 8. A prophecy may reveal something about past events, current events, or future events. The prophet speaks God’s message to the people or writes it down for their use.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that John was thinking of other gods and only this one <em>had authority over these plagues</em>. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about God.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they did not repent and give Him glory:</strong> The BSB literally represents the Greek here. This phrase indicates that the people did not turn away from their worship of false gods. The purpose of turning away from false gods was to honor the one true God.

(CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>repent:</strong> This word refers to changing one’s mind, heart, and actions. In this case it refers to no longer worshiping the image of the beast.

Blessed is he who stays awake and keeps his clothes with him, so that he may not go naked and be shamefully exposed.”</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Put this verse after 16:16 and name the combined verses 16:15–16. You may then want to make clear that the warning refers to the “great day of God Almighty.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Regarding the great day of God Almighty, the Lamb said,</span> “Behold, I come…</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse is a warning from Jesus.

(GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I am coming like a thief:</strong> This clause indicates that Jesus will come <u>unexpectedly</u>, as thieves do. The phrase <em>like a thief</em> does <u>not</u> mean that he will come to steal. It has the same meaning as in 3:3.

In the Bible, the good situation results from God showing favor/kindness to the person.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This word does not primarily refer to a feeling. However, a person in this good situation will frequently have good feelings like happiness and joy.

It would not refer to being prepared and ready for something to happen. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>These words refer figuratively to a believer being prepared and ready for something to happen.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate literally and explain its meaning in your translation.

Translate this phrase so that it clearly refers to a believer remaining strong in his faith.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>clothed:</strong> The Greek words are literally “keeping his clothes.” It probably implies wearing and guarding the clothes. Other ways to translate these words are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>has kept his clothes on (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>guards his clothes (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>16:15d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"16:15d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that he will not go naked and let his shame be exposed.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that he will not walk around naked and people see his shame/nakedness.”</p></li><li><p>In that way, they will not be naked in public and ashamed.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>go naked:</strong> The Greek words are literally “walk naked.” It refers to being naked in public.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>great Babylon (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Babylon:</strong> The name of this city is probably a symbol for people who oppose God. The king of <em>Babylon</em> conquered Jerusalem about six hundred years before Jesus lived on earth. The city was well known for idol worship. It had a vast empire at that time.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">But at the time that Jesus and John lived on earth, <em>Babylon</em> was only ruins. So it is a symbol here.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>made her drink</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>gave to her and she drank</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the cup of the wine of the fury of His wrath:</strong> The word <em>wine</em> is a metaphor for the <em>fury of His wrath</em>. The <em>cup</em> is part of that metaphor. The metaphor indicates that Babylon will experience the full intensity of God’s anger.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would not indicate the correct meaning.

So the word <em>Come</em> is an invitation for John to accompany the angel. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Come with me. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will show you the punishment of the great prostitute:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>punishment</em> often refers to the decision of a judge about whether someone is guilty or not. It can also refer to the declaration of what the punishment will be. For example, the RSV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>judgment</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In 17:16–17, the angel shows John how the great prostitute is punished. If your word for “judgment” clearly implies here that the prostitute is punished as well, you may want to follow the RSV.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The noun <em>punishment</em> refers to that event. In some languages it is more natural to use a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will show you how the great prostitute <u>will be punished</u>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will show to you <u>how God will punish</u> the great prostitute.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>great:</strong> Here this word means “important” or “well-known.” It does not mean that the woman was large or fat. It does not indicate that the woman was good or had good character. The context implies that she was a bad person. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>notorious (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>famous (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>prostitute:</strong> This word refers to a woman who has sexual relations for money. A prostitute often entices men to have sexual relations with her.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here the word is a metaphor for an evil and powerful city. Like a prostitute, this evil city enticed the kings of the earth. But in this case it enticed them to live in luxury with her and to worship idols with her. The English versions translate this word literally here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>harlot (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>whore (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Be careful to use a word or phrase that is not vulgar. Use a word that can be read aloud in church without people being embarrassed by the word.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages people will not understand the meaning of the metaphor. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will show you how the famous <u>prostitute</u> is to be punished, <u>that great city</u>… (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Include a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This word refers to an evil and powerful city.

It controlled the trade on these rivers. This was true of the city of Babylon at the time when it was a powerful city. At that time, most goods were carried by ship, so being near rivers meant that the city had power over trade there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would not indicate the figurative meaning of the word <em>on</em>.

It is emphasized in the Greek by putting it at the beginning of the sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>With her the kings of the earth committed adultery (NIV11)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages must put the phrase <em>with her</em> after the verb, as the BSB does.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>The kings of the earth:</strong> This phrase refers to the leaders of nations around the world.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>were immoral:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>were immoral</em> refers generally to having sexual relations with someone who is not one’s spouse. It refers to both married and unmarried people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In your culture, you may use a euphemism for this Greek word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>slept with women who was not their spouses</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>did wrong with women who were not their wives</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The word or phrase you use should be acceptable for reading aloud in public.

They were happy to be seduced by this woman. She lured them through offers of riches and power.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would not indicate the figurative meaning of <em>were immoral</em>. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate the meaning without the figure of speech.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Her immoral ways have intoxicated the earth’s inhabitants</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>were intoxicated:</strong> This phrase refers to being drunk, in this case from wine.

The woman had the symbolic name “Babylon.” An angel referred to her as a prostitute. The red beast had seven heads and ten horns. The beast worked together with her, but later he destroyed her.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The great/famous prostitute with the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">symbolic</span> name Babylon <span data-bnType=\"implied\">was destroyed</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The red beast turned against the woman Babylon <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and destroyed her</span></p></blockquote></div><h4>17:3a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"17:3a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Then the angel took/carried me with the help of the Spirit into a wilderness.</p></li><li><p>¶ Then the angel took me under the Spirit’s power into an empty land.</p></li><li><p>¶ Then the angel took me by the Spirit’s power to a desolate/uninhabited land.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>carried me away in the Spirit:</strong> In English Bibles, the titles and names of God normally begin with an uppercase (capital) letter. But ancient Greek writers used only one style of letters. So the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Spirit</em> can refer to either the human spirit or God’s Spirit. There are two ways to interpret it:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It indicates that <u>the Holy Spirit took John places</u> during the following experience. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit (RSV) <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NASB, NABRE, NLT, CEV, NET, ESV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It indicates that <u>John’s spirit</u> (as opposed to his physical body) <u>experienced</u> the following event. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He took me in spirit (NJB) <em>(NJB, NRSV, REB, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because it is probably used in the same way as in 1:10. See how you translated the phrase <em>in the Spirit</em> there. The clause implies that John’s experience in 1:10 continues, but at a new location.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>wilderness:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>wilderness</em> refers to a place that is empty, desolate, or uninhabited. See how you translated this word in 12:6 or 12:14.</p><h4>17:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"17:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>where I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>There I saw a woman sitting on a red beast</p></li><li><p>I saw a/that woman there sitting on a bright red monster.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a woman:</strong> This woman was referred to as “the great prostitute” in 17:1. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer to a different woman. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Clearly indicate in your translation that it is the same woman. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that woman</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Explain who she is in a footnote.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that had names insulting to God written all over it (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>blasphemous names:</strong> The word <em>blasphemous</em> here means “a saying that is against God.” The beast was perhaps using the names and titles that are rightfully God’s alone. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>names that dishonored God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>names that belong to God alone</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated the phrase “blasphemous name” in 13:1.</p><h4>17:3d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"17:3d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and had seven heads and ten horns.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and having seven heads and ten horns.</p></li><li><p>It had seven heads and ten horns.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>had seven heads and ten horns:</strong> You should translate this phrase as you did in 13:1.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>horns:</strong> This word refers to horns like animal horns.

Purple cloth was very expensive at that time. It was worn only by the most important officials.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Scarlet cloth was also somewhat expensive at that time. It was worn only by the very wealthy or by military leaders.

This showed how wealthy she was. Other ways to translate these words are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>adorned with gold and jewels and pearls (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>was decorated all over with gold and valuable stones and pearls</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>gold:</strong> The word <em>gold</em> refers to a rare metal of a somewhat yellow color. It was the most expensive metal at that time. It is naturally shiny and beautiful. See how you translated this word in 1:12 or 9:20.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>precious stones:</strong> This phrase refers to rare stones that are naturally beautiful or become beautiful when shaped and polished. These rare stones are <em>precious</em> or expensive. The RSV translates this phrase as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>jewels</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The foundation of the new Jerusalem is made of 12 different <em>precious stones</em>. See the descriptions and pictures of those kinds of <em>precious stones</em> in the notes at 21:19–20.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>pearls:</strong> The word <em>pearls</em> refer to hard, shiny spheres up to 10 millimeters (half an inch) across. They are found in the shellfish called oysters. Pearls are often very beautiful. Good ones are very valuable.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages do not have a word for <em>pearls</em>. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use the major language word. You may then want to explain it in your translation or in a footnote. Some examples for explaining in your translation are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">beautiful</span> pearls</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">expensive things called</span> pearls <em>An example footnote is:</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A pearl is a hard, shiny sphere about 5–10 millimeters across.

You may then want to include a footnote that explains the original word. An example is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Literally: “pearls.” A pearl is a hard, shiny sphere about 5–10 millimeters across. It is found in a kind of shellfish called the oyster.

If this is true in your language, translate naturally. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>She <u>had</u> a golden cup in her hand (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>She was holding a gold cup</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>golden:</strong> The word <em>golden</em> indicates that the cup was made of <u>gold</u>.

These are things/deeds that God detests. The phrase refers to the results of the woman’s disgusting sexual practices. Those are again a figurative reference to the shameful things she did with the kings of the earth and its inhabitants (17:2). Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>unclean things of her immorality (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the impurities of her immorality (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the foul things/practices of her sexual sins</p></blockquote>",

The name was mysterious or secret. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>on her forehead a name was written, a mystery, (NASB) <em>(BSB, RSV, GNT, NJB, NIV11, NASB, NABRE, NLT, CEV, NET, REB, NCV, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It <u>is itself part of the name or title</u>.

The clause is passive. Some languages must use an active or intransitive clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">someone</span> had written a name on her forehead</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>On her forehead were these words:</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>A name/title was on her forehead:</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you translate following the last two examples, your translation should imply that the title was written.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>mysterious:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>mysterious</em> refers to truth or knowledge that people have not discovered on their own. Someone else reveals it to them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The name is told in 17:5b–c. So the mystery is probably that this particular name had not been told before. It is not explained here. People will have to read the name and try to understand its meaning. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a name of mystery: (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a name that has a secret meaning: (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Also see how you translated this word in 1:20.</p><h4>17:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"17:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The Great Babylon, the Mother of Prostitutes</p></li><li><p>The Famous Babylon, The Originator/Source of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">All</span> Prostitutes,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>BABYLON:</strong> The name of this woman is <em>BABYLON</em>.

Here prostitution refers figuratively to worshiping idols and being unfaithful to God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would not clearly indicate the figurative meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate literally and explain its meaning in a footnote.

For example, the NASB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus <em>(BSB, RSV, GNT, NJB, NASB, GW, NET, NABRE, REB, NCV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because the expressions in both 17:6a and 17:6b probably refer to believers who would not renounce Jesus.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Smalley (432) “‘witnesses to Jesus’…do not form a separate group from the…‘saints’.”</span></span> But if the major language version follows interpretation (2), you may want to follow that.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>namely</u>, the blood of those who bore testimony to Jesus</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that is to say, those who testify about Jesus</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>witnesses for Jesus:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>witnesses for Jesus</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The word refers to <u>those who publicly spoke about Jesus and called him their Lord</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the witnesses to Jesus (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those who testify about Jesus (GW) <em>(BSB, NIV, NRSV, NASB, NABRE, NLT, GW, NET, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The word refers to <u>those who were faithful to Jesus</u>.

These words probably refer to imitating Jesus’ death and resurrection. The beast will do that to deceive people. Other ways to translate these words are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>is one that used to be and no longer is. It will come back (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>was once alive, but lives no longer; it is about to come up (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>was once alive but isn’t now.

If you translated “once was, now is not” as “once was alive, but now is not,” or similar wording, your translation should imply here that the beast is alive at the time he <em>is about to come up</em>. If it does not imply that, you may want to include that implied information in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>was once alive, but lives no longer; it is about to come up <span data-bnType=\"implied\">alive</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>was once alive but isn’t now.

It indicates that the pit or chasm was too deep to measure. Here it probably refers to something underground rather than a chasm.

The word <em>go</em> refers figuratively to the beast’s life as a journey. At the end of his life journey, God will destroy him. But the focus here is on God’s plan to destroy him. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and is destined for destruction</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>only to meet with destruction (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and will only live until God destroys him</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The noun <em>destruction</em> refers to an event. In some languages it is necessary or more natural to use a verb for this event. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but only to be destroyed (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will destroy him</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>go:</strong> The future tense phrase “about to” is implied from 17:8b but not repeated here.

It should be translated in the same way as in 13:8. See how you translated this phrase there.</p><h4>17:8g</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"17:8g\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that was, and is not, and yet will be.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because he once was, now is not, but will again exist/live <span data-bnType=\"implied\">on earth</span>.</p></li><li><p>For the monster lived once, now is dead, yet will be there <span data-bnType=\"implied\">alive</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that was, and is not:</strong> These words have the same meaning as in 17:8a. Translate them in the same way here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and yet will be:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>be</em> is literally “be present.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It was once alive; now it no longer lives, but it will <u>reappear</u> (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>this beast that used to be and no longer is, but will <u>be</u> once more (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the beast, which once was alive, and is alive no longer, and has still to <u>appear</u> (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and:</strong> There is implied contrast between the three clauses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but (NET)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 17:8d–g</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">There are four things said here that relate to one another:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Some people’s names were not written in the Book of Life.</p></li><li><p>That Book of Life was written before the beginning of the universe.</p></li><li><p>Those people will be amazed at the beast.</p></li><li><p>The beast once was, now is not, and yet will be present.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is more natural to put some of that information into one or more sentences.

It can also refer to a whole country, which may have many people groups within it. In the plural, <em>peoples</em>, it refers to a number of those groups. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>nations (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>multitudes:</strong> This word refers to large groups of people. It is often translated as “crowds.” But probably larger groups are meant here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>populations (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>nations:</strong> This word refers to whole people groups. They may be grouped by culture, language, or nationality.

(2) A few late Greek manuscripts have the text <u>the ten horns you saw upon the beast</u> (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1), because the UBS Greek NT supports it.</span></span> The Greek phrase is literally “the ten horns that you saw and the beast.” John had already seen the beast. This phrase emphasizes the fact that John had already seen the ten horns. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the ten horns that you saw, they and the beast (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the ten horns:</strong> This phrase refers figuratively here to the ten kings. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer only to the beast’s ten horns, not the ten kings.

They will take Babylon’s possessions and her clothes. But it also describes her in a figurative way as being alone and shamed. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They will take all her possessions and clothes from her</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They will strip her naked and leave her destitute (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They will take everything she has and leave her naked (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>They will leave her desolate:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>leave her desolate</em> refers here to being left with nothing.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He shouted with a powerful voice (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>cried out:</strong> The Greek word refers to speaking loudly so that many people can hear the message.</p><h4>18:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"18:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“The great Babylon has fallen, indeed she/it has fallen!</p></li><li><p>“The great <span data-bnType=\"implied\">city of</span> Babylon is in ruins, complete ruins!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great:</strong> The Greek words are literally “The great Babylon fell fell.” The verb “fell” is repeated in order to emphasize it. The BSB emphasizes the verb by repeating it and by placing it first, in poetic style common in English. The GNT emphasizes the verb by using two complete sentences:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>She has fallen! Great Babylon has fallen!<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The pronoun “She” refers to Babylon here.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated these words in 14:8.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Fallen:</strong> Here the word <em>Fallen</em> refers to the result of the beast (and others) destroying the city (17:16).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate or imply that the city fell because of some accident. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Explain the implied meaning in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">has been destroyed and so</span> has fallen</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>has been destroyed</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>is finished/gone</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Explain the implied meaning in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This refers to the beast and others destroying the city (17:16) as God planned (17:17).</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Babylon:</strong> <em>Babylon</em> had once been a very powerful city. The city was well known for idol worship. It controlled a vast empire at that time. One of its kings conquered Jerusalem. But at the time of Jesus and John, it was only ruins. So the name <em>Babylon</em> is a symbol here. It refers to a city, country, or empire that opposes God. This could include Rome or a future powerful city. Use the name <em>Babylon</em> here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the great:</strong> The city of Babylon is called <em>the great</em> because it had once been an important and famous city. It had controlled a vast empire and held great influence in that region. See how you translated this phrase in 17:5.</p><h4>18:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"18:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>She has become a lair for demons</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>She/It has become a place where demons live</p></li><li><p>Demons live/dwell in her/it,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>She:</strong> This pronoun refers to the city of Babylon. 18:2c–d describes it. 18:3a–c continues to use the metaphor of a woman for the city.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a lair for demons:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>lair</em> refers to a location where someone or something lives. The <em>demons</em> live in the ruins of Babylon. People are no longer living there. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a dwelling place of demons (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a lair for demons (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>demons:</strong> This word refers to evil spirit beings. The word <em>demons</em> does not refer to the spirits of dead people.</p><h4>18:2d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"18:2d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and a haunt for every unclean spirit, every unclean bird, and every detestable beast.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and a place where every unclean spirit, every foul/vile and hated bird takes refuge, and a place where every foul/vile and hated animal takes refuge.</p></li><li><p>and all kinds of evil spirits and loathsome, disgusting birds and animals live <span data-bnType=\"implied\">there</span> watching <span data-bnType=\"implied\">over her/it</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>haunt:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>haunt</em> refers to a place where an evil spiritual being lives. It probably includes the sense of guarding something. The demons probably watch over the ruins of Babylon and resent anyone trying to enter. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>refuge</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>place of watching/guarding</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>unclean spirit:</strong> The BSB literally represents the Greek of this phrase. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>foul spirit (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>filthy spirit (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>unclean spirit</em> is a Hebrew idiom that refers to the spirit being sinful. A sinful spirit is <u>religiously unclean</u> and, therefore, unable to stand before God. An unclean spirit has rebelled against God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages translating <em>unclean spirit</em> literally would not have the meaning above. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Literally: “unclean spirit.” The phrase “unclean spirit” is a Hebrew idiom that refers to the spirit being sinful. A sinful spirit is religiously unclean and, therefore, unable to stand before God.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>spirit:</strong> The word <em>spirit</em> refers to a being that is usually not seen. Angels and demons are spirits.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>every unclean bird, and every detestable beast:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>every</em> here probably means “many different kinds.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>all kinds of</u> filthy and hateful birds (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>unclean bird:</strong> In the Old Testament, writers referred to these kinds of birds as living in desolate or deserted places (Isaiah 34:11, Jeremiah 50:39). In Jewish culture, these birds were symbolic of demons. You may want to explain that implied meaning in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In the Old Testament, writers referred to these kinds of birds as living in desolate or deserted places (Isaiah 13:20–21, 34:10–11, Jeremiah 50:39). In Jewish culture, these birds were symbolic of demons.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>unclean:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>unclean</em> means “defiled” or “desecrated.” It can also have the figurative meaning of “unfit before God” here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>foul (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>filthy (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>vile/nasty</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>disgusting<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Uma Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and every detestable beast:</strong> There is a textual issue here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some versions include these words. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a haunt for every unclean and detestable beast (ESV) <em>(BSB, NIV11, ESV, NRSV, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Some versions do not include these words. <em>(RSV, NIV84, GNT, NJB, NASB, KJV, REB)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1), because the Greek NT 4 includes them.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>But they indicate that they had difficulty in deciding which text is correct. They include it with brackets around the phrase. Beale (page 895) says, “a scribe’s eye inadvertently skipped from one phrase beginning with “and a prison of every”…to the next phrase beginning with the same words.” So it is missing from many manuscripts.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>detestable:</strong> This word refers to things that people hate or avoid.

It is not clear to whom the voice spoke. He used four different commands. Two commands urge them to give her a punishment that is equal to her sin. Two commands urge them to give her double the punishment. The four commands together urge them to <u>fully and completely</u> punish Babylon.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The four commands are all addressed to more than one person or being.

For example, the GW says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Give her <em>(GW, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because the lexicons support it.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Only the L&amp;N have “pour” as a sense of the Greek word, but it lists this verse under the sense of “mix.” Beale, Aune, Hughes, Lenski, Smalley, and Kistemaker also support interpretation (1).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>mix</em> refers here to getting the portion ready for the woman to drink. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>prepare (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>make</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>her:</strong> The BSB omits the word “for” in a natural English style. In many languages, this word must be explicit. For example, the RSV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>for her</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a double portion:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>a double portion</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to <u>twice as much liquid (twice as much wine and water mixed together)</u>.

Here in 18:7a–b the speaker urged them to punish Babylon equal to the glory and luxury that she had given to herself.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>As much as she has glorified herself and lived in luxury, give her the same measure of torment and grief:</strong> The speaker asked his listeners to make her suffering of equal measure to the glory and luxury that she had given to herself. However, in some languages a verb other than <em>give</em> must be used for the correct meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Measure out torment and grief to match her pomp and luxury! (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Punish her with torture and grief as great as the glory and luxury she took for herself!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>See the quantity of her glory and her luxury that she provided/bought for herself? Make the quantity of her torture and grief equal to that.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The BSB reverses the order of the two Greek clauses. See the General Comment at the end of 18:7b.</p><h4>18:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"18:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>As much as she has glorified herself and lived in luxury,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>As she glorified herself and lived in luxury,</p></li><li><p>As much as she exalted herself and bought many fancy/expensive things for herself,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as she has glorified herself:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>glorified</em> is related to the word “glory.” Glory refers to brightness. It symbolizes greatness, power, splendor, and majesty. Babylon was proud and wanted everyone to admire her and be impressed by her greatness. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as the glory…she gave herself (NIV11)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>majesty</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>lived in luxury:</strong> The Greek word here refers to things that satisfy sensual desires. See how you translated the word “luxury” in 18:3.</p><h4>18:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"18:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>give her the same measure of torment and grief.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to the same amount torment her and cause her grief.</p></li><li><p>cause her suffering/pain and grieving just as much.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>give her…torment:</strong> This phrase refers to causing someone to suffer and feel pain. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>cause pain</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Give…torture (NIV84)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>make suffer</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this phrase in 9:5.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>grief:</strong> This word here refers to the distress someone feels when suffering greatly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>agony (NJB)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 18:7a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The Greek has the basis (18:7a) before the command (18:7b), as reflected in the BSB. Some English versions reverse this order. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Give her as much torment and grief as the glory and luxury she gave herself (NIV11)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is necessary or more natural to have the basis first, as modeled by the BSB.</p></div><h4>18:7c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"18:7c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>In her heart she says,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For she proudly says in her heart,</p></li><li><p>For she treasures this thought:</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">18:7c begins with the conjunction often translated as “because.” The conjunction introduces the reason for the speaker urging his listeners to punish her. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>In her heart she says:</strong> Here the phrase <em>In her heart</em> refers to what the woman truly thinks. It indicates that 18:7d–e is her great desire. Use the usual word or phrase that is used in your language to indicate the origin of thoughts, desires, purposes, and intentions. It might be a different organ such as “liver,” or it might be a general word such as “insides.” Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>she boasts to herself in her mind</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>she proudly thinks deep inside</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>says:</strong> The BSB literally represents the Greek here. But the words of 18:7d–e are boastful, so some English versions use the word “boasts” here, as in the NIV.</p><h4>18:7d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"18:7d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>‘I sit as queen;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>‘Here I sit, a queen! (GNT)</p></li><li><p>‘I am queen here on my throne.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I sit as queen:</strong> This clause indicates that the woman had great authority, like a queen. She was proud of her powerful position. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Here I sit, a queen! (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am enthroned as queen (NJB)</p></blockquote><h4>18:7e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"18:7e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I am not a widow and will never see grief.’</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I am not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">helpless/destitute like</span> a widow. I will never suffer!’</p></li><li><p>I am not dependent on others, and I will never grieve.’</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I am not a widow:</strong> The word <em>widow</em> is a metaphor here. The woman claimed she would not be like a woman who has lost her husband. She boasted that she would not be left without anyone to take care of her or that she could take care of herself. Many English versions translate this clause literally. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am no widow (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would not have the figurative meaning above. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Translate the literal meaning and explain its figurative meaning in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The woman claims she will never be helpless and dependent on others, as widows often were when John wrote this book.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the metaphor as a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> a widow</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Explain the meaning in your translation.

For example:</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Literally: “I am not a widow.”</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>see grief:</strong> This word is the same Greek word that the BSB translates as “grief” in 18:7b.

This is an English poetic style. In some languages it is more natural to have the description after. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Lord God, who judges her, is <u>mighty</u> (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>mighty:</strong> This word not only refers to physical strength, but probably also to great authority. God has both the power and authority to judge Babylon.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Lord God who judges her:</strong> The clause <em>who judges her</em> tells the reader more about God. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other gods and only this one <em>judges her</em>. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Lord God. He judges her.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>her judge is the…Lord God (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Lord:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Lord</em> means “the one who has authority over (others),” or “owner.” God has authority over everyone. See how you translated this word in 4:8 or 17:14.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>judges her:</strong> The word <em>judges</em> refers to deciding if someone is guilty or innocent of wrongdoing. The context implies that the Lord judged Babylon to be guilty. So he punished her with death, mourning, and famine (18:8b).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate only that God judged her, but he did not punish her. If that is true in your language, include some of the implied information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>judges/judged her <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in that way</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>judges/judged her <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and punished her with those plagues</span></p></blockquote>",

There are two ways to interpret who spoke or wrote 18:9–20:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p><u>The voice continued to speak here</u>. The voice continued describing what will happen. <em>(NIV, NJB, NASB, GW)</em></p></li><li><p><u>The voice stopped speaking at the end of 18:8d</u>. John then saw the events of 18:9–20 and wrote about them. <em>(BSB, RSV, GNT, NABRE, NLT, CEV, NET, REB, NCV, ESV)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because the future tense continues from 18:8.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Beale (page 905), Swete (page 231), and Caird (pages 224–225) support interpretation (1).</span></span> So 18:9–20 are events that the voice told John about, just like 18:4–8.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Indicate that the voice continues speaking. In some languages introducing the quote again is necessary or more clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The voice continued,</span> “When the kings…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">That person in heaven spoke further saying,</span> “When the kings…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">That person’s voice continued speaking from heaven, saying,</span> “When the kings…</p></blockquote><h4>18:9a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Then the kings of the earth who committed sexual immorality and lived in luxury with her will weep and wail at the sight of the smoke rising from the fire that consumes her:</strong> The kings’ actions are described in two ways here:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>they <em>committed sexual immorality…with her</em>,</p></li><li><p>they <em>lived in luxury with her</em>.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">What the kings actually did <em>at the sight of the smoke</em> is not written until after these descriptions. Your translation should make it clear that (a) and (b) above describe the customary deeds of the kings. You should not translate it as something they only did at this time. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>Regarding</u> the kings of the earth who had committed adultery with her and shared her luxury, <u>when they</u> see the smoke</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When the kings of the earth who had <u>been</u> committing adultery with her and sharing her luxury <u>now</u> see the smoke</p></blockquote><h4>18:9a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"18:9a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Then the kings of the earth who committed sexual immorality</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ When the kings of the earth who were committing sexual sin <span data-bnType=\"implied\">together</span> with her</p></li><li><p>¶ The leaders of the world’s nations had been sinning sexually with her</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">The voice continued,</span> “The kings of the earth <span data-bnType=\"implied\">regularly/always</span> committed adultery with her</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the kings of the earth:</strong> This phrase refers to the leaders of nations around the earth.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who committed sexual immorality:</strong> This clause probably symbolizes the kings as joining Babylon in sinning against God. See how you translated this clause at 17:2 or 18:3.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would not indicate the symbolic meaning of <em>committed sexual immorality</em>. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This saying is probably symbolic of joining Babylon in sinning against God.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">But if you already have a footnote at 17:2a or 18:3b, you may not want to repeat the footnote here.</p><h4>18:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"18:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and lived in luxury with her</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and living with her in luxury</p></li><li><p>and had been enjoying her fancy/expensive things.</p></li><li><p>and shared her luxurious life.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>lived in luxury with her:</strong> The BSB literally represents the Greek here. The kings satisfied their sensual desires together with her. This would include things like rare perfumes, wearing expensive clothing, and eating fancy foods.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>luxury:</strong> The Greek word here refers to things that satisfy sensual desires.

Other ways to translate these words are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>standing at a distance <u>because of</u> the fear of her torment (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>while they keep at a safe distance <u>through</u> fear of her anguish (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>torment:</strong> This word refers to much hurt and pain. The Greek word is the same word as “torment” in 18:7b. But the context here refers to <u>feeling</u> hurt and pain rather than causing hurt and pain. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>anguish (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>suffering (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>cry out:</strong> The Greek word is literally “say” (as in the RSV).

If that is true in your language, you may want to follow interpretation (2).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to say first whom the speakers are addressing.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>Great</u> woe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">indeed</span>!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Woe:</strong> The Greek word here means “There will be trouble for (someone).” The word indicates sorrow about the troubles.

In some languages it is more natural to use a different verb than <em>come</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your judgment has occurred/happened</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You may have translated “O great city, O Babylon, city of power” following interpretation (2) above.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>saying, ‘Woe, woe, the great city, <u>she</u> who was clothed in fine linen… (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Woe, woe to the great city:</strong> The words naming the thing spoken about, <em>the great city</em>, are in the middle of the sentence. Many languages must have <em>the great city</em> first for a natural sentence and place the words <em>Woe, woe</em> at the end of the sentence. Also, many languages must locate the description of that thing immediately after naming the thing spoken to. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>O great city, clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls—woe, woe!</p></blockquote><h4>18:16a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"18:16a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>saying: “Woe, woe to the great city,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and say, “How terrible, so terrible <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for her</span>!

Some other English versions use the phrase “and cry out” to indicate the meaning of “speak with much emotion.” That meaning is implied here. See how you translated the word “cry” in 18:10.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Woe, woe:</strong> The word <em>Woe</em> is repeated to emphasize its meaning. But in some languages it is more natural <u>not</u> to repeat the word. If that is true in your language, you should emphasize the <em>woe</em> in a natural way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Great</u> woe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">indeed</span>!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this phrase in 18:10.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the great city:</strong> The BSB literally represents the Greek here. Some English versions add the word “O” (as in the NIV84). In English it probably indicates a formal address, as speaking to someone of high status. Some English versions, like the BSB, do not add this word.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>great:</strong> The city of Babylon is called <em>great</em> because at that time it was an important and famous city. It had a vast empire and great influence. See how you translated this word in 18:2.</p><h4>18:16b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"18:16b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>clothed in beautiful linen cloth, purple cloth, and scarlet cloth,</p></li><li><p>She <span data-bnType=\"implied\">was like a woman who</span> wore expensive flaxen clothes!

Earlier, John saw Babylon figuratively as a woman (17:1–18).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is not natural to refer to a city as a woman. If that is true in your language, you may want to change this metaphor into a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">she was like a woman</span> clothed in fine linen</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>fine linen:</strong> Here the word <em>fine</em> indicates that the <em>linen</em> was very good quality. See how you translated this phrase in 18:12.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>purple and scarlet:</strong> This phrase refers to the colors of the cloth. Making purple and scarlet cloth was expensive at that time. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>expensive purple and scarlet clothing</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated the words <em>purple</em> and <em>scarlet</em> in 18:12.</p><h4>18:16c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"18:16c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and adorned with gold, jewels, and pearls!</p></li><li><p>decorated with gold, valuable stones, and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">beautiful</span> pearls!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>adorned:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>adorned</em> means “wearing.” A woman wore gold, precious stones and pearls in order to look beautiful.

Here the words may also refer to the noise people make when crying. But it probably does not refer to the loud noise of wailing here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>mourn:</strong> This word refers to being very sad or grieving. The sea captains and other people will be very sad that Babylon is gone. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>grieve</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>have great sorrow</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>cry out:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>cry out</em> refers to speaking loudly with a strong desire to be heard.

She is addressed by “she” in 18:19d. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Alas, alas, that great city (KJV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Woe, woe:</strong> The word <em>Woe</em> is repeated to emphasize its meaning. See how you translated this phrase in 18:16.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>all who had ships:</strong> This phrase refers to the people who owned ocean-going ships. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>every owner of a sea–going ship (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>were enriched by her wealth:</strong> The word <em>by</em> indicates that the shipowners became rich because of selling things to Babylon. She bought many expensive goods. The shipowners made a lot of money from fees for bringing those goods to Babylon on their ships.

Do this if the context implies in your language that 18:19d is the reason for the saying of woe in 18:19c.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in a single hour she has been destroyed:</strong> This is a passive clause, similar to 18:17a. The difference here is that the word <em>she</em> replaces “such great wealth.” Some languages must use an active or intransitive clause.

Osbourne (page 634) indicates with punctuation in his translation that it is not the seafarers.</span></span> For example, in 12:12 a voice from heaven commanded heaven to rejoice. Interpretation (3) is unlikely because it would indicate that the ship captains and the others would weep and mourn the destruction of Babylon and then praise God. Interpretation (2) is unlikely because it is unlikely that John would command heaven to rejoice.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The voice from heaven spoken all of 18:4–20 but John has not referred to it since 18:4. It has also quoted what others have said.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is not clear who is speaking here.

(2) Some later Greek manuscripts have the text <u>the holy apostles</u> (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1), because the UBS Greek NT supports it.</span></span> The Greek clause is literally “Rejoice over her, heaven and saints and apostles and prophets!” The phrase telling who is being addressed (<em>heaven…saints and apostles and prophets</em>) occurs after what is said to them. In some languages it is more natural to say who are being spoken to first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>O heaven, saints, apostles, and prophets</u>, rejoice over her!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Rejoice over her:</strong> This clause indicates that heaven and the others are to rejoice regarding what happened to Babylon. God has judged her and punished her, which was the right thing to do. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Rejoice over her fate (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Rejoice about <span data-bnType=\"implied\">how God has judged</span> her</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>O heaven:</strong> This phrase refers to all those in heaven.

They are <u>representatives or messengers of a higher authority</u>. Here it refers to those sent to other cities with the gospel of Jesus (as were Barnabas and Saul in Acts 13:1–3).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this word are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate the meaning.

The message (often called a “prophecy”) may include a vision, as in Ezekiel 1 and Daniel 8. A message, called a prophecy, may reveal something about past events, current events, or future events. The prophet speaks God’s message to the people or writes it down for their use.

The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>musicians</em> usually refers generally to people who know how to play any musical instrument. Here it may mean “singer.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The music of harps and of <u>human voices</u>, of players of the flute and the trumpet (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>harpists:</strong> The word <em>harpists</em> refers to people who know how to play harps. A harp is a stringed instrument. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people playing harps (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 14:2.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>musicians:</strong> This Greek word refers generally to those who make music, either by singing or with instruments. This word occurs in a list of people playing particular instruments, so it seems more likely that it refers to singers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>singers (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>minstrels (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">(Here the word “minstrel” refers to someone who sings and possibly plays an instrument at the same time.)</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>flute players:</strong> A <em>flute</em> is a tube with holes that the <em>players</em> cover to make music when they blow air over the sharp edge at the end.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">A <em>flute</em> may also be a series of pipes of different lengths that make different notes.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>trumpeters:</strong> The word “trumpet” refers to a musical instrument that was often used to alert people to danger. It was also used to announce important messages. At that time trumpets were made from metal or from animal horns. A <em>trumpeter</em> blows into a trumpet in such a way as to make the trumpet sound.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The particular kind of trumpet is not important here. In some languages people use trumpets made of animal horn, shell, bamboo, or other material. If that is true in your language, you may want to use the word for that kind of trumpet here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages do not have a word for <em>trumpeters</em>. If that is true in your language, you can:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a word for a person who uses a loud instrument, preferably one that someone blows into.</p></li><li><p>Use a method of announcing in your area.</p></li><li><p>Use the major language word for <em>trumpeters</em>.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated the word “trumpet” in 1:10 or 8:2.</p><h4>18:22b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"18:22b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>will never ring out in you again.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>will not be heard in you<sup>(sing)</sup> any more.</p></li><li><p>in that city again.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will never ring out in you again:</strong> The pronoun <em>you</em> refers to the city of Babylon. In some languages it is more natural to refer to the city indirectly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>will never be heard in <u>your/her city</u> again</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>will never be heard in <u>that city</u> again</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Also see note at 18:21c–24b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>will never ring out:</strong> In Greek, this clause is passive.

People will no longer be making things in the city. This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">no one</span> will ever see/find a craftsman of any trade in you again</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>There will be no more skilled craftsmen at work there.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>craftsmen of any trade:</strong> This phrase refers to people who have the ability to make things such as houses, furniture, baskets, or tools. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>craftsmen of every skill (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages do not have a general word for <em>craftsmen</em>. If that is true in your language, you may want to begin with a list of kinds of workers and end with “others.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>housebuilders, basketmakers, or other workers like that</p></blockquote><h4>18:22d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"18:22d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>nor the sound of a millstone be heard in you again.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The sound of a scraping millstone will not be heard in you any more.</p></li><li><p>No one will ever hear people grinding food <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for a meal</span> in that city again.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>nor the sound of a millstone be heard in you again:</strong> This clause indicates that no one will be grinding grain in the city of Babylon after this time. It is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>no one will ever hear the sound of a millstone <span data-bnType=\"implied\">grinding grain</span> in you again</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sound of a millstone:</strong> This phrase refers to the sound of scraping one flat stone against another with wheat between the stones. This action grinds the wheat into flour. Women did this every day. They used the flour to make bread for their families.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages people are not familiar with using stones for grinding grain. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Explain the work that is done with the <em>millstone</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the sound of <u>grinding grain</u> (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a general word for preparing food. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>sound of preparing food <em>You may then want to include a footnote to explain the Greek words. For example:</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Literally: “the sound of a millstone.” A millstone is used to grind grain into flour for bread. At that time, every day people would grind grain.</p></blockquote></li></ul>",

Some English versions allow the context to imply its meaning and so do not translate this conjunction.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>your merchants were the great ones of the earth:</strong> The city’s merchants were the world’s great men in the sense that they were very rich and powerful. The people of the city bought many expensive things. Therefore, the merchants became rich from all that selling. This wealth made them very powerful. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Its merchants were the important people of the world (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your businessmen were the most powerful in the whole world</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>merchants:</strong> This word refers to those who buy, sell, and trade as a job. See how you translated this word in 18:3 or 18:15.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the great ones of the earth:</strong> The merchants were <em>great</em> because they had a lot of wealth and influence over others.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For (JPB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>there was found in her the blood of prophets and saints, and of all who had been slain on the earth:</strong> There are two ways to interpret who spoke these words:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><u>The angel who began speaking in 18:21 continues speaking here</u>.

If possible, emphasize this phrase.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some English versions, the verb phrase <em>there was found</em> occurs before the subject (<em>blood</em>). This is an English poetic style that also emphasizes the verb phrase. In the Greek, the verb is not emphasized. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The blood of prophets, God’s people, and everyone who had been murdered on earth was found in it (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In your streets flowed the blood… (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause indicates that the city was responsible for killing prophets, saints, and all others who were killed. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You are guilty of the death… (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is passive. Some ways to translate it are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a passive clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In her was seen the blood</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has found her responsible for the blood…</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a verb that implies that God considered her to be responsible.

In 18:23a–d the angel used the second person pronoun “you.” In some languages it is more natural to continue using the second person. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Or you may have continued to use the pronoun “she” in 18:23a–d, based on how you translated 18:21c–d. If that is true, continue using “she/her” here. Also see note on 18:21c–24b.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>of prophets and saints:</strong> The <em>prophets</em> are <em>saints</em> who have the gift of prophecy. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>prophets and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other</span> saints</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>prophets:</strong> A <em>prophet</em> is a person to whom God gives a message. The message may include a vision, as in Ezekiel 1 and Daniel 8. The message, called a prophecy, may reveal something about past events, current events, or future events. The prophet speaks God’s message to the people or writes it down for their use. See how you translated this word in 18:20.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>saints:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>saints</em> means “holy ones.” It refers to all believers.

The crowd said about believers, “He has avenged the blood of His servants” (19:2d), and “His bride has made herself ready” (19:7d). It seems more natural for angels to say this than believers. But the crowd in 19:6–8 could be different from the crowd in 19:1–2. So the crowd in 19:1–2 could be believers. The text is not clear if they are different or not.</span></span> Your translation should allow this phrase to refer to either people or angels, or both.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>heaven:</strong> Here the word <em>heaven</em> refers to the place where God lives.</p><h4>19:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"19:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>shouting: “Hallelujah!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>saying, “Alleluia!</p></li><li><p>They were shouting, “Praise<sup>(plur)</sup> God!</p></li><li><p>The multitude was yelling, “Let us all praise God!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>shouting:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>shouting</em> is literally “saying.” The BSB uses the word <em>shouting</em> because John indicated it was loud (19:1a). Use the verb that is natural in your language to describe people talking loudly.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Hallelujah:</strong> This Hebrew word means “praise Yah(weh).” Yahweh is God’s name based on Exodus 3:14. The word occurs often in Psalms 113–118. For example, see Psalm 113:1, where the BSB translates it as “Praise the Lord.” Other ways to translate this word are:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Spell the Hebrew word as people in your language would say it. People in your area may already use this word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Alleluia (NJB) <em>You may then want to explain the meaning of the word in a footnote. An example footnote is:</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This Hebrew word means “praise Yah(weh).” Yahweh is God’s name based on Exodus 3:14.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This Hebrew word means “praise God.”</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate only the meaning of this word.

(2) A few later Greek manuscripts have the text <u>honor and power</u> (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1), because the UBS Greek NT supports it.</span></span> The Greek phrase is literally “Salvation and glory and power <u>of</u> our God.” It acknowledges God’s <em>Salvation and glory and power</em>. God has saved his people, and he has glory and power. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Our(incl) God has brought <span data-bnType=\"implied\">us</span> salvation! Our God has glory and power!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Let us acknowledge our God who is glorious, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who is</span> powerful, and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who</span> saved <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his people</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Salvation:</strong> This word refers to rescuing someone from hell, death, harm, or danger. Here God has rescued his people from Babylon. The word <em>Salvation</em> is a noun that refers to an event. In some languages it is more natural to use a verb here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>saving/freeing by God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of his people</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for God to save mankind/us(incl)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>saving from death</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 7:10 or 12:10.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>glory:</strong> This word refers to brightness. It symbolizes greatness, power, splendor, and majesty. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>splendor</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>radiance</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to translate this noun as an adjective. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Our(incl) God is glorious!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 4:9.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>power:</strong> This word refers to the ability to cause things to happen. It does not refer only to physical strength. In some languages it will be more natural to translate this word as an adjective. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Our(incl) God is powerful!</p></blockquote>",

He always judges the wrongdoer to be guilty. Some English versions have the description before what was described. This is an English poetic style. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>true and just are his judgments (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, in some languages it is more natural to have the description afterward, as the BSB models. See how you translated this clause in 16:7.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>judgments:</strong> This word refers to decisions that God makes about whether someone is guilty of sin or not. God judged Babylon as guilty of many sins. In some languages it is necessary or more natural to translate this noun as a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He judges/decides</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>true:</strong> Here the word <em>true</em> refers to God’s judgments being accurate. They are not mistaken or wrong.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>just:</strong> Here the word <em>just</em> refers to judging rightly.

Translate this word so that it allows either of these connections. For example, the NASB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is necessary or more natural not to translate the conjunction. Do this if the context will imply the correct connection in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>judged:</strong> The Greek word here implies that God has judged the prostitute to be guilty, and he has punished her. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>punished (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>great:</strong> This word means “important” or “well-known” here. The word does not refer to a large or fat woman. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>notorious (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>famous</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>infamous</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this in 17:1.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>prostitute:</strong> This word refers to the symbolic woman who is named “Babylon” in 17:5. A prostitute often entices men to have sexual relations with her. Translate this word as you did in 17:1 or 17:15.</p><h4>19:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"19:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who corrupted the earth with her immorality.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>who made the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">whole</span> earth immoral because of her sexual sins.</p></li><li><p>She ruined the morals of all mankind with her <span data-bnType=\"implied\">seductive</span> sinning <span data-bnType=\"implied\">against God</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who corrupted the earth with her immorality:</strong> This clause tells the reader more about the great prostitute. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other great prostitutes and only this one <em>corrupted the earth with her immorality</em>. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about the great prostitute. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>She corrupted the earth with her immorality.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>corrupted the earth with her immorality:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>corrupted</em> refers to ruining someone’s morals or to seducing a virgin. The word <em>earth</em> refers to mankind here. The great prostitute, Babylon, encouraged and enticed the people of the world to sin against God. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>made the earth evil with her sexual sin (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>ruined the morals of people over the whole earth by her adulteries</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>immorality:</strong> This word refers to sexual immorality of all kinds. This word probably refers to sinning against God in many ways. In particular, it refers to being unfaithful to him by worshiping idols.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because she killed his servants (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His servants:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>servants</em> can also be translated as “slaves.” Here the phrase refers to believers <u>serving</u> God.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>All you his servants, you who fear him, both small and great</u>, praise our God!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>all you who serve Him, and those who fear Him, small and great alike:</strong> These words refer to believers.

They also realize he is all-powerful and can do as he chooses, so they respect him. This is not the type of fear that means “afraid” or “frightened.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages the word <em>fear</em> only means “be afraid.” If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Include the implied meaning of “respect” or “revere” in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Fear <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and respect/revere</span> God</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning of <em>fear</em> as “respect” or “revere.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>have reverence for (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>honor (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>respect</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>small and great alike:</strong> This phrase refers to believers of low status and believers of high status.

For example:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Explain that this is a figure of speech in your translation.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>signifies (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>righteous acts:</strong> The word <em>righteous</em> indicates that the deeds are upright or good in God’s eyes.

In the Bible, the good situation results from God showing favor/kindness to the person. It also indicates that God approves of this kind of person.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This word does not primarily refer to a feeling. However, a person in this good situation will frequently have good feelings such as happiness and joy. Do not use a word that <u>only</u> refers to material prosperity or physical health.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Favored</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>How good it is</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In a good/desirable position <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in God’s eyes</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Shown kindness <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by God</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 1:3 or 16:15.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those who are invited:</strong> The clause <em>who are invited</em> is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has invited</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>invited:</strong> This word refers to God asking all believers to come to this celebration.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>marriage supper:</strong> In Jewish custom, a large meal was part of the wedding celebration. Here, the time of day that the meal will be eaten is not implied or important. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>wedding supper (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the feast celebrating the marriage</p></blockquote><h4>19:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"19:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And he said to me, “These are the true words of God.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He also said, “Those words are the true words of God.”</p></li><li><p>He continued, “That saying is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">indeed</span> God’s true words.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he said to me:</strong> The Greek clause is literally “he says to me.” The pronoun <em>he</em> refers to the same speaker as in 19:9a.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He also told me (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>These are the true words of God:</strong> This clause emphasizes that the words in 19:9b are indeed God’s words and that they are true.

This position showed complete humility before that person and honored him. The word <em>fell</em> implies a quick and complete action. It does <u>not</u> refer to accidentally falling. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I prostrated myself before him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I threw myself down at his feet (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I bowed down at the angel’s feet (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I knelt at the feet of the angel (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated the verb at 19:4 (“fell down”).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>worship:</strong> This word refers to honoring someone or something as sacred/divine.

John was not to prostrate himself before the angel. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not do it! (NIV84)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not worship/honor me</p></blockquote><h4>19:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"19:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I am a fellow servant with you</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I am your<sup>(sing)</sup> fellow slave/servant</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">For</span> I serve God just as you do,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">19:10c is a reason why John should not worship the angel. In some languages it is more natural to clearly indicate it is the reason. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">For</span> I am…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I am a fellow servant with you:</strong> This clause indicates that the angel served God just as John served God. They both did the things that God told them to do. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am a servant together with you (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>fellow servant:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>servant</em> can also mean “slave.” It indicates that the angel did what God told him to do. The difference between “slave” and “servant” is not important here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages do not have a single word for “slave.” If that is true in your language, you may want to refer generally to those who serve God. Or if the word “slave” is not appropriate for believers in your language, you may want to refer generally to those who serve God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>one who serves God as you do</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated the word <em>servant</em> in 10:7 or 15:3.</p><h4>19:10d–f</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the testimony of Jesus…the testimony of Jesus:</strong> This phrase occurs in both 19:10d and 19:10f. It probably has the same meaning in both places. There are two ways to interpret this phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It indicates that <u>believers give their testimony about Jesus</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>bear their witness to Jesus. …those who bear witness to Jesus (REB) <em>(NLT, NABRE, CEV, NET, REB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It indicates that <u>Jesus gave the testimony</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the truth that Jesus revealed (GNT) <em>(GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Many English versions translate the Greek grammar literally as <em>of</em>, as the BSB does. It is not possible to tell which interpretation they follow. You may also translate this phrase in a similar way. But some languages must choose either interpretation (1) or interpretation (2). If that is true in your language, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Beale (page 946) supports interpretation (1).

It refers to both men and women. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your brothers and sisters (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your siblings in believing/faith</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your fellow believers</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who rely on the testimony of Jesus:</strong> This clause tells the reader more about the believers (“your brothers”). In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that only some believers <em>rely on the testimony of Jesus</em>. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about all believers. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They rely on the testimony of Jesus.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>rely on:</strong> Here, the phrase <em>rely on</em> indicates that the believers continue to believe that their testimony about Jesus is true. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>are faithful to</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>have</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>testimony:</strong> The word <em>testimony</em> means “the words spoken about what one saw or knows.” The word <em>testimony</em> is often used when the person speaking is expected to be truthful and accurate. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>witness (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>message (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 12:17 or 17:6 (where the BSB translates it as “witnesses”).</p><h4>19:10e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"19:10e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Worship God!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Worship/Revere/Honor<sup>(sing)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">only</span> God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Worship God:</strong> This command indicates that John should worship only God. He should never worship an angel or anyone else. It was not a command to begin worshiping God at that moment. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Worship only God. (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>19:10f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"19:10f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For the testimony/message of Jesus is the essence/purpose of prophecy.”</p></li><li><p>For true prophecy involves the witness of Jesus.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy:</strong> There are two ways to interpret who spoke:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><u>The angel spoke</u> this clause. <em>(BSB, NIV, NRSV, NASB, NABRE, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, REB, NCV, KJV)</em></p></li><li><p><u>John wrote his own thought</u> here. <em>(RSV, GNT, NJB, ESV)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Aune (page 1014), Osbourne (page 671), and Caird (page 233) include 19:10f in the angel’s speech in their translations.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>For:</strong> This conjunction introduces an explanation about “the testimony of Jesus” (19:10d).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy:</strong> The word “spirit” probably means “essence” or “main principle” here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the testimony of Jesus is the essence of prophecy</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the testimony of Jesus is the main principle of prophecy</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is generally understood in several ways that are close in meaning:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The purpose of prophecy is to testify about Jesus.</p></li><li><p>Anyone telling others about Jesus is, in effect, prophesying to them.</p></li><li><p>Words of true prophecy agree with what Jesus said and did.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate the phrase <em>the testimony of Jesus</em> in a way that is similar in meaning to your translation of that phrase in 19:10d.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>prophecy:</strong> The word <em>prophecy</em> refers to a message that God gives to someone. The message may include a vision, as in Ezekiel 1 and Daniel 8. A <em>prophecy</em> may reveal something about past events, current events, or future events. The prophet speaks the <em>prophecy</em> to the people or writes it down for their use.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages do not have a word for <em>prophecy</em>.

If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about the white horse. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The rider of the horse is called Faithful and True.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>is called Faithful and True:</strong> The words <em>Faithful</em> and <em>True</em> describe the rider. The verb <em>called</em> indicates that the words <em>Faithful</em> and <em>True</em> are used as names.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written: (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>He has a name written:</strong> This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that John was thinking of many false prophets and only this one <em>performed signs</em>. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about the false prophet. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He had performed miraculous signs on the beast’s behalf.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>on its behalf:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>on its behalf</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>in submission to him</u> or <u>for his benefit</u>. The authority of the false prophet came from the first beast. He worked for the beast. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>on the beast’s behalf (NJB) <em>(BSB, NIV, NJB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>in his presence</u>. The false prophet ruled while standing in front of the first beast. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>before him (KJV) <em>(RSV, GNT, NASB, NABRE, REB, ESV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because the false prophet probably will do miracles in many places. He probably will not do miracles only in front of the first beast.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Aune (page 1065) has in his translation: “on his authority.” Osbourne (page 671) also supports interpretation (1). See footnote on this phrase at 13:12a.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this phrase in 13:12, where the BSB includes it in the phrase “of the first beast.”</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>its:</strong> Here this word refers to the beast (19:20a).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>had performed:</strong> Here this word means “did.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>worked (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>signs:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>signs</em> refers to an unusual event that people regard as having some special meaning.

It is that old snake, who is also known as the devil and Satan. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>dragon:</strong> This word refers to a mythical creature something like a huge lizard. This creature was often thought of as breathing fire and having wings. They are usually considered to be much larger than people. Dragons were usually considered to be fierce and dangerous. See how you translated this word in 12:3 or 16:13, or see the notes and illustration at 12:3.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>ancient serpent:</strong> The word <em>ancient</em> indicates that the serpent lived long ago. He has continued to live from then to today. Now he has lived a very long time. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>serpent of that time long ago</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>serpent of ancient times</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this phrase in 12:9.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>serpent:</strong> This is another way to say “snake” in English.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>who is the devil and Satan:</strong> This clause tells the reader more about the phrase “that ancient serpent.” In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other ancient serpents and only this one <em>is the devil and Satan</em>. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about that ancient serpent. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">namely,</span> the devil, or Satan</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>devil:</strong> The Greek word here means “slanderer.” A slanderer is someone who says false things about someone to try to ruin that person’s reputation, name, or status. This word is used like a title for the leader of evil spirits, Satan. Make it clear that this word is used like a title:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>Devil (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate <em>devil</em> are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a local name or idiom that refers to the chief of all demons. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Barking One</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a descriptive phrase.

The Hebrew word means “enemy” or “opponent.” It is used as a proper name in the New Testament. This name in Greek is spelled <em>Satanas</em>. So you should also spell the name in your language like the Greek or the major language version.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>tied him up (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for a thousand years:</strong> The thousand years begin at this time. Immediately after tying Satan, the angel threw him into the Abyss (20:3a). Your translation should indicate that the thousand years begin at this time.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>a thousand:</strong> The Greek phrase uses the number word as the BSB does. There are several ways to translate this meaning:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Use number words. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>one thousand</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use numerals. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>1,000</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use number words or phrase for “thousand” from the major language.

Your translation should allow any kind of being to be the judges. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And I saw thrones, with appointed judges seated upon them (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then I saw thrones, and those who sat on them were given the power to judge (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Next I saw thrones.

A throne represents that authority. See how you translated this word in 19:4. But here, your translation should refer to the chairs of the judges, not the chairs of kings or other leaders.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>those seated on them had been given authority to judge:</strong> This clause is passive.

Use the usual word for this part of a person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those who had been beheaded:</strong> This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. The beast or one of his followers had beheaded the believers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those whose heads <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the beast</span> had cut off</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">others/enemies</span> beheaded</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>beheaded:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>beheaded</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to <u>cutting off the head of someone</u>. For example, the GW says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>heads had been cut off <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, NJB, NASB, KJV, ESV, NABRE, NLT, CEV, NET, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to <u>any kind of killing someone</u>. For example, the NCV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>killed <em>(GNT, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because the lexicons support it and not interpretation (2).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Aune, Swete, and Kistemaker also support interpretation (1).

It is the message from God to people. The believers believed this <em>word of God</em>. They probably also told it to others.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is necessary to explain what was done with <em>the word of God</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they believed</span> God’s message</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they followed</span> God’s word</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this phrase in 6:9.</p><h4>20:4d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"20:4d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and those who had not worshiped the beast or its image,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They had not worshiped/revered the beast or its image/statue</p></li><li><p>They had not worshiped/honored the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">first</span> monster or the statue of/representing him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and those who had not worshiped the beast or its image:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>and those who</em> is literally “and who.” There are two ways to interpret the Greek phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It <u>continues talking about those who had been beheaded</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and who had not worshiped the beast or its image (RSV) <em>(RSV, NIV, GNT, NABRE, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, REB, NCV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It <u>introduces a new group of people</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and those who refused to worship the beast or his statue (NJB) <em>(BSB, NJB, NASB, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Aune (page 1088) says, “It is more natural to construe the text as referring to a single group.” Mounce (on TW, 20:4) says, “Those who find two groups…have difficulty explaining the fact that in 13:15 John wrote that the first beast was enabled to ‘cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed.’”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>worshiped:</strong> This word refers to honoring someone or something as sacred/divine. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>venerated</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>revered</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 13:4 or 19:20.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>its image:</strong> This word refers to a statue.

In some languages it is more natural to introduce this clause with the word “or.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>or received its mark on forehead or hand (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>mark:</strong> This word refers to any kind of sign or symbol that is easily seen. These verses do not say how the mark was placed on the hand or forehead. See how you translated <em>mark</em> in 13:16 or 19:20.</p><h4>20:4f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"20:4f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And they came to life</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They returned to life</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God caused</span> them to live again.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And they came to life:</strong> It is implied that God caused them to live again. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly imply that they returned to life by their own power. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Translate the literal meaning and explain in a footnote that God caused them to live again. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God caused them to live again.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Explain in your translation that God caused them to live again.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>all the way across the earth (CEV) <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NASB, NABRE, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, ESV, NCV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to <u>the country of Israel</u>.

The vast army approaching God’s people would be very spread out. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>breadth (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>surface</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>spread over</u> the earth</p></blockquote><h4>20:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"20:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and surrounded the camp of the saints, the beloved city.</p></li><li><p>and surrounded the camp of God’s people, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">which is</span> the city that he loves.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the camp of the saints and the beloved city:</strong> The Greek words are literally “the camp of the saints <u>and/even</u> the beloved city.” Here, the Greek conjunction meaning “and/even” probably introduces an explanation of the phrase <em>the camp of the saints</em>. In other words, <em>the camp of the saints</em> <u>is</u> <em>the beloved city</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the camp of the saints, which is the beloved City (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>camp:</strong> This word refers to a place where a group of people live temporarily, often with some of them prepared, like soldiers, to defend the whole group. Many scholars connect this word to the encampment of the Israelites in the wilderness, as in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Greek word can also mean “a military camp” or “an army.” It is not clear how much of the military theme is intended here.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the saints:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>the saints</em> is literally “holy ones.” The BSB usually translates the Greek word as “saints.” See how you translated this word (“saints”) in 19:8.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the beloved city:</strong> The Greek phrase is literally “the city having been loved.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the city he loves (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">These verses do not say who loves this city but they imply that God loves it. In some languages it is necessary or more natural to indicate who loves this city. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the city that he loves (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the city God loves (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some scholars (Aune, Beckwith, Osbourne) see this phrase referring to the earthly Jerusalem, some (Beale, Charles) to the heavenly Jerusalem, and others (Swete, Kistemaker, Smalley, Johnson, Hughes, Mounce) see it as referring to God’s people as a whole. It is hard to decide.

(2) Some early Greek manuscripts have the phrases <u>from God out of heaven</u> (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1), because the UBS Greek NT recommends it.</span></span> These verses do not say how the fire came down. It is implied that God caused the fire to come down. In some languages it is more natural to indicate that God caused the fire. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God caused</span> fire to come down from heaven</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>consumed them:</strong> Here the word <em>consumed</em> refers to the fire consuming quickly.

But the <em>fire and sulfur</em> were probably mixed together. Sulfur burns readily. Here the phrase has the same meaning as the phrase “the fiery lake of burning sulfur” in 19:20e.

(2) A few later Greek manuscripts have the text <u>I John saw</u> (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1), because the UBS Greek NT supports it.</span></span> The new Jerusalem is <em>the holy city</em> because it belongs to God and God will live there. Here the word <em>holy</em> indicates that the city is dedicated for God’s use. Only his people will live there. Nothing evil will live there. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I saw the City set apart <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for God</span>, which is the new Jerusalem</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I saw God’s <span data-bnType=\"implied\">special</span> City.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other holy cities and only this one was <em>coming down out of heaven from God</em>. If that is true in your language, translate this phrase so that it tells more about the Holy City. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The city came down from God in heaven.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>heaven:</strong> Here the word <em>heaven</em> refers to the place where God lives.</p><h4>21:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"21:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and it was prepared like a bride made beautiful for her husband/man.</p></li><li><p>The city was prepared like a woman adorned for the man she is about to marry.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>prepared as a bride adorned for her husband:</strong> This phrase symbolically compares the new Jerusalem to a woman about to be married. Like a bride makes herself ready for the wedding, so the new Jerusalem is ready to marry.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to translate 21:2b as a separate sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It was prepared like a bride dressed for her husband. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>prepared:</strong> Here the word <em>prepared</em> means “was made ready.” The city was ready in the way that a bride is ready to meet her husband. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>dressed like a bride ready for her husband (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>like a bride dressed in her wedding gown and ready to meet her husband. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">others/they</span> made her ready</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>bride:</strong> This word refers to a woman who is about to marry.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>adorned:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB literally translates as <em>adorned</em> refers to wearing a beautiful dress and jewelry. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>beautifully dressed (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>made beautiful</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>her husband:</strong> Here the word <em>husband</em> refers to the man about to marry his bride.</p>",

But ancient Greek writers used only one style of letters. So the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Spirit</em> can refer to either the human spirit or God’s Spirit. There are two ways to interpret it:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It indicates that <u>the Holy Spirit took John places</u> during the events of 21:10–22:5.

(2) Some later Greek manuscripts have the words <u>great and holy</u> (KJV only).

The glory of God caused the city to shine brilliantly (21:11b–c). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The glory of God made the city bright (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>glory:</strong> This word refers to brightness. It symbolizes greatness, power, splendor, and majesty. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>splendor</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>radiance</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 15:8.</p><h4>21:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"21:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Its radiance was like a most precious jewel, like a jasper,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and its radiance/ brightness was like a most rare jewel, like jasper,</p></li><li><p>so that it gleamed/glittered like a precious stone, like a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">polished</span> jasper <span data-bnType=\"implied\">stone</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>radiance:</strong> This word refers to the brightness of the shining city.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a most precious jewel:</strong> This phrase refers to a rare and beautiful stone.

Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a most rare jewel (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a precious stone (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a valuable gem (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>jasper:</strong> This word refers to a spotted or veined stone of a variety of colors. It is often a reddish color, but it can also be deep green, brown, or deep yellow. It shines brightly in the sun. Light reflects off its surface. Light does not shine through this stone like it does through glass.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages people are not familiar with <em>jasper</em>. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use the name for a kind of stone similar to how <em>jasper</em> is described above. The important thing is that it should be considered bright and beautiful.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a descriptive phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a spotted/veined stone <span data-bnType=\"implied\">named jasper</span></p></blockquote><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use the major language word for the stone. If people are not familiar with this word, explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jasper is a spotted or veined stone that is deep red, green, or yellow. It shines brightly.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 4:3.

John described the city with the words “glory” (21:11a) and “radiance” (21:11b). So the Greek word probably indicates that the city was brilliant and sparkling. It may imply free of impurities. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>with the clear light of crystal (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>dazzling/sparkling like crystal</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Many English versions translate similarly to the BSB. But <em>clear</em> does not seem to be the meaning here. You may want to indicate that the city was like crystal without saying how it was like crystal. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>like crystal</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>crystal:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>crystal</em> refers to various substances that are bright, shiny, and have flat surfaces. (See drawing at 4:6.) The Greek word probably refers only to crystals that let light shine through them. Quartz, diamond, and sapphire are examples of crystals. Here the focus is on the fact that a <em>crystal</em> is shiny. It is not clear if it implies letting light shine through it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages people are not familiar with a <em>crystal</em>. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use the characteristics of a crystal that are important here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>with bright/sparkling surfaces</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>bright/sparkling</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the major language word. If people are not familiar with this word, you may want to explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A crystal is a hard substance that is see-through, shiny, and has flat surfaces.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 4:6.</p>",

The gates themselves are described in 21:21a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>inscribed with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel:</strong> The Greek words are literally “and names having been written, which are the names of the twelve tribes/clans of Israel.” This clause is passive.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as pure as glass (NCV) <em>(BSB, NIV, REB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The phrase indicates the gold is <u>see-through</u>.

The Jews and Jesus used the word “clean” in the same way (Matthew 23:26, Luke 11:41, John 13:10) The gold of the city is completely without dirt or blemish.

The angel again used a metaphor of a bride to describe new Jerusalem. The city was large and beautiful. God lived there with his people. His glory lighted the city. John described the city, the river that flowed through the city, and the tree that gave life. There were no bad things in the city at all.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples for this section heading are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The vision of the new Jerusalem</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>John saw/described the new Jerusalem <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as a bride for the Lamb</span></p></blockquote></div><h4>22:5a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"22:5a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>There will be no more night in the city,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Night/Darkness will no longer exist,</p></li><li><p>There will never be night again.

For example, the GW says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12 </sup>“I’m coming soon! I will bring my reward with me to pay all people based on what they have done. <sup>13 </sup>I am the A and the Z, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>14 </sup>“Blessed are those who wash their robes so that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city. <sup>15 </sup>Outside are dogs, sorcerers, sexual sinners, murderers, idolaters, and all who lie in what they say and what they do.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>16 </sup>“I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give this testimony to you for the churches. I am the root and descendant of David. I am the bright morning star.” <em>(NIV, GW, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>22:12,13 are the words of <u>someone, probably Jesus</u>; 22:14,15 are the words of <u>John</u>; and 22:16 are the words of <u>Jesus</u>. For example, the ESV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12 </sup>“Behold, I am coming soon, bringing my recompense with me, to repay everyone for what he has done. <sup>13 </sup>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.”</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>14 </sup>Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the tree of life and that they may enter the city by the gates. <sup>15 </sup>Outside are the dogs and sorcerers and the sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>16 </sup>“I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify to you about these things for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star.” <em>(BSB, RSV, GNT, NASB, NABRE, ESV, NLT, NET, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>22:12–15 are the words of the <u>angel</u>, and 22:16 are the words of <u>Jesus</u>. For example, the NJB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…holy. <sup>12 </sup>Look, I am coming soon, and my reward is with me, to repay everyone as their deeds deserve. <sup>13 </sup>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End. <sup>14 </sup>Blessed are those who will have washed their robes clean, so that they will have the right to feed on the tree of life and can come through the gates into the city. <sup>15 </sup>Others must stay outside: dogs, fortune–tellers, and the sexually immoral, murderers, idolaters, and everyone of false speech and false life.’</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>16 </sup>I, Jesus, have sent my angel to attest these things to you for the sake of the churches. I am the sprig from the root of David and the bright star of the morning. <em>(NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because there is no sign in the Greek that the speaker changes in 22:14 (interpretation 2), and 22:12–13 are more appropriate coming from Jesus than from the angel (22:9–11).</p><h4>22:12a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"22:12a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Behold, I am coming soon,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ “Look/Listen,<sup>(plur)</sup> I am coming quickly!</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus said,</span> “Indeed/Hey, I will come without delay!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Behold:</strong> This word means “look.” The word emphasizes or calls attention to the words that follow. It is not a command to look at something. See how you translated this word in 22:7.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I am coming soon:</strong> This clause refers to Jesus coming back to his people on earth. The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>soon</em> can also mean “without delay” or “quickly.” See how you translated this clause in 22:7.</p><h4>22:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"22:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and My reward is with Me,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I carry my reward with me (JBP)</p></li><li><p>I will bring with me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">both</span> the rewards and punishments that I will give,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>My reward is with Me:</strong> This clause indicates that Jesus is ready to give a reward. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will bring my reward with me (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>My reward:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>reward</em> refers to both benefits and punishment. If possible, use a word that refers to both. In some languages two words are needed to refer to both benefits and punishment. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>My reward and my punishment</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is necessary or more natural to translate the noun <em>reward</em> as a verb or verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will reward and I will punish</p></blockquote><h4>22:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"22:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to give to each one according to what he has done.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and will give to each person as his deeds deserve.</p></li><li><p>and I will repay every person good or bad according to their good or bad deeds.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to give to each one according to what he has done:</strong> This clause indicates that Jesus will both reward good deeds and punish bad deeds.

It would also indicate that John only wrote about these trees of life and holy city. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it gives more information about them. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span> wrote about those things in this book.</p></blockquote>",

In it, the angel, Jesus, John, and the Holy Spirit spoke some final messages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The angel of 21:9–22:5 affirmed that the book of Revelation is true. Then Jesus reminded the readers that he will return to earth. He also encouraged the readers to believe what was in this book. Then the angel told John to make this message known to other believers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Then Jesus again spoke words of encouragement to believers. The Holy Spirit and the church invited all people to come to Jesus and believe in him. Then John warned everyone not to add any words to this book or remove any part of it. Jesus again reminded the readers that he will return. John agreed and ended the book with a blessing on God’s people.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Ending messages/announcements to endorse/approve the book</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Final words <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to encourage the readers</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jesus, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the angel, the Holy Spirit,</span> and John conclude <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the book</span></p></blockquote></div><h4>22:21</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"22:21\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints.

(2) Some later Greek manuscripts have the text <u>our Lord Jesus Christ</u> (KJV only). It is recommended that you follow option (1), because the UBS Greek NT recommends it.</span></span> There is a textual issue here about the phrase <em>all the saints</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some Greek manuscripts say <u>all</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>everyone (GNT) <em>(GNT, NJB, NASB, NABRE, GW, CEV, NET, REB, ESV, NCV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Some Greek manuscripts say <u>all the saints</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>all the saints (RSV) <em>(BSB, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Some Greek manuscripts say <u>the saints</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s holy people (NLT) <em>(NIV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1), because the UBS Greek NT supports it, saying that option is nearly certain.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The whole clause is a blessing of farewell. John blessed his readers by expressing his desire that God would give grace to them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate the whole clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with everyone (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May the Lord Jesus bless all <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of you</span> with his grace</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May all <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of you</span> have the grace/favor of our Lord Jesus</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>grace:</strong> Here this word refers to God being kind to those who do not deserve his kindness. God is kind to people because he wants to be kind and not because they earned his kindness. John wanted God to show <em>grace</em> to his readers. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>kind (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>help</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>favor</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is necessary to translate <em>grace</em> using a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>voluntarily/graciously be kind</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>help <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as a gift/favor</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Amen:</strong> There is a textual issue here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some Greek manuscripts <u>do not have the word</u>. <em>(GNT, NABRE, NLT, CEV, NET, REB)</em></p></li><li><p>Some Greek manuscripts <u>have the word</u>.

But if the major language version follows option (2), you may want to follow that.</p>",
