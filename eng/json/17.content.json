Benjamin was Jacob’s youngest son.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish:</strong> Jair, Shimei and Kish were ancestors of Mordecai. Hebrew used the term “son of” in the more general sense of “descendant of,” so some commentators think Shimei and Kish were famous ancestors of Mordecai who had lived many years before him. For example, Shimei is mentioned in 2 Samuel 16:5; and the father of King Saul, the first king of Israel, was called Kish (see 1 Samuel 9:1–2). GNT translates it in this way. However, this verse must be considered with the comments on 2:6 below, which seem to suggest that it is a literal “son of” which was meant here.</p>",

For example, the NCV has:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>many of them lay down on rough cloth and ashes <em>(BSB, NCV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The expression means to “put on,” in the same way as Mordecai did in 4:1b. So the people acted in the same way as Mordecai. For example, the GW has:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Many put on sackcloth and ashes <em>(GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p><em>lay in sackcloth</em> means to lie down wearing sackcloth. However <em>lay in…ashes</em> means to lie down on ashes.

Esther sent him other clothes but he refused to wear them. She then sent a messenger to find out why he was behaving in this way. Mordecai gave the messenger a copy of the decree to show to Esther, and he pleaded with her to go and ask the king not to destroy the Jews. Esther hesitated, but finally agreed, although it was dangerous for her to approach the king in this way and she might be killed.</p></div><h4>4:16a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:16a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Go and assemble all the Jews who can be found in Susa, and fast for me.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“Assemble all the Jews who live in Susa.

All five clauses in this verse are connected by the simple Hebrew conjunction translated as “and.” There is no further indication how <em>rid themselves of their enemies</em> is related to the clauses which precede it and the one which follows it. So different versions have chosen different grammatical structures and punctuation to show the relationship between the clauses. There are two main interpretations:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Killing their enemies was the way in which the Jews got relief from their enemies, as in the GNT:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They rid themselves of their enemies by killing seventy-five thousand people who hated them <em>(GNT, NJPS, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Jews gathered together to protect themselves and to kill their enemies, as in the NCV:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Jewish people in the king’s empire also met to protect themselves and get rid of their enemies <em>(BSB, GW, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Both structures are possible from the Hebrew. The Display follows GNT and is the recommended interpretation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>rid themselves of:</strong> The Hebrew verb which the BSB translates as <em>rid themselves of</em> could be translated “get rid of” or “free themselves from.”</p><h4>9:16c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:16c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but they did not lay a hand on the plunder.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>However, they <span data-bnType=\"implied\">too</span> did not take for themselves anything belonging to the people they had killed.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but they did not lay a hand on the plunder:</strong> This is again the same phrase as in 9:10b.

These Notes give some of the reasons for the differences.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>along with Mordecai the Jew:</strong> Some commentators and English versions change the place of this phrase in the verse (see, for example, NJPS, CEV, REB) or omit it altogether (JB, which follows the LXX). However, it is recommended that you follow the BSB, which is the majority view and the clearest way of understanding the Hebrew text.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with full authority:</strong> The Hebrew word which the BSB translates “authority” literally means “strength, power.” Here it is referring to the authority Esther had as queen.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to confirm this second letter:</strong> This is a very difficult expression to understand. It seems clear from the context that <em>this second letter</em> refers to the letter Esther (and Mordecai) were now writing. The first letter was, then, the letter Mordecai wrote in 9:20. This is the view of most commentators. It is difficult, however, to understand how a letter can confirm itself. It would make more sense if this letter was written to confirm the letter which Mordecai had written (in 9:20). This is how a number of versions have translated it (GNT, NCV, NJPS). If a literal translation of this phrase would be difficult to understand in your language, you could follow one of these versions. See, for example, the NCV:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they wrote to prove the first letter was true</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Purim:</strong> See note on 3:7b.</p>",

The Jews were in the habit of commemorating certain traumatic events in their history by holding annual fasts. So this verse is saying that they should establish this holiday (Purim) just as they had established these other holidays.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>1 Scholars differ in how they believe this phrase should be connected grammatically to the rest of the verb and whether they believe this phrase refers to Purim itself or to other holidays which the Jews celebrated. Many English versions are unclear. The majority interpretation is the one discussed in the Notes. It is followed by NJPS, NIV, RSV, GW and GNT and takes the phrase “times of fasting and lamentation” as the object of the verb which the BSB translates “established.” The JB follows a different interpretation which believes that the verse says that fasting and lamentation were to be included in the way Purim was to be celebrated. So the JB has “with additional ordinances for fasts and lamentations.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>fasting:</strong> See note on 4:3b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>lamentation:</strong> This refers to pleading with God for something with tears, not to mourning for the dead.</p>",
