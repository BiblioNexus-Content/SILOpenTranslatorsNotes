The author of a letter wrote his name first, and then he wrote the name of the person to whom he was writing the letter. After that, he wrote a greeting to the person or group to whom he was writing.</p></div><h4>1:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">This letter is from me,</span> Paul. God wanted/chose me to be an apostle of Christ Jesus</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am</span> Paul. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am writing this letter to you</span>. God wanted/chose to send me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to tell people the message</span> about Christ Jesus.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus:</strong> Paul began this letter to Timothy by stating his own name first. Then he said something about himself. In some languages, it is not natural or possible for a person to talk about himself using the third person. You may not be able to say, “This letter is from Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus.” If this is the case in your language, you can say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This letter is from me,</span> Paul. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am</span> an apostle of Christ Jesus.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I,</span> Paul, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">am writing this letter. I am</span> an apostle of Christ Jesus.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>an apostle of Christ Jesus:</strong> The word <em>apostle</em> means “a person whom someone has sent to do a specific job on behalf of that sender.” In 1:1, Paul said that Christ Jesus personally chose and sent him to be his ambassador or messenger of the gospel to other people. Paul was to represent Christ Jesus to others. See apostle in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Christ Jesus:</strong> The word <em>Christ</em> is used two ways in the New Testament. In the Gospels, <em>Christ</em> is a title for Jesus. It means “the anointed one.” But later when Paul and the other apostles and disciples wrote the letters to individuals and churches, the word <em>Christ</em> was used as another name for Jesus rather than as a title.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that in this verse Paul referred to <em>Jesus</em> as <em>Christ Jesus</em> instead of “Jesus Christ.” The names <em>Christ Jesus</em> and “Jesus Christ” mean the same thing. In most English translations and other national language translations, “Jesus Christ” and “Christ Jesus” are translated literally and in the same order as they occur in the Greek manuscripts. It is recommended that you do the same thing. However, if you think that the people who will be reading your translation might be confused when they see two different word orders of the names, you may decide to translate <em>Christ Jesus</em> as “Jesus Christ,” which is the more familiar word order. See also Christ in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by the will of God:</strong> The phrase <em>by the will of God</em> means that “God wanted Paul to be an apostle.” Paul himself did not decide to become an apostle. Another way of describing <em>the will of God</em> is to say that “God choose Paul to be an apostle.”</p><h4>1:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>according to the promise of life</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">so that I might preach the message that God</span> has promised <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to give eternal</span> life</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He sent me so that I might tell people that God</span> has promised us<sup>(incl)</sup> that we<sup>(incl)</sup>/people may live <span data-bnType=\"implied\">forever</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with him/God</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>according to:</strong> The BSB translates the Greek preposition <em>kata</em> as <em>according to</em>. This word introduces God’s purpose for calling Paul to be an apostle. Some ways to translate this idea are:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use a prepositional phrase as the BSB has done.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1a</sup>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, <sup>1b</sup><u>according to</u> the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a conjunction.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1a</sup>God chose me to be an apostle <sup>1b</sup><u>in order to</u> make known the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a verb, as GNT has done.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1a</sup>God chose me to be an apostle <sup>1b</sup>and <u>sent me</u> to proclaim the promise of life….</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the promise of life:</strong> In the Greek text, the word that the BSB translates as <em>life</em> here refers to spiritual and eternal life, not physical life. God appointed Paul and sent him to many different places to preach the gospel. Paul told the people in these places that God had promised to give them eternal life if they would trust in the Lord Jesus Christ.</p><h4>1:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in Christ Jesus,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>that comes from Christ Jesus.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">because</span> Christ Jesus makes it possible.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God promised to give this eternal life to those who believe</span> in Christ Jesus.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in Christ Jesus:</strong> The phrase “in Christ Jesus” or “in Christ” occurs many times in Paul’s letters. The BSB, NIV, and RSV always translate it literally. GNT usually translates it as “in union with Christ.” Because this phrase can mean different things in different contexts, you should always decide the best way to translate it in each context. In this verse, the context is <em>life in Christ Jesus</em>. Some ways of translating the entire phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God has promised life <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that has its source</span> in Christ Jesus</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God has promised life <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that is possible</span> because of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what</span> Christ Jesus <span data-bnType=\"implied\">has done</span></p></blockquote>",

In some languages it is necessary to say: “I am writing to you, Timothy….”</p><h4>1:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>my beloved child:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You are like</span> a dear son to me.</p></li><li><p>I love you as <span data-bnType=\"implied\">much as I would love</span> my own son.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>my beloved child:</strong> Timothy was not Paul’s child in the physical sense of that word. But Paul referred to Timothy several times as his “child.” This is perhaps because Paul had been responsible for Timothy’s spiritual conversion. If the people reading your translation only understand this phrase literally, you may want to say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">you are like</span> a beloved child to me</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">it is as if you are</span> my dear son</p></blockquote><h4>1:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I pray that</span> God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">our<sup>(incl)</sup></span> Father and Christ Jesus our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord will be kind to you, treat you with compassion, and grant you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">inner</span> peace.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord:</strong> This phrase was a common way for Christians to greet each other during the time when Paul lived. It is a sort of prayer or blessing. Paul was asking God to bless Timothy. You may need to begin this blessing with a verb clause such as “I pray that God will give you…” or “I ask God to give you….”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Grace:</strong> The authors of the New Testament letters often used the word <em>Grace</em> in their greetings at the beginning of their letters. It is used to express their desire that God would bless the people who received the letter or to wish them well. <em>Grace</em> means that God favors people or that he is kind to people even though they do not deserve it. See grace in the Glossary, Meaning 1.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>mercy:</strong> The Greek word that English versions translate as <em>mercy</em> means that God treats us kindly or with compassion, or that he pities us. See mercy in the Glossary, Meaning 1.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>peace:</strong> The Greek word that is translated <em>peace</em> here refers to the satisfaction we have in our innermost beings because we are in a harmonious relationship with God. This peaceful relationship is possible because he has forgiven our sins, and he causes us to live without having anxiety and fear. In this verse, <em>peace</em> is not referring to a person being at peace with other people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>God the Father:</strong> You may need to translate this phrase as “God our (incl) Father” if that is the natural way to say this phrase in your language.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:2c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Your language may usually require that you translate each of these nouns with a clause, rather than a single word. However, when translating greetings, you may want to use something shorter. In 1:2c, Paul was giving Timothy greetings, not teaching him about <em>grace, mercy,</em> and <em>peace</em>. Therefore it may not be necessary to include all the elements that are normally associated with these key terms.</p></div>",

He is the one whom I serve/worship</p></li><li><p>¶ I thank God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for you</span>. I worship him</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I serve:</strong> The word <em>serve</em> here refers to serving or working for God in a religious way. It might be better to use a word that means “worship.” For example, the REB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I <u>worship</u> with a clear conscience.</p></blockquote><h4>1:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>with a clear conscience as did my forefathers,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>even as my ancestors <span data-bnType=\"implied\">served/worshiped him</span>. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I serve/worship him</span> with a clear conscience.</p></li><li><p>and I know that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God knows/sees that</span> I have not done anything wrong. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">He is the God</span> whom my ancestors served/worshiped also.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with a clear conscience:</strong> The phrase <em>with a clear conscience</em> can be understood as referring:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>only to Paul. “I serve God as my ancestors did. I serve him with a clear conscience.”</p></li><li><p>to both Paul and his forefathers. “I serve God with a clear conscience. My ancestors also served God with a clear conscience.”</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">In most English translations, it is unclear whether the phrase <em>with a clear conscience</em> refers only to Paul or to both Paul and his forefathers. However, if possible in your language, translate in a way that people will understand the first interpretation. One reason for choosing interpretation (1) is that in this verse Paul was writing about his personal claim that he was an apostle. He was not necessarily claiming that his ancestors also had clear consciences.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a clear conscience:</strong> A person’s <em>conscience</em> is the part of a person that helps him know what is right and what is wrong to think or do. A conscience causes a person to feel ashamed or guilty if he does wrong, and makes him feel good when he does what is right.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul was implying that, although he was in prison, he was not there because he had committed a crime. On the contrary, he had been put in prison because he was trying to do what would please God. Paul was convinced that he had not done anything wrong. He did not feel guilty, so his conscience was <em>clear</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>forefathers:</strong> Another word for <em>forefathers</em> is “ancestors.” The word <em>forefathers</em> refers to a person’s relatives who were born before his parents and probably even before his grandparents.</p><h4>1:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>as I constantly remember you night and day in my prayers.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I thank God</span> while I constantly pray for you day and night.</p></li><li><p>Whether it is at night or during the day, I always remember to pray for you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as I constantly remember you night and day in my prayers:</strong> This is a way of saying that Paul prayed very frequently and when he prayed, he always prayed for Timothy.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>constantly:</strong> The Greek word that most English versions translate as <em>constantly</em> is emphasized in the Greek text. In the Display, this emphasis is shown by putting the word <em>constantly</em> before the verb “pray.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>night and day:</strong> Scholars differ as to whether the phrase <em>night and day</em> is connected to 1:3 or 1:4.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Most English versions understand this phrase to belong to <em>I constantly remember you… in my prayers</em> in 1:3. For example, the NLT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers. <em>See also BSB, NIV, GNT, NRSV, NET, NASB, REB, NJB, KJV, GW, CEV.</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>A few translations have punctuated the sentence in such a way that this phrase belongs with “I long to see you” at the beginning of 1:4. For example, the RSV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>4</sup>As I remember your tears, I long night and day to see you, <em>See also JBP.</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) as do the majority of translations.</p>",

The verb here can be translated as “I remember” (see GNT, NJB, CEV, NCV), or “I recall” (see NET).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>sincere faith:</strong> In your language it may be clearer to say, “you truly believed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ Jesus</span>.” This same phrase <em>sincere faith</em> is found in 1 Timothy 1:5.

When Paul used the phrase <em>first dwelt</em>, he meant that Timothy’s grandmother and mother “had faith” in Jesus Christ before Timothy did.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is natural to say that Timothy’s mother and grandmother “had faith” in Jesus Christ. (GNT is an example of this.) But if this is not natural in your language, then you may need to replace the noun “faith” with the verb “believe.” Then you would state who believed (that is, “your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice believed”). You may also need to add the implied information that they believed “in Jesus Christ.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>grandmother:</strong> Here the term <em>grandmother</em> refers to “the mother of Timothy’s mother.”</p><h4>1:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and I am convinced is in you as well.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and I am convinced/sure that you now believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in him</span> also.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I am convinced:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>convinced</em> also means “persuaded.” Paul saw evidence that Timothy truly believed in Jesus because of what Timothy had learned from his mother and his grandmother, and also because Paul had seen that Timothy behaved as a true follower of Christ. These things made Paul sure/certain that Timothy truly believed in Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>is in you as well:</strong> Here, the clause <em>in you as well</em> is similar to what Paul said concerning Timothy’s mother and grandmother in 1:5b.

One way to translate <em>For this reason</em> is to make the reason explicit by saying:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Since you genuinely believe</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to fan into flame:</strong> Here Paul compared Timothy’s gift to a fire. The clause <em>fan into flame</em> is the translation of one Greek word. There are two ways to interpret this word:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Paul was concerned that Timothy had not been using his gift to his fullest capacity. Therefore he challenged Timothy to “fan into flame” or “rekindle” his use of the gift. For example, the NLT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This is why I remind you to fan into flames the spiritual gift God gave you <em>See also BSB, NIV, RSV, NASB, NET, REB, NJB, GW, JBP.</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Paul was simply encouraging Timothy to continue to use his gift. He was not implying that Timothy had not been using his gift. For example, the NCV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This is why I remind you to keep using the gift God gave you <em>See also GNT and CEV.</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This interpretation uses this Greek word in its literal sense, that is, “rekindle” or “light again.” This implies that Timothy’s gift was like a fire that had almost gone out or died and needed to be revived to a useful state. One can rekindle a fire by fanning it or by stirring up the coals.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the gift of God:</strong> This spiritual <em>gift</em> was a special ability that God gave Timothy. It enabled him to serve God and minister to other believers in Ephesus. Several verses in 2 Timothy imply that the gift that God had given to Timothy was the ability to serve as a leader (see 4:2 and 4:5).</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:6a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">When the word <em>gift</em> is used with the word “rekindle,” the two become a vivid figure of speech. By using this figure of speech, Paul meant that Timothy should reactivate his spiritual gift. This was the gift that the Holy Spirit had given him and that he was to use for God’s service.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">You have several options for translating the figure of speech <em>fan into flame the gift of God</em>.</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Maintain the figure of speech, if possible.</p></li><li><p>Use a figure of speech that occurs in your language and means something like “to start doing something energetically again.”</p></li><li><p>Replace the figure of speech with the direct meaning and translate it “restore/reactivate/revive the gift of God.”</p></li></ul></div><h4>1:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>which is in you through the laying on of my hands.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>when I laid/put my hands on your <span data-bnType=\"implied\">head</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Remember that you received that gift</span> when I laid my hands on you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>which is in you through the laying on of my hands:</strong> Some time previously, Paul had put his hands on Timothy (probably on his head). Then he prayed that God would give him a special ability to minister to the believers in the Ephesian church. Paul implied that Timothy received that gift/ability at that time. (Perhaps Paul refers here to the time he mentioned in 1 Timothy 4:14 when the elders prayed for Timothy, but in this verse he mentions only that he laid his hands on Timothy.)</p>",

In this declaration, Paul was speaking of at least Timothy and himself.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God did not give us a spirit that makes us afraid…. (NCV) <em>(BSB, NIV, RSV, NASB, REB, NJB, KJV, NCV, GW, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means the <u>Holy Spirit</u>.

(CEV) <em>(GNT, NET, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) and the majority of Bible scholars.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>fear:</strong> In this context <em>fear</em> means “timidity.” It describes a person who fears doing something that is his duty to do, and so he refuses to do it or avoids doing it. In this context, it probably means that Timothy had been afraid to do some of the tasks that God had told him to do and had given him a special ability to do.</p><h4>1:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but of power,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>On the contrary, God gives us <span data-bnType=\"implied\">spiritual</span> power,</p></li><li><p>Instead, God enables us <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to serve him</span> with strength,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but:</strong> The Greek conjunction <em>alla</em>, which means <em>but</em>, indicates a strong contrast between 1:7a and 1:7b. Some other ways to indicate this strong contrast are “instead” or “on the contrary.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a spirit of power:</strong> As was explained in 1:7a, Paul was talking about the human spirit/nature.

Paul meant that the Roman authorities had put him in prison because he was serving Christ. Be careful that when you translate <em>His prisoner</em> that your translation does not imply that Christ was keeping Paul in prison. Here is one way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Do not be ashamed of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">being</span> my <span data-bnType=\"implied\">friend, although I am</span> a prisoner because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I serve</span> Christ.</p></blockquote><h4>1:8c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:8c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Instead, join me in suffering for the gospel by the power of God.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Rather, join me in suffering for <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the sake of</span> the gospel.

Some other ways to show this contrast are “Rather” or But.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>join me in suffering:</strong> This is the translation of one Greek verb. It means “to suffer like someone else has suffered” or “to share another person’s hardships.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul knew that he would continue to suffer because he preached to people about Jesus Christ. So he urged Timothy to follow his example, to be willing to suffer for Christ, and to endure the evil things that people would do to him because he was preaching this good news.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for the gospel:</strong> Some others ways to say this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for the sake of the gospel</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>on behalf of the gospel</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for telling people the gospel</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>gospel:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>gospel</em> literally means “good news.” However, in the New Testament the word <em>gospel</em> does not mean just any kind of good news. It specifically means “the good news that God has made a way to save sinful human beings through Jesus.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate <em>gospel</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>good news</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>good message</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s message</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s good news</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>message from God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>message of/about Jesus</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also the word gospel in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by the power of God:</strong> The phrase <em>by the power of God</em> indicates <u>how</u> Timothy could endure suffering for preaching the gospel.

For example, GW says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God saved us and called us to be holy…. <em>See also BSB, NIV, GNT, REB, NJB, NLT, JBP, NLT, CEV, JBP, NCV.</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>God called us “<u>with/by-means-of</u> a holy calling.” According to this interpretation, the term “holy calling” is a description of the <u>way</u> that God called us.

There are several translation possibilities for this interpretation. These are discussed below.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>called:</strong> The word <em>called</em> is used in a special sense here. It means “summoned” or “chosen” (NLT, CEV), or “invited.” Do not use a word that only refers to someone “calling loudly.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a holy calling:</strong> Following interpretation (1) above, you can translate <em>holy calling</em> as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God called us to live a <u>holy life</u>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God called us to be his <u>holy people</u>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God called us to be <u>holy</u>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also holy in the Glossary, Meaning 1.</p><h4>1:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>not because of our works,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He called/chose us</span> not because we have done <span data-bnType=\"implied\">good</span> deeds/works,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He did</span> not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">call us</span> because we had done anything <span data-bnType=\"implied\">good to deserve it</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He chose us</span>, even though we have not done anything <span data-bnType=\"implied\">righteous</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not because of our works:</strong> This clause refers back to the two verbs in 1:9a–b. That is, “He (God) saved us and called/chose us (incl).” He did all of this for us even though we had not done anything to deserve it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>our works:</strong> This refers to the acts or deeds that we have done, and the way we have behaved.</p><h4>1:9d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but by His own purpose and by the grace</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but because of his own plan <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to choose us</span> and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">show his</span> kindness <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to us</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Instead, he called us</span> because he himself had planned to do it and because he wanted to be kind to us in this manner.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but by His own purpose and by the grace:</strong> This phrase explains the reason for which God saved us and chose us to be his holy people.

Therefore, in 1:9a–d Paul was saying that God saved us and called us because he planned to do these things.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>purpose and by the grace:</strong> The words <em>purpose</em> and <em>grace</em> are abstract nouns. It may be necessary in your language to use verbs rather than nouns to express these concepts.

The Greek is ambiguous. There are two points of view about how these two periods of time relate to each other.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some scholars say that the two clauses should be connected with an <u>and</u>. They believe that 1:10a expresses the next step in God’s plan of grace. For example, the NLT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And now he has made all of this plain to us…. <em>See also BSB, RSV, REB, LSA.</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Other scholars say that the two clauses should be connected with a <u>but</u>. They believe that 1:10a expresses a contrast in time with 1:9e. For example, the NCV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but it is now shown to us… <em>See also NIV, GNT, NET, NASB, KJV, NJB.</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). However, interpretation (2) also has much support. If the major language version in your area follows interpretation (2), you may want to follow interpretation (2) instead.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>this grace:</strong> Grace continues to be the subject in 1:10a. God has revealed/shown to us his grace through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p><h4>1:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It is</span> through/by Christ Jesus, our<sup>(incl)</sup> Savior, who appeared <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to us</span>.</p></li><li><p>because Christ Jesus, who saved us,<sup>(incl)</sup> came <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to earth</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus:</strong> The phrase <em>the appearing of our Savior</em> refers to all that Jesus did while he lived on the earth. It includes Jesus’ death and rising again.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>our Savior, Christ Jesus:</strong> This is the only time in the New Testament Greek text that these three names occur in this order. In other places in the New Testament text, the order of this phrase is always “(our) Savior Jesus Christ.” It is recommended that you retain the same order for <em>Christ Jesus</em> here as you used in 1:1a.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Savior:</strong> <em>Savior</em> here means “one who saves/rescues someone from spiritual and eternal danger.” See Savior in the Glossary, Meaning 3.</p><h4>1:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who has abolished death</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He destroyed/ended/defeated <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the power of</span> death,</p></li><li><p>Jesus destroyed/ended <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the power of all things that would harm a person</span> after he dies,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who has abolished death:</strong> Paul spoke of <em>death</em> as something that Christ abolished/destroyed/defeated. Not all languages speak about death this way. You need to translate this to show that the effects of death are ended. Physically, the bodies of Christians will be raised to life when Christ returns. Spiritually, Christians do not die. They go to be with Christ (Philippians 1:23).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to say this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He has ended the power of death (GNT).</p></blockquote><h4>1:10d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:10d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and illuminated the way to life and immortality through the gospel,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and he showed us<sup>(incl)</sup> through the good news that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">there is a way for us<sup>(incl)</sup></span> to live forever.</p></li><li><p>and he used the good news to show/reveal everlasting life to us.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and illuminated the way to life and immortality through the gospel:</strong> “Our Savior, Christ Jesus” (1:10b) continues to be the subject here.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Because of the presence of the Greek word <em>men</em> in v.10c, consultants should check that v.10d has received at least as much prominence as 10c, preferably more.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>illuminated the way:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>illuminated the way</em> is a metaphor that means “to show” or “to reveal.” Christ has allowed us to “see/know/experience” life and immortality.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>life and immortality:</strong> In this phrase the word <em>immortality</em> describes <em>life</em>. Together these two terms mean “a (spiritual) life that lasts forever.” Two possible ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>immortal life (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>everlasting life (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>through the gospel:</strong> The <em>gospel</em> message (or good news) was the means that Christ (and his followers) used to tell human beings that he had given them everlasting life.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>gospel:</strong> See gospel in the Glossary and in the notes at 1:8c.</p>",

You may need to make this explicit and say, “Yet I am not ashamed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of being in prison for Christ’s sake</span>.” The word that Paul used here for <em>I am not ashamed</em> is the same Greek word that he used in Romans 1:16.</p><h4>1:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for I know whom I have believed,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because I know <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the one</span> whom I have trusted,</p></li><li><p>because I know <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ,</span> and I <span data-bnType=\"implied\">continue to</span> trust him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for I know whom I have believed:</strong> Verse parts 1:12c and 1:12d contain two reasons why Paul was not ashamed of being in prison. The first reason (1:12c) that he was not ashamed was because he believed/trusted in Jesus Christ and he knew that Jesus was God.</p><h4>1:12d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and I am convinced that He is able to guard what I have entrusted to Him for that day.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because</span> I am convinced/certain that Christ is able to keep safe what he has entrusted to me until the day <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he returns</span>.</p></li><li><p>Christ entrusted/gave to me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the good news</span>.

Paul was not free to travel about and preach. But he was convinced that Christ would ensure that the good news would continue to be proclaimed until the day Christ returns.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for that day:</strong> This refers to the day when Christ will return and judge all people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this phrase are “until the judgment day” or “until Christ returns.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>what I have entrusted to Him:</strong> There are two translation issues you must address before you can translate this verse.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Issue 1:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>what I have entrusted to Him</em> is literally “my deposit.” In Greek, it is not clear in what sense the deposit was Paul’s. There are two possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It was Paul’s deposit because <u>Christ</u> entrusted the deposit to <u>Paul</u>. For example, GNT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>what he has entrusted to me. <em>See also RSV, NET, REB, GW, CEV, JBP, NCV.</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It was Paul’s deposit because <u>Paul</u> entrusted the deposit to <u>Christ</u>. For example, the NLT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>what I have entrusted to him. <em>See also BSB, NIV, NRSV, NASB, KJV, NJB.</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) for the following reason. The same word for “deposit” that appears here also appears in 1:14 and in 1 Timothy 6:20. In these other two contexts, the word clearly means something that God had entrusted to Timothy. For this reason, the versions listed under interpretation (1) above interpret “my deposit” here as something that the Lord had entrusted to Paul.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, interpretation (2) also has strong support among the major English translations. If the major language version in your area follows interpretation (2), then you may prefer to choose it. If so, you could say,</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I am convinced that Christ is able to keep safe what I have entrusted to him until the day he returns.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Whichever interpretation you choose to follow, it is recommended that you write a footnote to explain the alternative interpretation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Issue 2:</strong> The second issue is what the deposit refers to. If you do not need to make this explicit, you can follow the GNT and say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I am sure that he is able to keep safe until that Day what he has entrusted to me.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you need to make explicit what the deposit is, read below.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>If you follow interpretation (1) above, then the deposit was probably the gospel itself, which was what Paul preached and taught.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Perhaps the deposit also included the people who had believed as a result of Paul’s preaching the gospel. Paul believed that God had told him to care for these people. He was sure that even after he died, true believers would continue to preach the gospel message to others and God would protect the people who had believed.</span></span> If you follow this interpretation, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am convinced that Christ is able to keep safe the gospel message until the day he returns.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>If you follow interpretation (2), then the deposit was probably Paul’s life or his service to Christ. If you follow this interpretation you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am convinced that Christ is able to protect my <span data-bnType=\"implied\">service/life</span> that I have given to him until the day he returns.</p></blockquote></li></ol>",

Here, he was telling Timothy to remember what he had taught him and to preserve it as the model of true doctrine.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Hold on to:</strong> Here, the phrase <em>Hold on to</em> means to “keep” or “preserve.” It is parallel to the word “guard” in 1:14. <em>Hold on to </em>implies holding on to something so that it will not be changed or lost.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>pattern:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>pattern</em> only occurs in the New Testament here and in 1 Timothy 1:16. Other meanings for <em>pattern</em> are “model” or “example.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the Greek sentence, <em>pattern</em> occurs before the verb <em>keep</em>. This emphasizes this noun.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In this context, the word <em>pattern</em> refers to an abstract idea. It may be necessary for you to use a phrase or a clause to express this idea. Here is one way you might translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The things that you have heard from me are worthy to be followed / imitated. Keep/Preserve/Hold on to this sound teaching.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sound teaching:</strong> This phrase in Greek is literally “healthy words.” Paul was talking about true and correct doctrine, or a true and correct set of beliefs. This true and correct doctrine is the message that Paul preached to tell people that God saves them by means of Jesus Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you have heard from me:</strong> The phrase <em>you have heard from me</em> is the direct object of the verb <em>hold</em>. GNT expresses this clearly: “Hold firmly to the true words that I taught you.”</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:13a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Some English translations imply that Paul was instructing Timothy to follow his example by teaching the same things that he taught. While this may be implied, you should not make this explicit in your translation. The emphasis here is on preserving correct doctrine, not on teaching it.</p></div><h4>1:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Do this</span> with faith and love because you are united with Christ Jesus.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">As you do this, continue to</span> believe in Jesus and to love <span data-bnType=\"implied\">others</span> because you are united with Christ Jesus.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus:</strong> Scholars do not agree about whether this phrase modifies the previous clause or whether it is a separate instruction. So this phrase can be understood in the following two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It <u>tells how</u> Timothy was to “hold on to [what he heard from Paul] as the pattern of sound teaching.” For example, GW says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>With faith and love for Christ Jesus, consider what you heard me say to be the pattern of accurate teachings. <em>See also BSB, NIV, RSV, NET, REB.</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is a <u>separate instruction</u>. For example, GNT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and remain in the faith and love that are ours in union with Christ Jesus. <em>See also NLT, CEV.</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) as the majority of English versions do.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the faith and love:</strong> If you want to translate these two nouns as verbs, you can say, “to believe in Jesus and to love others.” See faith in the Glossary, Meaning 1.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in Christ Jesus:</strong> The phrase <em>in Christ Jesus</em> means “to be united with Christ Jesus.” Paul told Timothy to continue to believe in Jesus and to love others because Timothy was united with Jesus.</p>",

Paul combined these two ideas to tell Timothy to “defend the gospel against attack from enemies.”</p><h4>1:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>with the help of the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Protect it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.<sup>(incl)</sup></p></li><li><p>The Holy Spirit who is in us<sup>(incl)</sup> will help you to protect the message <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so that it will not be changed</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with the help of the Holy Spirit who dwells in us:</strong> Paul told Timothy <u>how</u> he was to protect the true message.

See holy in the Glossary, Meaning 2.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>with the help of the Holy Spirit:</strong> This phrase explains how Paul wanted Timothy to guard the treasure that was entrusted to him. It means, “guard with the help of the Holy Spirit.” This is why the NIV adds the word “guard” in 1:14b. You should do what is more natural in your language—one longer sentence (see BSB, RSV, GNT), or two shorter clauses or sentences with the verb repeated.</p>",

It is probable that these people lived in the province of Asia and that Timothy knew them. Paul contrasted a faithful friend named Onesiphorus with the people who had abandoned him.</p></div><h4>1:15a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:15a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>You know that everyone in the Province of Asia</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ You are aware that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">many of the Christians/believers that live</span> in the province of Asia</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You know:</strong> Paul changed his theme here. He used the clause that the BSB translates as <em>You know</em> instead of a conjunction to indicate this change of theme. In some languages there is a word or part of a word that indicates a change in theme. In other languages this may be a phrase, or a clause or even a whole sentence. Make sure your translation indicates Paul’s change in theme here in the way that your language signals a change in the theme.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that:</strong> In the Greek text, a word that means “this” immediately follows the verb <em>You know</em>. It emphasizes what Paul was sure that Timothy already knew.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>everyone:</strong> In this context, the word <em>everyone</em> is an exaggeration. It does not literally mean that all the people who lived in the province of Asia abandoned Paul. It refers here to a number of Christians whom Paul had considered to be his friends, or possibly to be followers of what he taught. He had depended on these people to help him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This type of exaggeration is common in many languages. However, if people understand this word literally, then you may have to say something like “many believers.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Province of Asia:</strong> Asia was the name of a province of the Roman Empire. It was not the present day continent of Asia. The <em>Province of Asia</em> was a part of the country that people now call Turkey. Ephesus was the capital city of the <em>Province of Asia</em>, and it was the city where Timothy lived and served as a church leader.</p><h4>1:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>has deserted me,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>have abandoned/rejected me,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>has deserted me:</strong> Commentators believe that the Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>has deserted</em> refers to one of two things:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><u>A general situation</u>. Paul may have been thinking that people had left or abandoned him in the sense that they no longer accepted him as their leader. Or perhaps Paul was referring to those who had accepted his message at first but later turned away.</p></li><li><p><u>A specific occasion</u>. Paul may have been thinking of a specific time when the people of the province of Asia deserted him. Perhaps they did not visit him when he was in prison or support him when he was on trial. (See 4:16.)</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">We cannot be sure which of these Paul was referring to, so you should not try to make either one explicit in your translation. Use a general verb such as “abandon” or one whose meaning could include or refer to as many of these situations as possible.</p><h4>1:15c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:15c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>including Phygelus and Hermogenes.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>even Phygelus and Hermogenes.</p></li><li><p>Even <span data-bnType=\"implied\">my friends</span> Phygelus and Hermogenes <span data-bnType=\"implied\">have abandoned/rejected me</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>including Phygelus and Hermogenes:</strong> <em>Phygelus</em> and <em>Hermogenes</em> were the names of two men.

He was a faithful friend to Paul. Paul was contrasting his conduct with the conduct of the people whom he had mentioned in 1:15. The second Meaning Line of the Display for 1:16a includes a sentence that explicitly shows this contrast.</p><h4>1:16b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:16b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because he has often refreshed me</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because he <span data-bnType=\"implied\">visited me and</span> helped/encouraged me many times,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because he has often refreshed me:</strong> The word <em>refreshed</em> probably refers to ways Onesiphorus encouraged Paul while Paul was in prison. It may have included visiting him, bringing him food and being kind to him in other ways. You may have a figure of speech in your language for the word “refresh” that will convey what Paul meant here.</p><h4>1:16c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:16c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and was unashamed of my chains.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and was not ashamed of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">visiting</span> me here in prison.</p></li><li><p>He was not ashamed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to visit</span> me, even though I am in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">prison and tied with</span> chains.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and was unashamed of my chains:</strong> The BSB literally translates the Greek word for <em>chains</em>. In those days people punished criminals by putting them in prison and fastening metal chains to or between their hands and feet. They did this to prevent the criminals from moving around and finding a way to escape. So <em>chains</em> is a figure of speech meaning that Paul was in prison.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In many languages, it will be necessary not to use this figure of speech but rather follow the GNT, which says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He was not ashamed that I am in prison</p></blockquote>",

The Greek says <em>the Lord</em> twice in this sentence. Most commentators believe that <em>the Lord</em> refers to Christ both times. You may want to consider following the model of the BSB here and use <em>the Lord</em> only once and use a pronoun the second time. If you do this you may want to use the name Onesiphorus instead of the pronoun “him” as the BSB does.

In 1:15–18, Paul wrote about what had happened to some of his relationships with people since the Roman authorities had put him in prison. At the beginning of chapter 2, Paul again gave Timothy some instructions. He told Timothy to:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>be strong by means of the special ability Jesus gave him (2:1).</p></li><li><p>teach qualified people the message Paul had taught him (2:2).</p></li></ol></div><h4>2:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>You therefore, my child, be strong</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ You then, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Timothy,</span> my son, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">continue to</span> be strong/strengthened</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">As for</span> you, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Timothy,</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who are like</span> my son, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">continue to</span> be strong/strengthened <span data-bnType=\"implied\">spiritually</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You therefore:</strong> The words <em>You therefore</em> signal two things. One is that Paul was returning to talking to Timothy after talking about other people in 1:15–18. The other is that he was returning to his main theme of instructing Timothy.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>my child:</strong> When Paul addressed Timothy as <em>my child</em>, Paul was expressing his affection for Timothy. If speakers of your language would think that the phrase <em>my child</em> means that Timothy was really Paul’s son in a physical sense, you could say “you are like my child,” or even “dear Timothy,” or a similar phrase that people use to express affection. See the note on 1:2b.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>be strong:</strong> Paul encouraged Timothy to be strong in serving Jesus Christ. When Paul said <em>be strong</em> he was not talking about physical strength. He was talking about inner strength or courage. He urged Timothy to be disciplined and to be willing to endure suffering as he served the Lord.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>be strong</em> is a passive verb. Some languages may need to make this verb active by saying:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Let God make you strong.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Let God strengthen you.</p></blockquote><h4>2:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>by means of the grace that Christ Jesus <span data-bnType=\"implied\">gives you</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It is</span> Christ Jesus <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who</span> gives you the ability <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be strong</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the grace:</strong> In this verse, Paul used the word <em>grace</em> in a different sense than he used it in 1:9d. Here, Paul was referring to <u>an ability</u> that God gives to all people who trust in Christ. Paul was talking about the ability to endure suffering, to obey God, and in general to live in a way that pleases God. See grace in the Glossary, Meaning 3.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">When Paul commanded Timothy to be strong <em>in the grace</em>, he means that Timothy should be strong “by means of the grace,” “through/with the grace,” or “using the grace” that Christ gives him.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that is in Christ Jesus:</strong> The phrase <em>in Christ Jesus</em> is ambiguous. It can mean:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Christ is the source of grace. Grace is provided in/by Christ Jesus. He gives us grace. For example, JBP says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Be strong in the grace that Christ Jesus gives.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>God gives grace to those who believe in (or are united with) Christ Jesus, that is, grace that is given (by God) to those who believe in Christ Jesus. For example, the NLT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Be strong with the special favor God gives you in Christ Jesus.</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions translate literally the phrases <em>in the grace that is in Christ Jesus</em>. As a result, either of the above interpretations is possible. If possible, you should also translate so that either interpretation is possible. If you must choose one, choose interpretation (1).</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:1</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be helpful to reverse the order of 2:1a and 2:1b and translate it as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ Jesus gives us the ability/grace <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be strong</span>. So then, my son, be strong.</p></blockquote></div>",

In 1:15–18, Paul wrote about what had happened to some of his relationships with people since the Roman authorities had put him in prison. At the beginning of chapter 2, Paul again gave Timothy some instructions. He told Timothy to:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>be strong by means of the special ability Jesus gave him (2:1).</p></li><li><p>teach qualified people the message Paul had taught him (2:2).</p></li></ol></div><h4>2:2</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:2, Paul gave Timothy the second command. This second command was that Timothy should pass this teaching on to others.</p><h4>2:2a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And the things that you have heard me say</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>As for the things/message <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about Christ</span> that you have heard me teach</p></li><li><p>You have heard me teaching <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the message about Christ</span> to you</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And the things that you have heard me say:</strong> The wording here is similar, but not identical, to 1:13a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>And:</strong> In Greek, 2:1 and 2:2 are one sentence. The word <em>And</em> indicates a simple coordination between the command in 2:1 and the command in this verse. Many English translations begin a new sentence here and do not include the word <em>And</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the things:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates here as <em>the things</em> refers to the phrase “sound teaching” in 1:13. Because <em>things</em> is emphasized in Greek, one way to show this is to say, “As for the things you have heard me say….”</p><h4>2:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>among many witnesses,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>before many witnesses,</p></li><li><p>and many other people.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>among many witnesses:</strong> The Greek word <em>dia</em>, which the BSB translates with the phrase <em>among</em>, usually means “through” or “by.” So Bible scholars have different opinions about what the Greek text means here.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means that Timothy had heard Paul preach and teach the gospel <u>in front of</u> or <u>in the presence of</u> many people. For example, GNT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Take the teachings that you heard me proclaim in the presence of many witnesses <em>See also BSB, NIV, RSV, KJV, JBP, NET, NASB, REB.</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means that Timothy had heard the gospel confirmed <u>through</u> or <u>by</u> many other people. Timothy had heard the gospel message from Paul. He had also heard it from others. For example, the NLT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You have heard me teach many things that have been confirmed by many reliable witnesses. <em>See also NJB, NRSV, GW, NCV.</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>witnesses:</strong> The <em>witnesses</em> are people who have seen or heard something. Here it refers to those who had heard Paul speak. They could confirm that Paul had preached the gospel and that what he said was true. This is the same word that is used in 1 Timothy 5:19 and 1 Timothy 6:12.</p><h4>2:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>entrust these to faithful men</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>teach/transmit that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">same message</span> to dependable/trustworthy people</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">So, I want you to</span> teach that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">same message</span> to other believers whom you trust</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>entrust these to faithful men:</strong> The verb <em>entrust</em> means to “leave something valuable with other people who will keep it safe.” Here, the thing that Timothy was to entrust was the message about Jesus Christ. Paul wanted Timothy to teach that message to people whom he was certain would not change the message. These were to be people whom Timothy could trust to teach the gospel accurately to other people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>faithful:</strong> Other words for <em>faithful</em> are “reliable,” “trustworthy,” or “dependable.”</p><h4>2:2d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who will be qualified to teach others as well.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>who will also be able to teach <span data-bnType=\"implied\">it to</span> others.</p></li><li><p>and who will know how to teach <span data-bnType=\"implied\">it to</span> other people.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who will be qualified to teach others as well:</strong> The men whom Timothy was to choose were to be those who were able to teach well.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>qualified:</strong> This word means “capable” or “competent.”</p>",

Because of this, English versions differ in how they translate this verb:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Many English versions also leave the object implicit and use a clause that does not require an object. For example, the CEV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Endure your share of suffering…. <em>See also RSV, GNT, JBP, NET, REB, NJB.</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Some versions supply the object “us.” That is, Paul was telling Timothy to share in the suffering he and other believers were enduring. So the NIV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Endure hardship with us <em>See also NCV.</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Other versions like the BSB supply the object “me.” That is, Paul was telling Timothy to share in the suffering that he himself was enduring. So NLT says,</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Endure suffering along with me…. <em>See also NASB, GW.</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">If possible, you should follow option (1) like the Greek text and the majority of versions and translate it with a verb or phrase that does not require an object.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If, however, you must make explicit the people with whom Timothy was to suffer, here are some suggestions:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Endure hardship with <span data-bnType=\"implied\">us</span> (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Suffer with <span data-bnType=\"implied\">us (excl)</span></p></blockquote><h4>2:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>as a good soldier of Christ Jesus <span data-bnType=\"implied\">suffers</span>.</p></li><li><p>as a good soldier of Christ Jesus <span data-bnType=\"implied\">accepts/endures suffering</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>like a good soldier of Christ Jesus:</strong> Paul compared Christians to soldiers, because both Christians and soldiers need to endure hardship.

That theme is that a Christian who wants to serve the Lord must be like a loyal soldier. He must be willing to endure suffering.</p></div><h4>2:4–6</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:4–6, Paul compared the Christian to three types of people. Then in 2:7 he advised Timothy to think deeply about the meaning of these three comparisons. This shows that the point of comparison in Paul’s illustrations would not be immediately clear even to Timothy. He needed to think about what Paul wrote to him. Because of this, you should avoid making the points of comparison explicit in your translation.</p><h4>2:4a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:4a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>A soldier refrains from entangling himself in civilian affairs,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>A soldier who is serving <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the army</span> does not do another kind of work <span data-bnType=\"implied\">at the same time</span>.</p></li><li><p>No one who is a soldier becomes involved in civilian matters,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>A soldier:</strong> This refers to a soldier on active duty.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>entangling himself:</strong> This phrase is the translation of one Greek verb. It occurs only here and in 2 Peter 2:20. It means “to get entangled in” or “to get mixed up with.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in civilian affairs:</strong> This phrase is literally “matters/affairs of life.” It can refer to any matter in general, or more specifically, to a business or job that is not a military job. A soldier may have brief times when he is not actually working as a soldier, but even during those times he is not free to start working at some other kind of job.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>everyday matters (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>non-military activities (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>2:4b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:4b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in order to please the one who enlisted him.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that he may please his commanding officer.</p></li><li><p>because he wants to please his commanding officer.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">If he does,</span> he will not please his commander/leader.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in order to:</strong> In the Greek text, the conjunction <em>hina</em> (<em>in order to</em>) connects 2:4a and 2:4b. There are several ways to show this connection.</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Make the conjunction implicit. The NIV uses a dash to indicate the connection between these two verse parts.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>4a</sup>No one serving as a soldier gets involved in civilian affairs—<sup>4b</sup>he wants to please his commanding officer. <em>Other translations (GW, CEV) begin a new sentence at 2:4b.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>4a</sup>Soldiers on duty don’t work at outside jobs. <sup>4b</sup>They try only to please their commanding officer. (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Make the conjunction explicit like the BSB and and NASB do. For example, the NASB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life, <u>so that</u> he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>State 2:4b negatively like the NET does.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No one in military service gets entangled in matters of everyday life; otherwise he will not please the one who recruited him. <em>See also NLT, and JBP.</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Reorder 2:4a and 2:4b.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>4b</sup>A soldier wants to please his commanding officer, <sup>4a</sup>so he does not get involved in civilian affairs.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">You should use the option that is most natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the one who enlisted him:</strong> In Greek, this is literally “the one having enlisted (him).” The BSB, RSV, NASB, and NET translate this literally. However, a literal translation like “the enlistment officer” may give the wrong impression. In Paul’s time, each officer gathered together (or enlisted) the men he later commanded. This was different than many of today’s armies where the enlistment officer is a completely different person than the commanding officer. Therefore, a term like “commanding officer” or “commander” may be more appropriate.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:4</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The Christian’s commanding officer is Christ. The point of the comparison between a soldier and a person who serves Christ is that the soldier and the Christian must each completely commit himself to his commander, doing whatever the commander tells him to do.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">However, the point of comparison should not be made explicit in the translation because in 2:7, Paul asked Timothy to think about what he was saying and said that the Lord would help Timothy to understand it. Therefore, Paul was not trying to be completely explicit.</p></div>",

Just as an athletic competitor has to follow rules when he plays a game, so Christ has given believers rules regarding their behavior. Paul made this comparison to remind Timothy that he should follow all these rules.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Likewise:</strong> The common combination of Greek conjunctions <em>de</em> <em>kai</em> (“and also”) connects 2:4 and 2:5. The BSB translates this phrase with the word <em>Likewise</em> to show that Paul was using another example to illustrate his point. Another way to show this connection is with the word “also,” as the NET, NASB, and NCV have done.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a competitor:</strong> This phrase is the translation of the Greek verb <em>athleō</em>. The English word “athlete” comes from this verb. It means “to compete in a contest.” This verb implies that the athlete is not merely playing a game for fun. He wants to win. Also, the verb implies that the contest was for young people or adults—Paul was not talking about a child’s game. Other ways to express this idea are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if someone plays in a sport/game</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if a runner runs a race</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if anyone competes as an athlete (NIV)</p></blockquote><h4>2:5b–c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:5b–c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>does not receive the crown unless he competes according to the rules.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>he does not win the prize unless he competes/runs according to the rules.</p></li><li><p>if he does not obey the rules <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the race/sport</span>, no one will give him a prize/ reward <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when he finishes/wins the game/contest</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>does not receive the crown:</strong> In the sports that Paul was thinking of, the person in charge of the contest, or some other important person, placed a <em>crown</em> made out of leaves on the head of the winner as a symbol of victory.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you do not have a word for “crown,” you can use a more general term, such as “prize” or “reward.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>unless he competes according to the rules:</strong> The point of the comparison in 2:5a is that there are specific rules for each sport that people who compete in that sport must obey. The person who does not obey the rules cannot win.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to state this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if he does not follow/obey the rules</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if he does not compete/play according to the rules</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:5</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to reverse the order of 2:5b and 2:5c as follows:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If he does not compete according to the rules, he does not win the victor’s crown.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It is also possible to combine 2:5a–c as follows:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Also, an athlete cannot win a prize if he does not play by the rules.</p></blockquote></div>",

So, in this context, it means, “to continue to think about.” GW expresses this clearly:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Always think about Jesus Christ.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul was not implying that Timothy might forget Jesus or facts about him. He wanted to remind Timothy to think about Jesus Christ continually.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Jesus Christ:</strong> This is one of the few places in Paul’s letters to Timothy that the order of the names is Jesus Christ instead of Christ Jesus. It is recommended that you keep the same order as in the Greek and the BSB.

In the congregation in Ephesus, some who said they were believers were trying to teach a different message. (See 2:14–18.)</p></div>",

GNT uses one of the most common ways by repeating some form of 2:8d “the gospel that I preach” at the beginning of 2:9a. This way is followed in the Display. (See also GW, NLT, CEV, JBP.)</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>which I suffer:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>suffer</em> is related to the word translated “endure hardship” in 2:3a. It is a general word that can include all of the things Paul had endured because people tried to stop him from preaching the good news about Jesus Christ. In particular, at this time, Paul was suffering because he was in prison.</p><h4>2:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to the extent of being chained like a criminal.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I am even bound with chains <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in prison</span> as if I were a criminal.</p></li><li><p>I am even treated like a law-breaker and chained <span data-bnType=\"implied\">here in prison</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to the extent of being chained like a criminal:</strong> In those days people punished criminals by fastening metal chains to or between their hands and feet. They did this to prevent the criminals from moving around and finding a way to escape from the prison. Paul mentioned the chains earlier in 1:16c.</p><h4>2:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But the word of God cannot be chained!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But God’s word, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in contrast,</span> is not bound/tied with chains.</p></li><li><p>But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">no one</span> can bind/chain the word of God.</p></li><li><p>But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other people</span> will preach God’s word.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But:</strong> The Greek conjunction <em>alla</em>, which the BSB translates here as <em>But</em>, signals a strong contrast between Paul’s situation and God’s word. If your language uses a word in addition to “but” to mark such a contrast, you may want to use it here. Some ways of showing this contrast in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But God’s word, <u>in contrast</u>…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But <u>as for</u> God’s word….</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the word of God cannot be chained!:</strong> This clause is a figure of speech. Paul meant that God’s word would continue to be preached. Even though Paul himself could not travel around to preach God’s word because chains held him, other Christians who were not in prison would continue to tell people the good news and teach the word of God. Neither chains nor any other thing could stop God’s word from being preached.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:9b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Some ways to translate 2:9b and 2:9c are:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use the word “chain” in both. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They chained me like a criminal, but they cannot chain God’s word.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the word “prison” in both. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am in prison like a criminal, but God’s word is not in prison.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Replace the figure of speech with the direct meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am chained like a criminal <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and cannot preach God’s word</span>, but others will preach God’s word</p></blockquote></li></ul></div>",

Because God’s word was not chained, Paul was willing to endure suffering so that other people could hear the good news about Jesus Christ and believe in him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>all things:</strong> The words <em>all things</em> refers to what Paul suffered. He was saying that he would endure whatever suffering he might have to. He would do this so that the people God had chosen could know Jesus.</p><h4>2:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for the sake of the elect,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>for the benefit of the people whom God has chosen,</p></li><li><p>so that the people whom God has chosen <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to belong to him</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the elect:</strong> The <em>elect</em> refers to the people that God has chosen to believe in him and be his special people. It is a key term and a phrase that Paul often used. In translating it, use the same expression as in Matthew 24:24; Luke 18:7; Ephesians 1:4 and Titus 1:1. Some translation possibilities are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s chosen people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the people God has chosen <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be his own/special people</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the people whom God has chosen <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to follow him</span></p></blockquote><h4>2:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that they also may <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believe</span> in Christ Jesus and be saved,</p></li><li><p>also may <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believe</span> in Christ Jesus and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he</span> may save them</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus:</strong> God has elected/chosen many people to belong to him. However, in order for them to belong to him (in other words, to become Christians), they must still hear the gospel and believe in Christ. Paul may have been tempted to stop preaching the gospel because of his suffering. But in this clause he told Timothy the reason he would not stop: he was committed to help people to believe in Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>they too:</strong> The word <em>too</em> refers back to the fact that Paul was saved. Paul said that he endured suffering so that the elect may “also” be saved, just as he was saved.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>obtain the salvation:</strong> The clause <em>obtain the salvation</em> is another way of saying “be saved.” For example, the CEV says, “Then God’s special people will be saved.” The Greek text does not indicate whether it is God or Christ Jesus who saves. If you must make this explicit, use Christ Jesus, as in the Display. See salvation in the Glossary, Word 2.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in Christ Jesus:</strong> In this verse, the phrase <em>in Christ Jesus</em> goes with the word <em>salvation</em>. Some ways of translating the entire phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>salvation that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they will receive by believing</span> in Christ Jesus.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>salvation that Christ Jesus <span data-bnType=\"implied\">gives to all people who believe.</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Christ Jesus may save them.</p></blockquote><h4>2:10d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:10d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>with eternal glory.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and have glory/honor that never ends.</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">provide them</span> with splendor that lasts forever.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with eternal glory:</strong> The phrase <em>with eternal glory</em> refers to the honor and splendor of eternal life when we will be in the presence of God forever.

He reminded Timothy that Jesus suffered and that Paul himself was suffering.</p></div><h4>2:11–13</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Many scholars consider 2:11–13 to be a poem or a hymn that Christians at that time knew well. It is recommended that you translate these verses as poetry and use the appropriate indentations for poetry in the printed edition. You should also use short sentences or clauses, as you might in a poem. While the meaning should be clear, you should avoid an overly free translation here that distracts from the poetry.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This poem or hymn consists of four lines: 2:11b, 2:12a, 2:12b, 2:13. The first two lines are promises, the second two lines are warnings.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Each line consists of a pair of clauses. (The one exception is the fourth line, which has three clauses.) The first clause in each pair begins with the word “if.” The second clause is the conclusion.</p><h4>2:11a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:11a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>This is a trustworthy saying:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The following saying is true:</p></li><li><p>These statements are true and you can trust them:</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>This is a trustworthy saying:</strong> A <em>trustworthy saying</em> means “well-known words that are true and can be trusted.” Paul used this same phrase in 1 Timothy 1:15, 3:1, 4:9. Because there are four lines in this <em>saying</em>, it may be necessary to use the plural “sayings” or another word like “statements.”</p><h4>2:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>If we died with Him,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>If we<sup>(incl)</sup> have died with Christ,</p></li><li><p>Since <span data-bnType=\"implied\">it is as though</span> we<sup>(incl)</sup> have died <span data-bnType=\"implied\">together</span> with him,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>If we died with Him:</strong></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we:</strong> The pronoun <em>we</em> refers to all Christians.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>died with Him:</strong> Most scholars agree that this clause is meant figuratively. In other words, <em>we died with Him</em> <u>spiritually</u>, not literally. It means that we “died” to sin and our old habits and behavior. However, all of the major English versions translate this clause literally.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is important to keep the figure of speech here for two reasons: (a) It is poetic, and (b) the figure of “dying with Christ” is also used elsewhere in the New Testament, particularly in Romans 6.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Him:</strong> The pronoun <em>Him</em> refers to Christ. In some languages it might not be clear to whom the pronoun <em>Him</em> refers. If that is true for your language, it may be best to follow the CEV and use the word “Christ” in place of <em>Him</em>.</p><h4>2:11c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:11c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>we will also live with Him;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">then</span> we<sup>(incl)</sup> will also live <span data-bnType=\"implied\">together</span> with him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we will also live with Him:</strong> The phrase <em>live with Him</em> continues the figure of speech from 2:11b and refers to Jesus rising from the dead. After we have “died” to sin and our old behavior, God’s promise is that we receive new spiritual life in him. This includes fellowship with Christ while on the earth and also living with him in heaven.</p>",

The two main views are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means to <u>continue to be a Christian but in some way fail to be faithful to Christ</u>. In other words, it means to be disloyal, or to sin.</p></li><li><p>It means to <u>stop being a Christian</u>. In other words, it means to no longer have faith, or to stop believing in Christ.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you choose a word for <em>faithless</em> that includes the first meaning.</p><h4>2:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He remains faithful,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>he remains faithful <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to us</span>,</p></li><li><p>he <span data-bnType=\"implied\">nevertheless</span> does all that he has said <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he would do</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He remains faithful:</strong> Scholars have understood this part of the verse in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is a promise—Christ remains faithful in the sense that he continues to love believers and have mercy on them even when they are temporarily unfaithful.</p></li><li><p>It is a warning—Christ remains faithful in the sense that he will carry out his promise to disown and punish those who have not repented of their sin.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you translate in a way that readers will understand interpretation (1). It is also recommended that you repeat the same root form for the word <em>faithful</em> as you used for the word “faithless” in 2:13a. This should be done in order to maintain the parallelism of the poem/hymn. See faith in the Glossary, Meaning 3.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>remains:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>remains</em> is in the present tense. Speakers of Greek often used the present tense form of a verb when what they said was a general truth valid at all times. You should use the present tense, as do most other English versions, unless another tense is needed to express general truths in your language.</p><h4>2:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for He cannot deny Himself.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because he cannot contradict himself.</p></li><li><p>for he must be who he is.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for He cannot deny Himself:</strong> This part of 2:13 is the reason why the hymn writer, Paul, is so certain that “Christ remains faithful.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">You may need to translate without the double negative in this clause. In such a case you could say something like, “for he must be who he is.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>deny Himself:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>deny</em> is the same as the Greek word translated “deny” in 2:12. However, it may not be possible to translate it in the same way here. Here the sense of <em>deny Himself</em> is that Christ cannot deny or break his promises. He cannot say one thing and do another; he cannot contradict himself. JBP says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He cannot deny his own nature.</p></blockquote>",

However, Bible scholars are not certain how many of the previous verses Paul was referring to here. He was referring at least to the hymn in 2:11–13. He may also have been referring to all that he had written up to this point. It is best to translate in a general sense so that 2:14a is not limited to any specific thing that Paul mentioned earlier in this letter.</p><h4>2:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>charging them before God</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Warn/tell them in the presence of God</p></li><li><p>Warn/command them, “In the presence/name of God I tell you</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>charging them before God:</strong> This phrase is similar to the wording in 1 Timothy 5:21.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>before God:</strong> This phrase means “in the presence of God.” It is a type of oath that Paul and other people normally used to emphasize that what they said was true. (See Galatians 1:20.) Here, however, Paul instructed Timothy to use this phrase when he talked to the believers in order to emphasize how important his warning was. See the Display for an example of translating this as direct speech.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>with God as your witness (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in the name of God (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>God:</strong> There is a textual issue here.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some Greek manuscripts have <u>God</u>.

It means, “to strongly disagree about the meaning of words and the proper way to use them.” Paul warned Timothy in a similar way in 1 Timothy 6:4.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul could have been referring to the small details of words that do not change the meaning of doctrines. Or he may have been referring to myths, genealogies, and other cultural ideas that he mentioned in 1 Timothy 1:4 and 4:7.</p><h4>2:14d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:14d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>which succeeds only</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>That kind of quarreling/arguing is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">completely</span> useless,</p></li><li><p>That kind of quarreling does not benefit anyone <span data-bnType=\"implied\">at all</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(NASB) which is useless:</strong> When people argued over unimportant differences in meaning, it would not help those who were listening to better understand the word of God.

It means, “to work hard,” “to try hard,” or “to put the most effort that you can into your work.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to present yourself…to God:</strong> The verb <em>to present</em> means “to show” or “to stand before.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The text does not indicate whether Paul was instructing Timothy concerning “presenting” himself to God in the present time or the future. Some scholars think this verse refers to the future judgment day when people will stand before God. Others think this refers to Timothy daily presenting himself to God. It is best to leave the time vague.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>approved to God:</strong> The word <em>approved</em> is an adjective in Greek. It means, “accepted after successfully passing a trial or examination.” God is the one who examines how a person represents him and teaches his word. Timothy must live and teach in the ways he knew that God approved. Then he will be an approved workman of God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">As mentioned above regarding the words “present yourself,” we do not know if Paul is speaking of the past, the present or the future. It may be that God had (already) approved of Timothy as his servant or “workman.” On the other hand, the NCV uses the future: “give yourself to God as the kind of person he will accept.” If possible, do not be specific about the time. One possibility is to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Present yourself to God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in such a way</span> that he can approve you.</p></blockquote><h4>2:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>an unashamed workman</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Be <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> a workman/craftsman who <span data-bnType=\"implied\">works well and who</span> does not need to be ashamed-of/embarrassed-by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his work</span>,</p></li><li><p>Be a worker who can be proud <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of his work</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>an unashamed workman:</strong> This part of the verse describes someone of whom God approves. In some languages, it may be best to follow the example of the NLT and start a new sentence here.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Be a good worker, one who does not need to be ashamed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>workman:</strong> The word in the Greek text that the BSB translates as <em>workman</em> can refer to a person who does general physical work, such as carrying things or digging. But it can also refer to a person whose work requires special skill. Paul here compared Timothy and the way he was working for the Lord to a craftsman who worked well so that he was not ashamed of what he had done.</p><h4>2:15c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:15c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who accurately handles the word of truth.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and who accurately/correctly handles the word of truth.</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">be</span> a worker who correctly/carefully teaches the true message.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who accurately handles the word of truth:</strong> This part of the verse also describes someone of whom God approves. Here Paul again mentioned the second theme of his letter to Timothy: the message about the good news is a special thing that God has entrusted to his people. Those who teach the word of God must never mix erroneous teaching with it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>accurately handles the word of truth:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>accurately handles</em> literally means “to cut straight.” This word further develops the image of a worker in 2:15b. A worker who is not ashamed is one who skillfully uses his tools. Here the “tool” that a Christian worker must correctly handle is the <em>word of truth</em>. Used figuratively, this word refers to “correct teaching.” You have several options for translating this word.</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Keep the figure of speech of a worker and translate it “correctly handles” (NIV) or “accurately handles” (BSB and NASB).

For reasons of style, many English translations such as the NIV omit the conjunction here. The <em>de</em> shows the contrast that Paul was making between the positive statements in 2:15 (“Make every effort” and “the word of truth”) and the negative statement in 2:16a (“Avoid godless chatter”).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>avoid:</strong> The word <em>avoid</em> means that Paul was warning Timothy to stay away from, and not to join in, discussions with people who did not show any evidence that they trusted in God or revered him.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>irreverent, empty chatter:</strong> The BSB translates two words in the Greek text here as <em>irrevertent, empty chatter</em>. These same two words are found in 1 Timothy 6:20. In both places, the words are plural. This is significant in interpreting 2:16b. See interpretation (2) below.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>irreverent:</strong> The word <em>irreverent</em> refers to something that is “secular,” “profane,” or “unholy,” to something that does not honor God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>empty chatter:</strong> The noun the BSB translates as <em>empty chatter</em> means “foolish, empty, idle talk,” “talk about topics that are not important or have no value.”</p><h4>2:16b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:16b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>which will only lead to more ungodliness,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because those people who participate in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">godless discussions</span> will become even more ungodly,</p></li><li><p>The people who do that will become more and more ungodly/corrupt.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>which will only lead to:</strong> Paul gave Timothy two reasons why he should avoid irreverent, empty chatter. The first reason is here in 2:16b. The second reason is in 2:17a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>which will only lead to more ungodliness,:</strong> In Greek, this clause is literally “because to more they-will-increase of ungodliness.” Scholars disagree about whom the subject “they” of the verb “will increase” refers to.

Those who follow this interpretation say that this verse means that the people who chatter in ungodly ways will become more ungodly.

Some English translations (BSB, RSV, NET, GW, NASB, REB) begin this verse with <em>and</em> to show that 2:17a is connected with 2:16.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the talk of such men will spread:</strong> This is the second reason why Timothy should avoid empty chatter.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the talk of such men:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>talk</em> is literally “word.” Here it refers to the “empty chatter” in 2:16a. The words “teaching” or “message” are other ways to translate this word.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>will spread:</strong> The verb phrase <em>will spread</em> means that if the false teachers continued to talk, their message would go out to a wider area and deceive more and more people.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>like gangrene:</strong> The word <em>gangrene</em> is a medical term. It refers to the decay of body tissue that is caused by an infection or disease.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul used <em>gangrene</em> as a figure of speech. Paul was comparing the false teaching to an infected wound. If no one tries to cure the infected wound, the infection will spread to more and more of the person’s body until it poisons him and eventually kills him. In the same way, if Timothy allowed the false teachers to continue teaching false doctrines, more and more people would believe their message and would stop believing the true message. In this way, those people would die spiritually.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you cannot keep the figure of speech, you can say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>their words will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">spread and eventually</span> destroy the faith of the people who listen to it.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">more and more people will hear</span> their teaching and it will damage those who pay attention to it.</p></blockquote><h4>2:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Two of the people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who teach this kind of message</span> are Hymenaeus and Philetus.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus:</strong> This is the first time in this letter that Paul mentioned the names of any of the false teachers. He had spoken of them in 2:17a when he mentions “the talk of such men.” <em>Hymenaeus</em> and <em>Philetus</em> were two of the people who had been teaching the believers ideas that were contrary to the truths of the word of God. Apparently, Timothy knew who both of these men were. Paul mentioned Hymenaeus in 1 Timothy 1:20 and indicated that he had removed Hymenaeus from the Christian congregation in Ephesus.</p>",

But the things they were teaching people at the time that Paul wrote this letter were not true.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>deviated from:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>deviate from</em> originally meant “to miss the mark.” Later it came to mean “to miss, fail, deviate, and depart.” This verb occurs in 1 Timothy 1:6 also.</p><h4>2:18b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:18b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>They say that the resurrection has already occurred,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They say that the resurrection has already happened.</p></li><li><p>They say that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we<sup>(incl)</sup> believers</span> have already been resurrected.</p></li><li><p>These <span data-bnType=\"implied\">men</span> teach that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has already raised <span data-bnType=\"implied\">us<sup>(incl)</sup> believers</span> from the dead <span data-bnType=\"implied\">symbolically/spiritually</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>They say that the resurrection has already occurred:</strong> Here Paul specifically mentioned one of the teachings of the false teachers. They taught that the resurrection had already happened.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the resurrection:</strong> In the New Testament, the word <em>resurrection</em> can refer to:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>the specific, future, universal resurrection of human beings. This term is usually preceded by the definite article: “the resurrection” (John 11:24),</p></li><li><p>the resurrection of Jesus from the grave three days after he was buried (Matthew 27:53).</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Here it refers to (a), the resurrection of human beings. The teaching about the resurrection includes the ideas of eternal life, fellowship with God, and rewards for living in a way that pleases God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>has already occurred:</strong> Scholars do not agree about what the false teachers meant when they said that the resurrection had <em>already occurred</em>. However, most scholars say that these heretics taught the following: when people believed the good news about Jesus Christ, God “resurrected” them symbolically or spiritually. This heretical teaching implied that since the resurrection was symbolic only, believers could not look forward to life in a resurrected, physical body after they died.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Try to leave all this information implicit in your translation. You may want to consider putting it in a footnote.</p><h4>2:18c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:18c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and they undermine the faith of some.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">As a result,</span> they are ruining the faith of some <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the believers</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">As a result,</span> they are causing some <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the believers</span> to stop believing <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ’s teachings</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and they undermine the faith of some:</strong> Apparently some of the people in the congregation at Ephesus had believed this new teaching and now doubted what they had believed before.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>undermine:</strong> The verb that the BSB translates as <em>undermine</em> means “destroy,” “to overthrow” or “to overturn.” This same verb is used in Titus 1:11 where the BSB translates it as “undermine.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">According to 1 Corinthians 15:12–19, a key element of the Christian faith is belief in the resurrection of the body. So when the false teachers convinced people that there would be no resurrection of the body, they were indeed “undermining their faith.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The verb for <em>undermine</em> is in the present tense. This indicates that at the time Paul was writing this letter to Timothy, these false teachers were actively deceiving believers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>faith:</strong> Here, Paul used the word <em>faith</em> in the sense of the basic teachings that Christians believe and practice The false teachers were causing the believers to stop believing in Christ and his teachings.

The idea is that heretics might destroy the faith of some believers, <u>but</u> they cannot destroy God’s foundation. Other English versions translate this word as “but” or “however.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God’s firm foundation stands:</strong> In some cultures, people who are constructing a building begin by putting large stones in the ground as a foundation. Then they build the walls of the building on this foundation. This causes the building to be more stable. Here, Paul used the image of a foundation in a figurative sense.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">He was referring to the church, that is, the people who believe the teachings of Jesus. In the same way that the foundation stones of a building never move, the body of true believers always continues to trust firmly in Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are several options for translating this phrase:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate it literally using the figure of a foundation, as many English translations do.</p></li><li><p>Translate the phrase using a simile. In this case, you will have to refer to the church/believers as part of the translation. For example,</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The true believers in God are strong in their faith like the strong foundation of a building.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Replace the figure of speech with the direct meaning. An example of this would be:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s people always stand/remain firm.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s people always continue to believe the truth.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>stands:</strong> Most English versions translate the Greek verb as “stands,” “stands firm,” or “remains standing.” The idea is that the foundation cannot break, nor can anyone destroy it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This verb indicates that the church consists of people who have believed and continue to strongly believe the message of God’s word even when others have chosen to stop believing it.</p><h4>2:19b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:19b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>bearing this seal:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>These <span data-bnType=\"implied\">two</span> sayings are written on this foundation:</p></li><li><p>On this foundation <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> wrote these words:</p></li><li><p>God has said/written:</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>bearing this seal:</strong> Paul continued to use the figure of speech of a foundation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>bearing this seal</em> is literally “having this seal.” In the time of Paul, people would make a mark or carve words on the foundation stones of a building to show who owned the building. Sometimes the writing also told the purpose of the building. This mark or writing was called a “seal.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In cultures where people do not build on large stones or write on them, you may need to supply a footnote. This footnote could describe buildings that people build on stone foundations and it could explain what these stones are for. The note could also say what kinds of things people write on the foundation stones of their buildings.</p><h4>2:19c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:19c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“The Lord knows those who are His,”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The first saying is:</span> “The Lord knows which people are his.”</p></li><li><p>“The Lord knows which people really belong to him.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>“The Lord knows those who are His”:</strong> This saying comes from Numbers 16:5 in the Greek translation of the Old Testament. It means that God knows which people believe firmly in him. He knows who is part of his church and who is not.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Lord:</strong> The word <em>Lord</em> refers to God.</p><h4>2:19d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:19d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord must turn away from iniquity.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And “When someone says ‘The Lord is my master,’ that person must abandon evil.”</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">And the other saying is:</span> “Those who say that they are followers of the Lord must stop doing wrong/evil.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord must turn away from iniquity”:</strong> Various parts of this saying resemble parts of verses in the Old Testament, but there is no one verse in the Old Testament that contains this entire saying. Therefore, it is uncertain whether Paul wanted to quote from the Old Testament or whether he made this a summary statement of principles from the Old Testament. Nevertheless, because it is one of the two sayings that Paul lists, use the same form of punctuation as you did in the first saying.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>calls on the name of the Lord:</strong> The Greek phrase which the BSB translates as <em>calls on the name of the Lord</em> means that the person claims that the Lord is his/her master or leader. TEV says: “Whoever says that they belong to the Lord must turn away from wrongdoing.”</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the Lord:</strong> As in 2:19c, <em>the Lord</em> here refers to God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>turn away from iniquity:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>turn away</em> also means “abandon,” “desert,” or “renounce.” The NCV translates this clause clearly when it says: “must stop doing wrong.”</p>",

The <em>de</em> indicates that Paul was changing from one figure of speech (a foundation in 2:19) to another figure (a house). Some English versions have tried to indicate the change of figure with the conjunction “Now,” like the NASB has done. But here, the English word “Now” does not have its normal meaning of “at this time.” Rather, it indicates a connection between topics, not simply between sentences. Many English versions omit translating the conjunction but indicate the change of subject by beginning a new paragraph.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>A large house:</strong> The term <em>large house</em> refers to the house of a rich person. The NLT translates this term as “wealthy home.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>vessels:</strong> The term <em>vessels</em> here refers to things like dishes, bowls, and jars. Some languages have a generic term like “containers” or “articles” for all of these items. Other languages do not have one generic word but can list some specific items, as in GNT, which says, “dishes and bowls of all kinds.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are many different kinds of dishes, bowls, and other containers in the house of a wealthy person. In the same way, there are many different types of people in the church.</p><h4>2:20b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:20b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>of gold and silver,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>are made of gold, and some <span data-bnType=\"implied\">pots and dishes</span> are made of silver.</p></li><li><p>are made of gold or of silver.</p></li></ul></div><h4>2:20c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:20c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but also of wood and clay.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>There are others that are made of wood or pottery/clay.</p></li><li><p>Some <span data-bnType=\"implied\">pots and dishes</span> are made of wood and clay.</p></li></ul></div><h4>2:20b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay:</strong> The dishes and pots are not all of equal value.

Many English versions omit this word, but it is recommended that you translate this conjunction so that readers understand the purpose of 2:21. You can follow the example of the BSB (<em>So</em>) or the NASB (“Therefore”). If you need a more explicit way to show that Paul was explaining his image, you can say something like “The lesson is that…” or “In the same way….”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if anyone cleanses himself:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>cleanses</em> means “to thoroughly clean.” It is a rare word that occurs only here and in 1 Corinthians 5:7. Paul used the word <em>cleanses</em> in a spiritual sense. It means that someone has cleansed (or removed) sin from his life or that he has repented from sin. In this context, the sin was accepting the false teachers and their doctrines.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>of what is unfit:</strong> In the Greek text, this phrase is literally “from <u>these</u>.” There are two views about the meaning of the word “these.”</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers specifically to the <u>common</u> purposes that Paul mentioned at the end of 2:20. In this view, the phrase means that believers should stay away from the false teachers and their doctrines. For example, the RSV says,</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If any one purifies himself from what is ignoble… <em>See also NIV, NET.</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to <u>evil</u> or <u>wickedness</u> in general that Paul mentioned in 2:16–19d. For example, the REB says,</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Anyone who cleanses himself from all this wickedness… <em>See also GNT, CEV, NCV, JBP.</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><h4>2:21b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:21b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>he will be a vessel for honor:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>he will be <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> a container <span data-bnType=\"implied\">used</span> for noble/honorable purposes.</p></li><li><p>will be <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">fine/valuable</span> dish/bowl <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that people/we<sup>(incl)</sup> use</span> for a celebration,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he will be a vessel for honor:</strong> Paul continued to use the same figure of speech. The word <em>he</em> refers to Christians who reject false teachers and their doctrines. Paul compared these Christians to containers/vessels that are <em>for honor</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>vessel:</strong> This is the same word as in 2:20a and refers to the containers that are made of gold and silver.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>honor:</strong> This is the same term in Greek as in 2:20d–e. It refers to containers that people used for special food.</p><h4>2:21c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:21c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>sanctified, useful to the Master,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He has been</span> made holy, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and so</span> his owner/master will be able to use him.</p></li><li><p>His <span data-bnType=\"implied\">life</span> will be holy/pure, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and so</span> his owner/master will be able to use him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>sanctified:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>sanctified</em> means “set apart,” or “reserved” “made holy” for God’s use. See holy in the Glossary, Meaning 1.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This verb is passive. The text does not say who sanctified the person, so if possible, you should use a passive verb. If, however, you need to supply a subject, you can say something like “The Master has made him holy….” If you need to make it active instead of passive you can say, “His life will be pure.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>useful:</strong> The Master can “use” a person who is holy.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Master:</strong> Here Paul continued the figure of speech about a house. <em>The Master</em> represents God. Paul compared God, who is the Christians’ master, to the master/owner of the house.</p><h4>2:21d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:21d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and prepared for every good work.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He is</span> prepared/ready to do any <span data-bnType=\"implied\">kind of</span> good deed.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and prepared for every good work:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>prepared</em> is literally “having been prepared.” It is a passive verb. As with the term “sanctified” in 2:21c, the text does not say who “prepared” the person. If necessary, you can say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Master has prepared him for any good deed.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, a better way to translate <em>prepared</em> is to use a verb that means “to be ready.” For example, the NLT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you will be ready for the Master to use you for every good work.</p></blockquote>",

It indicates that Paul was changing his topic from the figure of speech about the different containers and their uses to another topic. Many English versions, including BSB, NIV and GNT, do not translate this conjunction, but indicate the change of topic by beginning a new paragraph.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Flee from:</strong> Other ways to translate the verb phrase <em>Flee from</em> are “run from,” “stay away from,” or “avoid.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the figure of speech about the containers in a large house, Paul had indirectly encouraged Timothy. Here with the verb <em>Flee</em> he directly commanded him. If the change seems too abrupt, perhaps your language has a way to mark this change. One way to do this is to begin the command with “Timothy” as you will see in the first Meaning Line of the Display.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>youthful passions:</strong> The phrase <em>youthful passions</em> means “the evil things that young people want to do.” The NLT translates this phrase “youthful lusts” and the NIV translates it as “evil desires of youth.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>passions:</strong> Other ways of translating the word that the BSB translates as <em>passions</em> are “desires” and “impulses.” Paul was probably referring to sexual desires. He may also have been referring to selfish ambition, impatience, and doing unwise, impulsive things.</p><h4>2:22b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:22b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and pursue righteousness,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Instead,</span> run towards what is right,</p></li><li><p>and make an effort to do <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what is</span> right <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and just</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>pursue:</strong> The verb <em>pursue</em> is the opposite of “flee” in 2:22a. Flee means “to run away from,” and <em>pursue</em> means “to run towards.” Paul used these two verbs figuratively. He used “flee” to mean, “do not…” and <em>pursue</em> to mean, “make an effort to….” The NLT says: “Follow anything that makes you want to do right.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The four abstract nouns that follow the word <em>pursue</em> describe character traits that Paul urged Timothy to develop. It may be necessary for you to use verb phrases or complete clauses to express what these abstract nouns mean.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>righteousness:</strong> Because Paul was talking about character traits here, <em>righteousness</em> in this context probably refers to the way that we behave. It means “to live in a way that God considers right, and to do what is right and just to other people.” Paul was probably not talking here about the righteousness that God attributes to us because we trust in Jesus Christ. That kind of righteousness does not depend on our good character or on anything that we have done or could do. See also righteousness in the Glossary, Meaning 1.</p><h4>2:22c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:22c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>faith, love, and peace,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>be faithful/dependable, love <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other people</span>, and live in peace <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with them</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>faith:</strong> It is not clear in which sense Paul used this word here. There are two interpretations:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “faithfulness,” that is, being honest, truthful, and dependable either toward God or other people.</p></li><li><p>It means “belief or trust in God.”</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">If possible, translate in a general way so that people could understand both interpretations. If that is not possible and you must make a choice, choose interpretation (1). See faith in the Glossary, Meaning 3.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>love:</strong> In this context, <em>love</em> refers to love for other people, not love for God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>peace:</strong> The word <em>peace</em> refers to living in harmony with other people.</p><h4>2:22d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:22d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>together with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You are to pursue these things</span> along with the people who worship the Lord with a clean heart.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You</span> and those who worship/pray to the Lord with sincerity <span data-bnType=\"implied\">are to pursue these things</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>together with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart:</strong> Scholars disagree about what this phrase goes with. There are two interpretations:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It applies to all four nouns that follow the verb “pursue.” So both Timothy and <em>those who call on the Lord</em> are to pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace.</p></li><li><p>It applies only to the word peace. So Timothy is to live in peace <em>with those who call on the Lord</em>.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>those who call on the Lord:</strong> This phrase means “people who pray to the Lord.” It refers to those who follow the Lord and worship him. It is similar to the phrase “everyone who confesses the name of the Lord” in 2:19d.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the Lord:</strong> Here <em>the Lord</em> probably refers to God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a pure heart:</strong> The term <em>pure heart</em> means “sincerely” or “without deceit.” In many languages there is an idiom to express this aspect of a person’s character. Consider whether your language also uses an idiom. Use it if it is appropriate.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:22</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">One possible way to translate 2:22 is to put 2:22d earlier in the verse as follows:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Timothy, run away from the evil things that other young men do. You and those who worship the Lord with clean hearts should search for ways to do what is right, faithful, loving, and peaceful.</p></blockquote></div>",

It was possible that Timothy’s opponents would repent, but not certain.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>that God may grant them:</strong> The meaning of the clause <em>that God may grant them</em> is “that God will make it possible for them,” “…enable them,” or “…allow them” to repent.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>repentance:</strong> In this context <em>repentance</em> refers to a major change in what a person believes and how he behaves: That is, the person turns away from false teachings and now believes the true teachings of God. He turns away from sinful choices and now chooses to do things that please God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">As the phrase indicates, God is the one who makes repentance possible. A person cannot change himself in this way without God’s help.</p><h4>2:25c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:25c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>leading to a knowledge of the truth.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and help/allow them to recognize what is true,</p></li><li><p>and to know what are the true teachings <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about Christ</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>leading to a knowledge of the truth:</strong> The literal translation of this phrase from the Greek is “into acknowledgement of the truth.” This grammatical construction makes it difficult to know how this phrase is connected to 2:25b. Most translations consider <em>a knowledge of the truth</em> to be the result of “repentance” in 2:25b. Therefore, they translate it:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>perhaps God will allow them to repent and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">then</span> come to know the truth</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>perhaps God will enable them to repent and will lead them to know the truth.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a knowledge of the truth:</strong> This phrase means “to know or recognize the true teachings.” (See the note on this phrase in Translator’s Notes for Titus 1:1d.)</p>",

Some English versions use the word &quot;and” (NIV, RSV, NASB, NCV). Other versions make the connection more explicit with the word “Then” (BSB, NLT, GW). The GNT uses both words: “And then….”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It may be necessary to repeat the verb “will gently reprove” from 2:25a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they will come to their senses and escape:</strong> This clause uses figurative language. It describes the next step a person who has believed wrong doctrine takes as he is restored to true faith.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek text that the BSB translates as <em>they will come to their senses and escape</em> is a single verb in Greek. The verb literally means “to come to one’s senses,” or “to start thinking correctly again (after being deceived).” Scholars do not agree about whether to express this using two verbs or one:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Most English versions use <u>two verbs</u> and believe that the verb “escape” is implicit: People who oppose the true teachings of Christ are like people who have been deceived and can no longer think clearly, and they are like people who are caught in a trap. For example, GNT says,</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And then they will come to their senses and escape…. <em>See also BSB, NIV, NJB, NLT, GW, NET, REB, NASB.</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Other English versions use a <u>single verb</u>. People who oppose the true teachings of Christ are like people who are caught in a trap. For example, the RSV says,</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and they may escape…. <em>See also CEV and KJV.</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1) and the majority of versions and use two verbs.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is the only place in the New Testament where this verb occurs. To “come to one’s senses” is an idiom in English, so avoid translating it literally unless you have the same idiom in your language. If not, use a word or phrase that describes someone who recovers from being unable to think clearly.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>escape the snare of the devil:</strong> The word <em>escape</em> is not in the Greek text, but it is clearly implied in the phrase. Paul was thinking about the way an animal gets caught in a trap and cannot get free. In a similar way, the devil has tricked the person into rejecting the truth and believing what is false. It is as though that person is an animal in a trap, but the trap is one that the devil has set. However, when a person “repents” (by accepting the truth of God’s word), he becomes free from the devil’s power. He is like an animal that has escaped from a trap and he can think clearly again and be able to recognize what is true and what is false.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If your language does not have a similar figure of speech, you can say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>…escape from the power/control of the devil.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>devil:</strong> The devil is the chief of all evil spirits. The name of the <em>devil</em> is Satan. See devil in the Glossary.</p><h4>2:26b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:26b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who has taken them captive to his will.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He had captured/trapped them to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">make them</span> do what he wanted <span data-bnType=\"implied\">them to do</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The devil</span> has deceived them to make them do what he wants.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>taken them captive to his will:</strong> Satan’s purpose for capturing men and women is to make them do what he wants. Satan influences people to reject God’s true message and believe his false message.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:25–26</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:26 Paul mentions two events, which the Greek lists in the following order: <em>(a)</em> people escape from Satan’s trap, and <em>(b)</em> Satan traps them. The BSB and most other English versions follow the Greek order, but the chronological order is the opposite. For that reason, in some languages it may be necessary to reorder the parts of the verse as follows:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>26b</sup>The devil has trapped people to make them obey him. <sup>25a</sup>We (incl) must gently correct these people who are against us <sup>25b</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">so</span> that perhaps God will enable them to change their hearts/thinking <sup>25c</sup>and to recognize what is true, <sup>26a</sup>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so</span> that they may come to their senses and escape from the devil’s trap.</p></blockquote></div>",

It is often translated “for” or “because.” This conjunction indicates that Paul was about to tell Timothy the reason why he should “have nothing to do” with those people who appear to be religious but who are actually ungodly. For reasons of style, the BSB and some other English versions have left this word untranslated.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>They are the kind:</strong> The Greek indicates that Paul was going to begin talking about <u>some</u> of the people in 3:2–5. GNT has “Some of them….” The RSV has “among them are those….”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">These people seemed to be Christians, but they were not. They were false teachers who deceived people for their own gain and influenced them with their false teachings.</p><h4>3:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who worm their way into households</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>are deceiving/fooling others to get into their houses</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who worm their way into households:</strong> The clause <em>worm their way</em> is an English idiom. You should not translate it literally.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>worm their way</em> literally means “to creep into” or “to sneak into.” In this context, it means that these false teachers deceived people to get invited into their homes. This word does not mean that they entered houses secretly without the inhabitants being aware that someone had entered.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>households:</strong> This word refers to the people who live in the house. The false teachers tried to deceive individuals so that they would be welcomed into the rest of the family.</p><h4>3:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and captivate vulnerable women</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and deceive foolish women <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who live there</span>,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Then when they enter those homes,</span> they trick gullible women.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and captivate vulnerable women:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as<em>captivate</em> literally means “to take as a captive in war.” Paul used it figuratively here, implying that the false teachers were “gain control over,” “capturing the minds” or “deceiving” some of the women in order to have influence over them. In this context it does not imply that they used force or that they literally kept them as prisoners.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>vulnerable women:</strong> The Greek noun that the BSB translates as <em>vulnerable women</em> literally means “little women.” This particular form of the Greek word for “women” referred to the type of women who were immature in the way they thought about things. These women readily believed whatever the false teachers told them and would do whatever they asked them to do. Therefore other people did not respect them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate this word are “weak-willed women,” “unwise women” or “foolish women.”</p><h4>3:6d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:6d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who are weighed down with sins</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>who are burdened by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the guilt of</span> their sins.</p></li><li><p>These women have sinned <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so many times that it feels like</span> they are carrying a burden.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who are weighed down with sins:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>weighed down</em> literally means “to heap” or “to pile up.” This is figurative language meaning that these women had sinned so much that their sins were a “burden to them,” or their many sins “troubled their minds.” They felt very guilty about the many wrong things that they had done.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>with sins:</strong> Paul did not describe the specific sins that these women had committed. The text uses the expression “by various passions” in 3:6e which suggests that these women had probably sinned in several different ways.</p><h4>3:6e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:6e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and led astray by various passions,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They are being led by all kinds of evil desires/passions.</p></li><li><p>All kinds of evil desires control them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and led astray:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>led astray</em> is a passive verb. It means “to be swayed,” “to be guided,” or “to be controlled” by something.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by various passions:</strong> This implies that these women had committed several different types of sins.</p>",

Their names are not mentioned in the Old Testament, but they are known from Jewish tradition. (See Exodus 7:11–22 and Exodus 8:7–19.) These two magicians wanted to show Pharaoh that their power was as great as the power that Moses had from the true God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In your translation, it may be helpful to add a footnote explaining briefly what Paul meant when he referred to <em>Jannes</em> and <em>Jambres</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>These men were magicians who opposed Moses in Pharaoh’s court.

This is the first description.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>depraved:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>depraved</em> also means “corrupt” or “ruined.” Paul used a form of this Greek word in 1 Timothy 6:5.</p><h4>3:8d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:8d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and disqualified from the faith.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they</span> are worthless in matters regarding the faith.</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they</span> are failures concerning the teachings that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we</span> believe.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and disqualified from the faith:</strong> This statement is the second description of those men who opposed the truth.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>disqualified:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>disqualified</em> means “not passing the test,” “failed,” “rejected,” “worthless,” or “unfit.” It is the opposite of the word “approved” in 2:15a.

By using the pronoun as the very first word, Paul clearly contrasts Timothy with the false teachers of 3:1–9. Use the words or grammatical pattern in your language that also show such contrast. For example, you could say: “But as for you….”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In addition, since this verse begins a new section, it might be helpful for the readers if you repeat Timothy’s name. You might say, “But as for you, Timothy….”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>have observed:</strong> The clause <em>have observed</em> is the BSB translation of one Greek verb. Some English versions have translated this verb literally as “follow.” (See GNT, NET, NASB, NCV, NJB.) Other versions have translated this verb metaphorically as “know” in the sense of “follow with the mind.” (See the NIV, KJV, GW, NLT, CEV, JBP.) Paul used this same verb in 1 Timothy 4:6.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is important for you to notice that this one verb relates to all nine items that Paul listed in 3:10a–3:11a. In Greek, the verb occurs only once, but in many languages, it is necessary to repeat the verb at some point or to use a different verb before some of the things that Paul listed. Two English versions (GNT, NCV) that translate the Greek verb as “follow” in 3:10a change the verb to “observe” or “know” when they repeat a verb later in the list.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In translating this verb, you have at least the following two choices:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Follow the example of the BSB and begin the list with a verb that can be used with all of the items in the list. The BSB uses “have observed.”</p></li><li><p>Follow the example of the NCV and use one verb for part of the list and another verb for the rest of the list, when it becomes necessary. The NCV uses “follow” and “know.”</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>my teaching:</strong> When Paul said <em>my teaching</em> he was referring to all of the doctrines that he had taught. He considered all of these doctrines to be closely related to each other and spoke of them as a group.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>my:</strong> In the Greek text this pronoun occurs just once before this first item in the list of things that Timothy knew about Paul’s life and teaching. In that position it indicates that <em>my</em> applies to each item in the list from 3:10a–11a. The BSB repeats the word <em>my</em> for each item in the list, but you should follow the patterns for proper pronoun use in your language as you translate each of the items in 3:10b–11a. You must not feel that you have to follow the Greek or any English grammatical pattern.</p><h4>3:10b–11a</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 3:10b–11a, Paul listed some of the things that characterized the way that he had served Christ. He reminded Timothy about some things that Timothy already knew about Paul and how he had served the Lord and suffered because he preached the gospel. Paul implied that he hoped Timothy would remember these characteristics and imitate them. In some languages, it may be necessary to use verbs or whole sentences to translate each of the abstract nouns that Paul used in 3:10b–11a.</p><h4>3:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>my conduct,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You know</span> the way I live.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>my conduct:</strong> The phrase <em>my conduct</em> is the translation of one Greek word. It indicates that Timothy knew that Paul had lived in a way that was right according to God’s word. He also knew that Paul behaved in the same righteous manner that he instructed the believers to follow.</p><h4>3:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>my purpose,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You know what</span> my purpose/plan is.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You know</span> what I want/try to do.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>my purpose:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>purpose</em> also occurs in 1:9d. Some other ways to translate this word are “plan,” “intention,” “goal,” or “what I want to do.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul’s purpose in life was to preach God’s word to others. When groups of Christians formed congregations as a result of his preaching, it was also Paul’s purpose to teach them even more truths from the word of God, so that they would develop spiritually.</p><h4>3:10d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:10d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>my faith,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You know that I</span> trust/believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>faith:</strong> In Paul’s letters, the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>faith</em> has at least three meanings:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>a Christian’s belief or trust in God,</p></li><li><p>the basic doctrines that Christians believe,</p></li><li><p>faithfulness or trustworthiness.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">In this verse, Paul probably used the word <em>faith</em> in the first sense. Here Paul said that Timothy knew how much he (Paul) trusted God. See faith in the Glossary, Meaning 1.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">See the note in 3:10a about the word “my.”</p><h4>3:10e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:10e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>my patience, my love,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You know that I have been</span> patient <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with all kinds of people</span>, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and that I have</span> loved <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all kinds of people</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>patience:</strong> The word <em>patience</em> refers to being able to endure something that is unpleasant without complaining. Here Paul was referring to his own patience towards other people as he traveled to different places preaching and teaching the good news.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>love:</strong> Here Paul was referring to his love for other people, not his love for God. Paul did not define <em>love</em> as an emotional feeling. He defined it as an attitude of caring about the well-being of other people.</p><h4>3:10f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:10f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>my perseverance,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You know that I have</span> endured <span data-bnType=\"implied\">difficulties</span></p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You know that I</span> persist/continue <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in doing my work</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>perseverance:</strong> This word means almost the same thing as the word “patience” in 3:10e. The word <em>perseverance</em> refers to being able to continue doing whatever one is doing, even in difficult circumstances. Timothy knew about Paul’s <em>perseverance</em> because he knew that Paul had continued to preach and teach even when he was living in difficult circumstances and when people were reluctant to accept his teaching.</p>",

People who did not agree with Paul’s religious beliefs had regularly said and done things to discredit or harm him. They did those things so he would stop preaching about Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>sufferings:</strong> The word <em>sufferings</em> refers to the physical pain that Paul had experienced because people persecuted him.</p><h4>3:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that came upon me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You know about</span> the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">awful</span> kinds of things that happened to me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You know about</span> the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">terrible</span> kinds of things that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people did</span> to me in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the towns of</span> Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that came upon me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra:</strong> Here Paul named some specific places where his “persecutions and sufferings” had occurred.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra:</strong> These are the names of three towns. Before translating this verse read what Luke wrote about Paul’s visits to these towns, in Acts 13:44–14:23. <em>Lystra</em> was the town where the Jews provoked the crowd to stone Paul. It was also the town where Timothy and his parents lived. So even though Paul did not specifically mention “stoning,” Timothy knew what Paul meant when he said <em>that came upon me</em>.</p><h4>3:11c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:11c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>What persecutions I endured!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You know that</span> I endured <span data-bnType=\"implied\">repeated</span> persecution <span data-bnType=\"implied\">there</span></p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You know that people there</span> persecuted me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">many times</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>What persecutions I endured!:</strong> There was no punctuation in the original Greek manuscripts of the New Testament. Therefore Bible scholars have different opinions about how this clause relates to the rest of the sentence and what its function is. The main interpretations are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It restates the previous clause (3:11b) about what had happened to Paul in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. For example, the NJB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>11a</sup>and the persecutions and sufferings <sup>11b</sup>that came to me in places like Antioch, Iconium and Lystra—<sup>11c</sup>all the persecutions I have endured: <em>See also NIV, RSV, GNT, NASB, REB, KJV.</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is the first clause of the following sentence. For example, the NET says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>11a</sup>as well as the persecutions and sufferings <sup>11b</sup>that happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium, and in Lystra. <sup>11c</sup>I endured these persecutions <sup>11d</sup>and the Lord delivered me from them all. <em>See also GW, NCV, NLT, LSA.</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) as do the majority of translations.</p><h4>3:11d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:11d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But the Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus</span> rescued me from all <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the persecutions</span>.</p></li><li><p>But the Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus</span> delivered me from all <span data-bnType=\"implied\">these difficult situations</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them:</strong> There were times when the people who persecuted Paul almost killed him. But the Lord had protected and rescued him from each of these difficult situations.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Yet:</strong> The Greek conjunction <em>kai</em>, which the BSB translates here as <em>Yet</em>, is the most common way to join sentences in Greek. Its most basic meaning is “and.” Here, 3:11d seems to be in contrast with 3:11c. So an English conjunction like “but” shows contrast much better than “and.” GNT, KJV, NLT, and NCV all translate this word as “but.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Lord:</strong> Here the word <em>Lord</em> most likely refers to Jesus, not God the Father.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If there is a term in your language for <em>Lord</em> that can refer to both God the Father and to Jesus, use it. If not, use a word that specifically refers to Jesus, for example, “the Lord Jesus.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>them:</strong> The pronoun <em>them</em> refers to the persecutions in 3:11c.</p>",

Paul had more to say about persecution. After reminding Timothy that he had suffered for the Lord, he used these words to introduce a general statement about suffering.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">You have at least two options for translating these Greek words here:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Choose a conjunction or grammatical feature in your language that would indicate that Paul was introducing a general statement. Another phrase in English similar to <em>Indeed</em> is “in fact.”</p></li><li><p>Leave the words untranslated, as do the GNT, REB, CEV, and NCV.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>godly lives:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>godly</em> also means “devout,” “pious,” or “religious.” All who live <em>godly lives</em> are those who submit themselves to God and act in ways that please God. Some ways to translate <em>godly lives</em> are: “live/act in a way that pleases God” or “do that which pleases God.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in Christ Jesus:</strong> The phrase <em>in Christ Jesus</em> refers to those who “believe in Christ Jesus.” This phrase further defines the group of people who will be persecuted (3:12b). Those who will be persecuted are those who want to live a godly life and who believe <em>in Christ Jesus</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ Jesus:</strong> Notice that in this verse Paul referred to <em>Jesus</em> as <em>Christ Jesus</em> instead of “Jesus Christ.” The names <em>Christ Jesus</em> and “Jesus Christ” mean the same thing. In most English translations and other national language translations, “Jesus Christ” and “Christ Jesus” are translated literally and in the same order as they occur in the Greek manuscripts. It is recommended that you do the same thing. However, if the people who will be reading your translation might be confused when they see two different word orders of the names, you may decide to translate <em>Christ Jesus</em> as “Jesus Christ,” which is the more familiar word order.</p><h4>3:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>will be persecuted,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>will be persecuted <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by unbelievers</span>.</p></li><li><p>will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">encounter people who will</span> persecute him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will be persecuted:</strong> The Greek verb is passive, as the BSB shows. If you need to make the verb active, you can say something similar to this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Indeed, people will persecute everyone who desires to live a godly life….</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you use an active verb, be sure that the emphasis remains on the word “everyone,” not on the clause “people will persecute.” The second Meaning Line in the Display gives another example of how you can change the passive verb into an active one.</p>",

Another way to say this is that Timothy had “learned” the holy Scriptures.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Holy Scriptures:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Scriptures</em> is literally “writings.” There were many “writings” in that day, so the word <em>Holy</em> specified that these “writings” were the “sacred writings” or the books of the Bible that we now call the Old Testament.

They are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“All <u>Scripture is God-breathed</u> and is useful….” This is the interpretation presented above. For example, GNT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching…. <em>See also BSB, NIV, RSV, NET, NASB, KJV, NJB, GW, NLT, CEV, JBP, NCV.</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>“All <u>God-breathed Scripture</u> is useful….” This second interpretation is based on the fact that there is no word in the Greek text between “Scripture” and “God-breathed.” The REB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>All inspired scripture has its use for teaching…. <em>See also the footnotes in GNT, NRSV, NET.</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Also, if the major language version in use in your area has a footnote here to show interpretation (2), it is recommended that you also include a footnote about it.</p></div><h4>3:16c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:16c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for instruction,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>for teaching <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span>,</p></li><li><p>to teach <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people God’s message/truth</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for instruction:</strong> Paul said that Timothy should use Scripture to teach people. If you need to indicate what the Scriptures teach and to whom it is taught. You could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>All Scripture…is useful for teaching people God’s message…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>All Scripture…is useful for teaching people the truth….</p></blockquote><h4>3:16d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:16d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for conviction,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>for rebuking/reprimanding <span data-bnType=\"implied\">them</span>,</p></li><li><p>to tell <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people that what they have done</span> is wrong,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for conviction:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>conviction</em> means “to tell people that what they are believing or doing is wrong.” When Paul used this word, he was probably thinking of the false teachers who believed and taught false doctrine. Another way to translate this word in English is “rebuke” or “reprimand.” This Greek word occurs only here and as a verb in 4:2c (translated as “reprove”) and in 1 Timothy 5:20 (translated as “rebuked”).</p><h4>3:16e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:16e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for correction,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>for correcting <span data-bnType=\"implied\">errors/faults</span>,</p></li><li><p>to correct people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when they do something that is wrong</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>correction:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>correction</em> probably refers to correcting both wrong beliefs that people had and the wrong ways that they were behaving, and then showing them what was right.

Normally, Paul used oaths when he wanted to emphasize that what he was saying was true. For example, in Galatians 1:20, Paul wrote, “I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here, however, Paul used an oath to emphasize the commands that follow in 4:2. Paul used also this same type of oath in 1 Timothy 5:21.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek, this verse begins with a verb that means, “to solemnly urge,” or “to command.” The sentence then continues, naming God and Christ Jesus as the authorities before whom Paul gave Timothy the command that follows in 4:2. The BSB follows the order of the Greek clauses throughout this verse.</p><h4>4:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I charge you</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ I command you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Timothy</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I charge you:</strong> The phrase <em>I charge you</em> is the translation of one Greek word.

He will determine whether each person is innocent or guilty of breaking God’s law and what their reward or punishment will be.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the living:</strong> This refers to those <u>people</u> who will be alive at the time when Christ returns.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and the dead:</strong> This refers to those <u>people</u> who have died before Christ returns.</p><h4>4:1d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:1d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and in view of His appearing and His kingdom:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and because of his coming/returning <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to the earth</span> and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because of</span> his kingdom,</p></li><li><p>and because he will return and become king <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of everyone</span>,</p></li><li><p>when he appears to rule <span data-bnType=\"implied\">over the people of this world</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and in view of His appearing and His kingdom:</strong> Paul used this entire phrase to further emphasize his oath. The phrase <em>in view of</em> is the BSB translation of a Greek grammatical form that people used when they made an oath. Some English versions say “by his appearing and his kingdom.” You should choose a word or phrase in your language that people use when they make an oath.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His appearing:</strong> The phrase <em>His appearing</em> refers to the time when Christ will return to the earth and be visible to everyone.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and His kingdom:</strong> The phrase <em>His kingdom</em> refers to the time when Christ will rule all the people in the world.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:1</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be better to end the oath with the clause in which Paul gives Timothy a <em>charge</em> as the NIV has done:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I give you this charge:</p></blockquote></div>",

Paul had already mentioned the “word” in 2:9c (“the word of God”) and 2:15c (“the word of truth”). Here, Paul commanded Timothy to proclaim publicly that good news from God and the truthful things it teaches.</p><h4>4:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>be prepared in season and out of season;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Be ready/prepared <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to preach the word of God</span> when the circumstances are good/convenient and when they are not good.</p></li><li><p>Be ready <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to preach it</span> when people want to hear it and when they do not want to hear it.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>be prepared:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>be prepared</em> can have two meanings.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means to be <u>prepared</u> or <u>ready</u> to preach the word of God. For example, GW says,</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Be ready to spread the word…. <em>See BSB, NIV, NASB, NCV, LSA.</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means to be <u>insistent</u> on or <u>persistent</u> in preaching the word of God. Timothy must not let anything stop him. For example, the NET says,</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>preach the message, be persistent…. <em>See RSV, GNT, NJB, REB, NLT, KJV.</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). However, if many people in your area use a version in the national language that follows interpretation (2), you should use interpretation (2) or at least mention it in a footnote.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in season and out of season:</strong> This means that Timothy had to be ready to preach God’s word at all times, both when it seemed convenient/favorable to preach and also when it did not seem convenient.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages may need to say to whom or for whom the time was convenient. These languages will need to indicate whether <em>in season and out of season</em> refers to:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>whether <u>people</u> wanted to hear the gospel or not,</p></li><li><p>whether <u>Timothy</u> felt like preaching the gospel or not</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">If possible, translate <em>in season and out of season</em> without specifying to/for whom the preaching would be convenient.

Another way to translate this word in English is “correct” or “reprimand.” This same verb occurs in 3:16d where the BSB translates it as “conviction”, and in 1 Timothy 5:20 (translated as “rebuked”).</p><h4>4:2d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:2d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>rebuke,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">and</span> strongly tell them to stop doing what is wrong/evil.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">and</span> tell them to stop doing it.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>rebuke:</strong> Paul also instructed Timothy to <em>rebuke</em> people who are sinning. This verb has a similar meaning to “reprove” in 4:2c but it is more specific and emphatic. It means, “to strongly tell people who are doing wrong to stop doing it.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Trench, Synonyms.</span></span></p><h4>4:2e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:2e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and encourage</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Encourage/urge <span data-bnType=\"implied\">them</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to continue doing what is right/good</span>.</p></li><li><p>Encourage <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the people</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who are doing what is right/good to continue</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>encourage:</strong> Paul also told Timothy to <em>encourage</em> those people who knew the truth and who lived in ways that pleased God.

The implied information is “people should accept and live according to sound doctrine.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but:</strong> The Greek conjunction <em>alla</em>, which the BSB translates as <em>but</em>, indicates a strong contrast. People should accept sound doctrine and live according that true understanding of God’s word, <u>but instead</u>, they follow their own desires.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with itching ears:</strong> The phrase <em>itching ears</em> is a figurative way of saying that people will have a curiosity to hear something sensational or exciting, even if it is not true. They want to hear what sounds good to them. They do not want to hear anyone who criticizes them for sinning.</p><h4>4:3c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they will gather around themselves teachers:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>gather around</em> also means “to accumulate” or “to collect.” The NLT translates this simply as “They…will look for teachers….”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The people to whom Paul refers are those who will not want to listen to the true doctrine. Instead, they will choose to listen to many different religious teachers who will come to them with new, false ideas about Jesus or how to behave as a Christian.

If your language can make such strong contrasts, you should do so here. For example, you could say: “But as for you….”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>be sober in all things:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>be sober in all things</em> is a figure of speech that means that Timothy is to keep control of himself.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This word closely follows Paul’s warning that people would reject the truth of the word of God. It may mean that Paul was reminding Timothy that he should be self-controlled regarding any new teaching that might sound believable but was untrue. Timothy was to think clearly and not believe such false teaching. However, Paul also uses this word in a more general sense, indicating that Timothy should be self-controlled in every aspect of his ministry.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in all things:</strong> Other ways to translate the phrase <em>in all things</em> would be “in all situations,” “at all times” or “whatever happens.”</p><h4>4:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>endure hardship,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>endure suffering,</p></li><li><p>Be patient when you suffer.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>endure hardship:</strong> This is a theme in this letter. Paul was certain that enduring suffering was a necessary part of life for anyone who serves the Lord.

In other words, he would have to tell them the good news that Jesus had been punished for their sins when he died and rose again.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>evangelist:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>evangelist</em> is found only here and in Acts 21:8 and Ephesians 4:11. Literally it means “messenger of good (news).” See evangelist in the Glossary.</p><h4>4:5d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:5d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>fulfill your ministry.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and perform/fulfill all your responsibilities.</p></li><li><p>Do all the work that God gives you to do.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>fulfill your ministry:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>fulfill</em> also means “to discharge” or “to perform.” In addition to Timothy’s responsibilities as an evangelist, he also had responsibilities as a teacher and preacher of the word of God. Paul had instructed him to direct or oversee what people said and taught when the believers gathered as a group to worship God. He was to be careful not to allow anyone to teach false doctrines, or to discuss or argue about unimportant details. Because of the way in which Paul instructed and commanded Timothy, we know that Paul was telling him to oversee all that happened in the church at Ephesus.</p>",

The pronoun emphasizes Paul’s situation compared to Timothy’s.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek conjunction <em>gar</em>, “for,” indicates that 4:6 gives the reason why Paul had given Timothy the commands in 4:5. Timothy needed to “fulfill” his “ministry” because Paul would not be alive much longer to help him.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>being poured out like a drink offering:</strong> The phrase <em>being poured out like a drink offering</em> is the BSB translation of one Greek verb. This verb is found only here and in Philippians 2:17. It literally means “being poured out” and describes one particular type or part of a Jewish sacrifice.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Exodus 29:38–41 describes the ritual for offering sacrifices to God each morning and evening. The sacrifice included a lamb, an offering of grain mixed with oil, and a specific quantity of wine, which a priest “poured out” or “poured over” the other things. The wine that the priest poured out was called the “drink offering.” It was the final part of the entire sacrifice.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In this verse, Paul used the word meaning “being poured out” in a figurative sense. Paul considered his entire life to be a sacrifice to God. This part of his life was the final part of that sacrifice, just as the drink offering was the final part of an animal sacrifice. In other words, Paul was saying that he would die soon.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">When translating this phrase, you have several possibilities:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use the figure of speech, but add a phrase to “being poured out” so that the meaning will be easier to understand. The BSB and most other English versions do this.

These phrases emphasize Paul’s perseverance.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The clauses are short and parallel in form. This makes them easy to remember and recite. If it is possible in your language, use a similar structure in each of these clauses.</p><h4>4:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I have fought the good fight,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I have fought well <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the contest</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I have worked hard for Christ as if</span> I have fought a fight <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of faith</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I have fought the good fight:</strong> Scholars have different opinions about the meaning of the Greek here.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means a <u>fight</u>. For example, the BSB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have fought the good fight. <em>See NIV, RSV, NASB, KJV, GW, NLT, CEV, JBP, and NCV.</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means a <u>race</u>. For example, GNT says,</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have done my best in the race. <em>See also REB.</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>fought…fight:</strong> The Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>fought</em> and <em>fight</em> may refer to either athletic contests such as wrestling and boxing or to warfare. But here it is more likely that Paul was using a figure of speech that describes a fight in an athletic contest.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the good fight:</strong> A “good fight” is a metaphor. Paul meant that even though he had faced many difficulties while serving God, nevertheless he had always served God as well as he knew how to serve him. He had worked as hard as he could work. He had never quit.</p><h4>4:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I have finished the race,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I have finished <span data-bnType=\"implied\">running</span> the race,</p></li><li><p>I have completed the work <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that Christ Jesus gave me to do</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I have finished the race:</strong> This is a second figure of speech from sports. <em>I have finished the race</em> refers to completing a job by being committed and continuing to do the job even when it becomes difficult. It does not refer to finishing a job because one is strong and skillful. Paul referred to the way he had persevered in serving other people and Christ himself, because the Lord Jesus had called him to do that. When Paul wrote this, he knew that soon he would not be able to serve Jesus in this world because the Romans had sentenced him to die.</p><h4>4:7c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:7c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I have kept the faith.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I have kept/preserved the gospel/faith.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I have kept the faith:</strong> In this clause, <em>the faith</em> means the basic teachings that Christians believe. See faith in the Glossary, Meaning 2.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek verb that the BSB translated <em>have kept</em> has several meanings. Here it means, “to hold (something) firmly” or “to not lose (something).”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Part of Paul’s duty as an apostle was to make sure that the basic teachings of the faith were not “lost” or changed by the false teachers or other people who opposed the gospel. Throughout his ministry, Paul did not allow the true message to be changed to make it seem more acceptable to his hearers.</p>",

This reward is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a victory crown</span> for me because I have pleased and obeyed him/God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>From now on there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness:</strong> Here Paul used another figure of speech from sports. During the time that Paul lived, an athlete who won a fight or a race or any other sports event received a crown made of leaves as a prize. Paul lived a righteous life and had done everything that God had told him to do, so he anticipated that God would give him a prize in heaven. Paul described his prize as a crown that was already in heaven waiting for him to arrive.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>From now on:</strong> The crown was already in heaven waiting for Paul when he wrote this letter to Timothy.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the crown of righteousness:</strong> The Greek word that is translated by the BSB as <em>crown</em> is the same word that is used in 2:5b–c. It refers to the crown of leaves given to a winning athlete, not to the crown a king wears. It may be better to translate it as “reward” or “prize” instead of <em>crown</em> if your readers would not know this meaning. For example, the GNT says,</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And now there is waiting for me the victory prize….</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Scholars have several opinions about the meaning of the phrase <em>crown of righteousness</em>. Two possibilities are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is the reward or prize for a person who is righteous. In other words, it is the reward for a person who lives to please and obey God and who lives a life that God considers right. For example, the CEV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a crown will be given to me for pleasing the Lord.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is the symbol that God has accepted someone and he is right in God’s eyes. For example, GW says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The prize that shows I have God’s approval <em>See also GNT, NCV.</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions translate the phrase <em>crown of righteousness</em> literally and the reader cannot tell which option the version followed. It is recommended that if possible, you also do not specify which option you are following, However, if you need to be specific, it is recommended that you follow option (1). In the context, the crown is a reward, which fits better with option (1). See righteousness in the Glossary, Meaning 1.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this term are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>crown of victory for living right</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>victory prize for pleasing God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>reward because I was righteous</p></blockquote><h4>4:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>which the Lord, the righteous Judge,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ</span> who judges all people fairly/justly</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Lord:</strong> In this context Bible scholars agree that <em>the Lord</em> refers to Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the righteous Judge:</strong> Christ is <em>the righteous Judge</em>. He always judges people justly and fairly. The <em>righteous Judge</em> would give Paul this prize because Paul had lived righteously. See also righteous in the Glossary, Meaning 2.</p><h4>4:8c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:8c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>will award to me on that day—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>will reward me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with the crown</span> on that day <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of judgment</span>.</p></li><li><p>will give <span data-bnType=\"implied\">this crown</span> to me on the day/time <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when he judges us<sup>(incl)</sup></span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will award to me on that day:</strong> The phrase <em>on that day</em> refers to the time when Christ will return to the earth and will judge all people. A similar phrase, <em>for that day</em> occurs in 1:12d.</p><h4>4:8d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:8d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and not only to me,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The Lord will give a reward</span> not only to me,</p></li><li><p>And I am not the only person <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to whom he will give a reward</span>.</p></li></ul></div><h4>4:8e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:8e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but to all who crave His appearing.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he will</span> also <span data-bnType=\"implied\">reward</span> everyone who very much wants/waits to see him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">return to earth</span>.</p></li><li><p>Everyone who yearns to see him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">return</span> will also receive that reward.</p></li></ul></div><h4>4:8d–e</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and not only to me, but to all who:</strong> This grammatical construction (<u><em>not only</em></u> <em>me, </em><u><em>but</em></u> <em>to all who</em>…) is stronger than a simple coordination of two groups (“me <u>and</u> all who…”). These words emphasize that Paul was including other Christians.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>all who crave His appearing:</strong> Christ will also give a crown of righteousness to everyone who desires to see him. The constant, hopeful anticipation of the time when Christ will return is one of the main characteristics that distinguishes genuine Christians from other people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>crave:</strong> The word which the BSB translates as <em>crave</em> means “desire.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His appearing:</strong> The term <em>His appearing</em> refers to the time when “Christ will return.”</p>",

(See Philemon 24 and Colossians 4:14.) Demas had been in Rome again during this second time Paul was in jail, but he had left without Paul’s approval.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in his love of this world:</strong> This means that Demas preferred to enjoy what he thought were the good things in this world. It also included the customs and practices that people did to please themselves at that time. Paul used the expression <em>this world</em> in 1 Timothy 6:17 with the same meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Although Paul was disappointed that Demas abandoned him, he did not say that Demas was no longer a believer.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica:</strong> <em>Thessalonica</em> is the name of a town that was in the Roman province of Macedonia.

In winter, a trip across the sea in a ship was dangerous because of storms. If Timothy did not travel to Rome soon after he received Paul’s letter, he might have to wait another five or six months until there was good sailing weather again.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If there is no cold season in your area, you could translate <em>winter</em> as “the time when there are many storms.”</p><h4>4:21b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:21b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Eubulus sends you greetings, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Eubulus greets you, and Pudens, Linus, and Claudia also greet you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Eubulus sends you greetings, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia:</strong> The people that Paul named in this list were in Rome and knew that Paul was sending a letter to Timothy.

It refers to God being kind and favorable toward people. Therefore avoid using a long phrase to describe grace in this context.
