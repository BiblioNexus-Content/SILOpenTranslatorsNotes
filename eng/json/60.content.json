First, he wrote his name, “Peter.” Then he added a description of himself: “an apostle of Jesus Christ.” Next, he identified the people to whom he was writing. He was writing to the Christians living in five areas of Asia Minor, and he included a description of these Christians in 1:2a–d. Finally, Peter gave them a Christian greeting or blessing in 1:2e.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is more common for a writer to begin a letter by mentioning the people who will receive it before he mentions his own name. If it is not polite in your language to put the author’s name first, it may be necessary to reorder the information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>To God’s elect from Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ: I write to you who are strangers….</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This letter is for those who have been chosen by God and who are living as strangers in the world, who are scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia. It is I, Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, who am writing to you.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">However, try to find a polite way in your language to maintain the original order, if possible.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other possible headings for the section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Greetings from Peter (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Peter began his letter to scattered believers/Christians</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">From</span> Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ.</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I,</span> Peter, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">am writing this letter</span>. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am</span> an apostle of Jesus Christ.</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">This letter is from me,</span> Peter, a leader <span data-bnType=\"implied\">whom</span> Jesus Christ has sent <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to do his work</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Peter:</strong> The author began his letter by giving his name. In some languages it may be more natural to use a statement here, such as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I,</span> Peter, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">am writing this letter</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>an apostle of Jesus Christ:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>apostle</em> is literally “sent one.” It refers to a person who is sent by someone to accomplish a purpose. An apostle has authority from the one who sent him. <em>Jesus Christ</em> chose apostles and gave them authority. After he returned to heaven, his apostles were the leaders for those who believed in him. Peter was one of those apostles.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you have already translated the Gospels, you may want to use the same word for <em>apostle</em> as you used there. Some ways to translate <em>an apostle of Jesus Christ</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>one whom Jesus Christ sent <span data-bnType=\"implied\">on a mission</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a person with authority from Jesus Christ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to do his work</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a chief leader in Jesus Christ’s work</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ:</strong> The word <em>Christ</em> is used in two ways in the New Testament:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is used as a name (that is, “Jesus Christ” or “Christ”).</p></li><li><p>It is used as a title that means “the anointed one” (that is, “the Messiah” or “the Christ”).</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">In this letter, Peter used <em>Christ</em> as a name. Often it occurs with Jesus, as it does in this verse, <em>Jesus Christ</em>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In some other verses in this letter, Peter used “Christ” alone, as a name (see 1:11, 1:19, 2:21, 3:15–18, 4:1, 4:13–14, 5:1, 5:10, and 5:14).</span></span></p><h4>1:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>To the elect</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>To <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span>, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who are among</span> God’s chosen <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span>,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I greet you, who are people whom</span> God has selected <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as his own</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the elect:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the elect</em> means “God’s chosen ones,” that is, “(people) whom God chose.” God chose them and all other people who believe in Jesus to be his special people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This idea is also found in Mark 13:20 and 2 Timothy 2:10.</span></span> Some possible ways to translate <em>the elect</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s chosen <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the people</span> whom God has chosen <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be his own special people</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In this context Peter was writing to <em>the elect</em> in certain provinces. He did not mean that those people were the only people whom God had chosen. The Greek text indicates this by connecting the ideas of being strangers and being scattered. In some languages it may be necessary to indicate it in the first clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who are among</span> God’s chosen people</p></blockquote><h4>1:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who are exiles</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>foreigners in this world</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">and who are</span> living for a while as visitors <span data-bnType=\"implied\">among other people</span></p></li></ul></div><h4>1:1c–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>exiles of the Dispersion:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>exiles</em> refers to people who are living in a foreign country rather than in their own native country. This may be a simple geographic reference by which Peter is identifying the recipients of his letter. However, there could also be a sense here that the true home of believers in Jesus is heaven, not this world. Some translations bring out that sense.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>living as foreigners (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>temporary residents in the world (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>1:1d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>of the Dispersion throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, chosen</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>dispersed throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. You were chosen</p></li><li><p>in various places in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the lands of</span> Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> chose you,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>of the Dispersion:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB literally translates as <em>of the Dispersion</em> is the noun form of the verb “disperse,” which means “cause to go in different directions” or “scatter.” In Peter’s time, Jewish people who did not live in their own land of Israel referred to themselves in this way. Peter is using the term to refer to Christians, both Jews and Gentiles, to identify them as living in or near the Jewish communities that were outside of Israel but perhaps also to suggest that they are not currently living in their true land, which is heaven.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">. Some ways to translate this word include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>dispersed</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>living in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">various places</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia:</strong> These were the names of different provinces or areas where the Christians to whom Peter was writing lived. They were all located in the western part of the modern country of Turkey.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>chosen:</strong> The BSB has supplied the word <em>chosen</em>, which has the same meaning as “elect” in 1:1b. The BSB did this to show the connection between the ideas in verses 1 and 2. In Greek the ideas in 1:2a explain more about the “elect” in 1:1b. Be sure to make this connection clear in your language. Some ways to do this are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Mention the idea again in 1:2, as the NIV does:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1b</sup>To God’s elect…<sup>2a</sup>who have been chosen</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Wait until 1:2 to mention the idea “chosen,” as the RSV does:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1b</sup>To the exiles…<sup>2a</sup>chosen</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Reorder 1:1 (see the General Comment on 1:1b–d below):</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…who are chosen by God</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a natural connection in your language. In some languages it may also be more natural to express the idea as an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> chose you</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:1b–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to reorder 1b–c. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am writing</span> to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you people</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who are</span> <sup>1d</sup>located in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the provinces of</span> Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, <sup>1c</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">and who are only</span> temporary residents of this world. <sup>1b</sup>God has chosen <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1c</sup>to those living as foreigners/sojourners <sup>1d</sup>in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, <sup>1b</sup>who are chosen by God.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Such a reordering may also help you to make a natural connection with the next verse.</p></div>",

The Notes on 1:2a–e discuss the ideas and connections in detail. Here is a summary:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>God the Father chose the believers to whom Peter was writing (and all who believe in Jesus) to be his own people.</p></li><li><p>God knew the believers before he chose them, and his choice agreed with that knowledge.</p></li><li><p>God chose the believers by the work of his Spirit to make them holy as his own people.</p></li><li><p>God chose them so that they would obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with his blood.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that (c) expresses the means by which God chose the believers and (d) expresses the purpose for which he chose them.</p><h4>1:2a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>according to the foreknowledge of God the Father</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>in agreement with God the Father’s prior knowledge <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of you</span>,</p></li><li><p>and God the Father knew you long ago,</p></li><li><p>just as he, the Father, had already known you long before.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>according to the foreknowledge of God the Father:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>according to</em> means “in agreement with.” God knew the believers before he chose them, and his choice was consistent with what he already knew of them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is necessary to change the order of choosing and knowing. For example, the GW says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God the Father knew you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">long ago</span> and chose you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the foreknowledge of God the Father:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>foreknowledge</em> indicates that what God planned in the past, God makes sure will happen according to his plan. The word does not indicate when in the past God made his plan.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Ephesians 1:4 indicates that God chose believers before he created the world. This fact implies that God knew people even before he created them.</span></span> In some languages it may be necessary to include a general expression like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>much earlier</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>long ago (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase may be expressed in several ways:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God planned long ago to choose you (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God the Father chose you long ago according to his plan</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God the Father purposed long ago to choose you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If your language uses passive verbs, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It was God the Father’s purpose long ago to choose you</p></blockquote><h4>1:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and sanctified by the Spirit</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>by/through the work the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Holy</span> Spirit did to dedicate/indicate you as holy <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for him/God</span>,</p></li><li><p>by the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Holy</span> Spirit setting you apart <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for him/God</span></p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He chose you</span> through what the Holy Spirit did to sanctify/consecrate you to God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and sanctified by the Spirit:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>and</em> is literally “in” or “by.” There are several ways to understand the way that this part of the verse relates to 1:1b–1:2a:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The sanctifying work of the Spirit was <u>the means by which</u> God chose Peter’s readers to be his own people. For example, the NASB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>[chosen…] by the sanctifying work of the Spirit <em>(NIV, KJV, NCV, REB, NASB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The sanctifying work of the Spirit was <u>another thing</u> that God did for Peter’s readers. For example, the GNT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>[You were chosen…] and were made a holy people by his Spirit <em>(BSB, RSV, CEV, NLT, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The sanctifying work of the Spirit was <u>the purpose for which</u> God chose Peter’s readers. For example, the NJB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>[chosen] to be made holy by the Spirit <em>(GW, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you choose interpretation (1). God’s Spirit sanctified (set apart) the people for God as his own. This was the way that God chose them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sanctified by the Spirit:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>sanctified by the Spirit</em> means that God’s Holy Spirit had sanctified Peter’s readers. To “sanctify” something is to set it apart as holy and belonging to God. In this context the Spirit had made Peter’s readers holy and had set them apart for God. Now they belonged to God alone. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>being set apart by the Spirit (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the consecrating work of the Spirit (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Spirit has made you holy (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Spirit setting you apart <span data-bnType=\"implied\">only for God</span></p></blockquote><h4>1:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for obedience to Jesus Christ</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">in order</span> that you would become obedient to Jesus Christ</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God did this</span> so that you would do what Jesus Christ said</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He/God chose you, because he desired/wanted you</span> to obey Jesus Christ</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for obedience to Jesus Christ:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>for</em> introduces two purposes for which God chose the believers (1:2c and 1:2d). The first purpose was that they would obey Jesus Christ.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Though it is not explicit in the Greek text that God chose Peter’s readers to be obedient to Jesus Christ, many translations make this explicit (BSB, CEV, GW, JBP, NASB, NIV, NJB, NLT, NRSV, REB, RSV, GNT). The NCV specifies that the obedience is to God: “God wanted you to obey him.” The KJV and the NET do not make explicit who is to be obeyed.</span></span> In this context Peter probably implied a special way in which they had obeyed. They had obeyed Jesus Christ by believing in him and recognizing him as their Lord whom they would continue to obey forever. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to be obedient to Jesus Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in order that you would obey Jesus Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because he/God wanted you to obey Jesus Christ</p></blockquote><h4>1:2d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and sprinkling by His blood:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in order that you would be</span> sprinkled with his/<span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus’</span> blood.</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so that</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus’</span> blood would be sprinkled on you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to purify you</span>.</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he wanted to cause</span> the blood <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from Jesus’ death</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to clean you</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>sprinkling by His blood:</strong> This phrase is a figure of speech that tells the second purpose for which God chose the believers. Jesus’ <em>blood</em> symbolizes his death. The action of <em>sprinkling</em> the <em>blood</em> symbolizes that God purifies believers from their sins because Jesus died for them. It does not imply that Jesus’ literal blood would be sprinkled on them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The symbol of sprinkling a person with blood was used in the Old Testament. In Exodus 24:3–8, Moses sprinkled the blood of bulls on the people of Israel in order to symbolize that God was purifying them.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>An alternative way to understand the metaphor is as a figure of speech illustrating the sealing of the covenant. See the footnote in the CEV, which says: According to Exodus 24:3–8, the people of Israel were sprinkled with the blood of cows to show they would keep their agreement with God. Peter says that it is the blood of Jesus that seals the agreement between God and his people. However, this understanding is not reflected in the texts of any of the main English versions.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are possible ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate both the figure of speech and its meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God would declare you not guilty of your sins</span> because of Jesus Christ’s <span data-bnType=\"implied\">death, as though his</span> blood was sprinkled on you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to be sprinkled by his blood <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that purifies you from your sins</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>[to] be purified by his blood. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> might use the blood/death of Jesus Christ to make/declare you pure/not guilty</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the figure of speech and include a footnote to explain the meaning. An example of a possible footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jesus’ blood symbolized his death for people. In the Old Testament, Moses sprinkled the Israelites with blood from bulls sacrificed to God. This was a symbol that God was purifying them. See Exodus 24:3–8 and Leviticus 14:6–7. Now God purifies believers from their sins and declares them forgiven because Jesus died for them.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His blood:</strong> The <em>blood</em> of Jesus Christ refers to blood that he shed when he died. You may need to make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the blood of his <span data-bnType=\"implied\">death</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his <span data-bnType=\"implied\">life</span> blood</p></blockquote><h4>1:2e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Grace and peace be yours in abundance.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">May God show</span> you much grace and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">give</span> you much peace.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">May God</span> greatly favour you and fill you with peaceful contentment.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I pray that God will</span> be very good to you and increase your peace more and more.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Grace and peace be yours in abundance:</strong> During the time that Peter wrote this letter, Christians often greeted each other by saying “Grace and peace to you.” It was a sort of blessing. Here Peter expressed his desire for God to bless his readers. If you have a similar form of greeting or blessing in your language, you may be able to use it here. Refer to your translation of the similar phrases in Romans 1:7; 1 Corinthians 1:3; and Philippians 1:2.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions indicate that God is the source/giver of the <em>Grace and peace</em> (CEV, NLT). You may do this if it sounds natural in your language and culture. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May you know more and more of God’s grace and peace (JBP)</p></blockquote><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>In some languages it may be necessary to use different phrases to express the ideas of <em>Grace</em> and <em>peace</em>. Notice the two phrases connected by “and” in the examples below:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">May God show</span> you much grace and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">give</span> you much peace.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">May God</span> favor you and calm your hearts/minds more and more.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>in abundance</em> is literally “be multiplied.” To have grace and peace <em>in abundance</em> means “to have much grace and peace,” “to experience grace and peace greatly or increasingly.” In some languages, there may be an idiom to express this idea. Some ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May you receive <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> <u>special</u> favor and live in <u>increasing</u> peace.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May God favor you <u>more and more</u> and make you <u>supremely</u> content.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Grace:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Grace</em> refers to kindness that is shown to people freely, not because they have done anything to deserve it. The Christians added the word <em>Grace</em> to the common Jewish greeting of “peace.” In this context, the word refers to God’s grace. He is good to people because he loves them.

It was common for the Jews to use a phrase like this as a formal way to affirm that God is worthy to be praised. It indicates that people should praise God by telling others how wonderful and excellent he is. Some other ways to translate this meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Let us give thanks to… (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>All honor to… (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Praise… (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means that God is both the <u>God</u> of our Lord Jesus Christ and the <u>Father</u> of our Lord Jesus Christ. For example, TLB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God, the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ <em>(BSB, GW, KJV, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, REB, RSV, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means that God is the <u>Father</u> of our Lord Jesus Christ. For example, the CEV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ <em>(NJB, CEV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), as the majority of English versions do.</p><h4>1:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>By His great mercy He has given us new birth</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Because he is so merciful, he has caused us<sup>(incl)</sup> to be born again.</p></li><li><p>He has given us<sup>(incl)</sup> new life/birth because his compassion is so great!</p></li><li><p>He is very compassionate, and so he has caused us<sup>(incl)</sup> to live new lives</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>By His great mercy:</strong> The phrase <em>By His great mercy</em> here means “because of God’s great mercy.” God’s <em>great mercy</em> is the <u>reason</u> why God provided a new birth (1:3b). The GW says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God has given us a new birth <u>because</u> of his great mercy.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>His great mercy</em> refers here to the generous compassion that God has for people. He showed great mercy to those who believe in his Son, Jesus Christ. Although they had sinned, he did not punish them but forgave them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to express <em>His great mercy</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because he is so merciful</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> is very compassionate</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He has given us new birth:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>has given us new birth</em> is literally “having caused us to be born again.” This is a figure of speech. It expresses the great change that God made in the lives of Peter and his readers when they believed in Jesus. God made them like new people, and they began a new type of life with him.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Goppelt says that “new birth occurs as transposition into a new life situation, namely as the dawn of an…unfailing and effective ‘living hope’” (page 83). In other words, God caused them to be born into (enter into, begin) a new life.</span></span> They had a new hope and a new inheritance in heaven (1:3–4).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>us:</strong> In this letter, the terms <em>us</em> and “we” always include Peter’s readers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>new birth:</strong> The phrase <em>new birth</em> does not mean that the believers had been born again as babies. Refer to John 1:12–13, 3:3. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he has caused us to be born again (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he has given us new life (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he has made our lives new</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he has changed our lives as if we were born again</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you use <em>birth</em> or “born” in your translation, you will want to make sure that it does not sound as if Peter said that God had given them children.</p><h4>1:3c, 4a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>into a living hope</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We</span><sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">now live</span> in confident hope</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">So now</span> we<sup>(incl)</sup> expect <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his blessings</span> with certainty</p></li><li><p>of confident expectation,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>into a living hope…and into an inheritance:</strong> In Greek, 1:3c and 1:4a both begin with the word that is often translated as <em>into</em> (BSB) or “for.” Many scholars believe that both times, this word introduces a benefit (result) of the new birth that God had given the believers.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Elliott, page 333, says, “This is the first of three…<em>eis</em> (“for”) phrases…identifying three related results or benefits of God’s regenerating action.” Most English versions have “into a living hope” for the first <em>eis</em> phrase (BSB, NRSV, NJB, REB, NET, NCV, NIV). The RSV and KJV have “to” or “unto” respectively. The only real unambiguous readings indicate result (GW, NLT, CEV, GNT). For “into an inheritance,” several versions imply result: BSB, NIV, NJB, NRSV, KJV, and GW. Several indicate that the inheritance is the content of the hope, that is, what is hoped for (NCV, NET, REB, GNT). The difference in content and result in this context may be less than it appears. The new birth gives believers a living hope in an inheritance that is also the result of the new birth.</span></span> The BSB indicates this by supplying the connector <em>and</em>, which is not in the Greek text. In 1:3c, the benefit of the new birth is <em>hope</em>, and in 1:4a the benefit is an <em>inheritance</em>. Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>with the result</u> that we have a living hope…and an inheritance</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>As a result</u> we have a living hope…and an inheritance</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The benefits (blessings) of the new birth are in focus in this context.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a living hope:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>a living hope</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to a hope that would certainly be fulfilled. People could have confidence that they would not be disappointed in that hope. The EASY translation says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as we live, we are sure that we will receive good things from God</p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to “a hope that continues.” People keep hoping year after year without stopping.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This interpretation is supported by the UBS Handbook, Selwyn, page 124 (“a hope that is never extinguished by untoward circumstances”), Bigg (“hope is…eternal”), and Grudem, page 55 (“it grows and increases in strength year by year”).</span></span> The CEV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a hope that lives on (CEV)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions are ambiguous, and both ideas are true. However, if you must choose between these interpretations, it is recommended that you choose interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>hope:</strong> In the New Testament, a <em>hope</em> is the confident expectation that something good will happen. In some languages it may be necessary to translate it with a verb phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we have assurance/certainty</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we confidently expect</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is necessary to translate <em>hope</em> as an action. In some of those languages, it is also necessary to specify what is hoped for. If that is true in your language, you may want to specify that the believers hoped for the inheritance. For example, the REB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>hope, the hope of an inheritance (REB)</p></blockquote><h4>1:3d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:3d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>by means of Jesus Christ rising from death.</p></li><li><p>through Jesus Christ living again after his death.</p></li><li><p>because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he caused</span> Jesus Christ to live again after he died.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead:</strong> The phrase <em>through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead</em> indicates that Jesus’ resurrection is the means by which God gave Peter and his readers a new birth into a living hope and an inheritance. For example, the GNT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>by raising Jesus Christ from death (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead:</strong> This context implies that God caused Jesus Christ to live again after his death. In some languages, it may be necessary to make that explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God gave us this new birth/life</span> by causing Jesus to live again after his death</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>resurrection:</strong> The term <em>resurrection</em> refers to someone’s body becoming alive again after his death. It does not refer only to his soul or spirit becoming alive again.

They describe various ways in which things may become worthless. In this context they indicate that the spiritual inheritance of believers will last forever.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>is imperishable:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB literally translates as <em>imperishable</em> describes something that does not decay, die, or end. Other ways to say this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will never decay</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will never rot</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will always remain fresh/new</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will never diminish in value</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>undefiled:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB literally translates as <em>undefiled</em> means that nothing can ever mar or pollute the inheritance.

Other ways to say this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>cannot be spoiled (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will always remain pure</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>unfading:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB literally translates as <em>unfading</em> means that the inheritance will never fade. To “fade” is to lose brightness or beauty. The inheritance that God gives believers will never lose its brightness or beauty. In this context this word has a figurative meaning, since many of the blessings of the inheritance cannot be seen. These blessings are <em>unfading</em> in the sense that they are permanent.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>God in his strength</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the powerful God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>Almighty God</p></blockquote><h4>1:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for the salvation</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He is shielding you</span> until it is time for the salvation</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He/God will continue to protect you</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as you</span> wait <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for him</span> to completely save <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span></p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He/God will keep you safe</span> until he delivers you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from all evil</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>for</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It introduces the time during which God was protecting them. He would continue to protect them <em>until</em> the time when the final salvation is revealed. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>until salvation is shown to you at the end of time (NCV) <em>(NIV, NJB, NLT, REB, NCV, CEV JBP)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It introduces the purpose for which God was protecting them. God was protecting them in order to save them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time (RSV) <em>(BSB, GW, KJV, NASB, NET, GNT, RSV)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Elliott, page 337, Michaels, page 23, “no longer simply to protect his people.”</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This part of the verse begins with the Greek word <em>eis</em> (“into, for, until”).

Each of those benefits begin with <em>eis</em>: a living hope (1:3) an inheritance (1:4) salvation (1:5)(b) It is also (and mainly) connected with “shielded” in 1:5a.In many languages it may not be possible to express both of these connections in your translation. If you must choose, it is most important to express the connection with “shielded.” See Beare (page 84).</span></span> The Greek word does not imply that God would stop protecting his people when the salvation came, but they might not need the same type of protection.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the salvation:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB literally translates as <em>the salvation</em> refers to being rescued or saved from something harmful or dangerous. A person may be saved from physical dangers such as death or enemies or from spiritual dangers such as sin and its punishment. In this context <em>salvation</em> refers to being saved in the future in heaven. At that time God will deliver believers from all sin and suffering. Then they will have the joyful, eternal life that includes the blessings of the inheritance (1:4). In some languages, it may be necessary to translate <em>salvation</em> as a verb or phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are saved</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are rescued</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God saves/rescues you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God delivers you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from all evil</span></p></blockquote><h4>1:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that is ready to be revealed in the last time.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he has</span> prepared to reveal <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when the time is right</span> in the last days.</p></li><li><p>in the way that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he</span> will make known at the end of time.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He</span> is ready to cause <span data-bnType=\"implied\">everyone</span> to see/know this in the final days <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of this world</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that is ready to be revealed:</strong> This is a passive clause.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has prepared to reveal <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to people</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has made ready to show <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>revealed:</strong> In some languages it may not be possible to “reveal” or show something that is not a physical object. If that is true in your language, you may need to use a different expression. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will <u>cause</u> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">everyone</span> to <u>know</u> about</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the last time:</strong> The Greek word which the BSB translates as <em>time</em> refers to a time that has a special purpose. The word does not indicate how long that period of time lasts. In this context <em>in the last time</em> refers to the time at the end of this age/world. At that time God’s salvation will be revealed. Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>at the end of time (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>at the final point of time (NJB)</p></blockquote>",

He also praised God for the good things that God has made ready for his people in heaven (1:3–5). These blessings from God cause believers to rejoice, even in times of trouble. They have joy because they know that God is saving their souls (1:6–9).

They had foretold that Christ would suffer in order to save people (1:10–12).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The hope of eternal life (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Faith in Christ brings you joy (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A real reason for hope (CEV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:6</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">The two parts of this verse contrast with each other. The believers greatly rejoiced in what God had done for them, even while they were enduring various kinds of troubles. The BSB and many other English versions supply a word like “though” to connect these ideas (1:6a and 1:6b). Consider the best way to connect them in your language, while also keeping the connection between verses 5 and 6.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be necessary to use two sentences.

It may be more natural in your language to use a plural form. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You are extremely happy about these things (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>greatly rejoice:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>greatly rejoice</em> means “be very happy.” Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>extremely happy (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>truly glad (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>are very glad</p></blockquote><h4>1:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>even though now, for a short time, you must suffer</p></li><li><p>even though you must now endure, for a short time,</p></li><li><p>It is true that now it is necessary that you endure for a little while</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>though:</strong> The BSB has supplied the word <em>though</em> here to indicate contrast. See the note on 1:6 above. The believers had to suffer, but even so, they rejoiced. Some other ways to introduce this contrast is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>even though</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>although</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in spite of</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a natural way in your language to introduce such a contrast.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is a concession-contraexpectation relationship between these clauses. However, the concessive clause (“though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials”) comes after the contraexpectation (“…you greatly rejoice”).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>now:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>now</em> is a time word. It refers to the time when Peter was writing. It contrasts with the <u>future</u> time of salvation in 1:5. Some other ways this may be translated are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>presently</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>at this time</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for a little while:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>for a little while</em> refers here to a brief time. In this context it means that Peter’s readers would only have to suffer for a short time. The Lord would soon deliver them. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for a short time (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you may have had to suffer grief:</strong>There are two ways to interpret Peter’s statement concerning <em>to suffer grief</em> in this context:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Peter spoke of his readers’ suffering <u>as a fact</u>. He implied that his readers were already suffering.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This interpretation is supported by the following commentaries: Kistemaker, page 46; Achtemeier, page 101; Michaels, page 28; and Kelly, page 53.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>even though</u> for a short time yet you must bear all sorts of trials (NJB) <em>(NLT, GW, NJB, NRSV, KJV; probably NIV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Peter spoke of his readers’ suffering <u>as a possibility</u>. He implied that it was possible that his readers might have to suffer or might have suffered.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This interpretation is supported by the following commentaries: Beare, page 86; Best, pages 77–78; Marshall, page 40.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>even if</u> you have to go through many hard trials (CEV) <em>(BSB, NCV, NET, RSV, GNT, CEV; possibly NASB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), which agrees with most commentators.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>you may have had to suffer grief</em> is more literally “if necessary, you having been grieved.” This grieving from suffering had begun in the past, had continued in the present (“now”), and would continue for a little while in the future. So you should use an expression that would be as general as possible with regard to time.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>suffer grief:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>suffer grief</em> is literally “be grieved.” It refers to the grief, sadness or emotional pain that people feel when they have trouble. This is a passive verb, and it may be natural for some languages to translate it that way. For example, the ESV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you have been grieved (ESV)</p></blockquote><h4>1:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in various trials</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because of different kinds of trials.</p></li><li><p>different kinds of trouble.</p></li><li><p>various troubles that cause you grief.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in various trials:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB literally translates as <em>various trials</em> refers to the difficulties the people have been experiencing. Languages have different ways to express the experience of bearing such trials. Some ways to say this in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to be sad…because of the many kinds of trials you suffer (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to endure many trials (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>must bear all sorts of trials (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>trials:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>trials</em> refers to the various problems and difficulties Peter’s readers were experiencing. These <em>trials</em> included troubles that came from other people who were persecuting them because they believed in Jesus Christ.

He told his readers that the people who continue to trust in Jesus Christ when they are tested by troubles will receive praise, glory, and honor when Jesus returns to this earth.

(NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Their purpose is to prove… (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>These trials will show that… (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God allows these difficulties to happen…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the proven character of your faith:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>proven character</em> indicates that something has been tested and that the test has shown that it is real, pure, or sincere. In this context it probably refers to the proven sincerity of the readers’ faith in God. Their trials had tested their faith and shown it to be genuine. Some other ways to translate this expression are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>will show that your faith is genuine (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>show the proven character of your faith (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>prove that your faith is pure (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your faith:</strong> The word <em>faith</em> refers here to the action of trusting someone and believing in him. In this context Peter is speaking of having steadfast loyalty to God/Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to translate <em>faith</em> as a verb and to supply the object. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>trust <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God/Christ</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in God/Christ</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to translate <em>proven character</em> and <em>faith</em> as one or more verb phrases.

It is temporary and will someday be destroyed. This is in contrast to genuine faith, which will last even after Jesus Christ is revealed. Some other ways to translate <em>perishes</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that can be destroyed (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will be ruined</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that will not last for ever</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>refined by fire:</strong> People used a very hot <em>fire</em> to heat gold. They would melt it to test it and see if it was pure. If gold is pure, when it is melted no impurities will float to the top. Our faith is compared to gold.

These Notes do not address the issue raised by Abernathy, pages 22–23, “to whom or what is ‘praise, glory, and honor’ directed?” The author found almost no commentary support for this position, i.e. that it is directed toward God/Christ.

He will speak well of them.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will praise <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>glory:</strong> In this context the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>glory</em> is similar in meaning to “honor” or “praise.” Some other ways to say this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>make high</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will exalt <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>honor:</strong> In this context <em>honor</em> indicates that God will treat believers as valuable and worthy to be respected. Some other ways to translate this word include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>make famous</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>cause to be respected</p></blockquote><h4>1:7e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:7e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>at the revelation of Jesus Christ.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">on the day</span> when Jesus Christ appears <span data-bnType=\"implied\">again</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">at the time</span> when Jesus Christ will reveal himself <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to the whole world</span>.</p></li><li><p>when Jesus Christ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">returns and</span> reveals himself <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to all people</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>at the revelation of Jesus Christ:</strong> The phrase <em>at the revelation of Jesus Christ</em> means “when Jesus Christ is revealed.” This refers to the time when Jesus Christ will return to the world and reveal (show) himself to people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some scholars interpret “revelation” as a passive idea with God as the agent.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The purpose <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of these trials</span> is that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">your faith might be proved genuine.

There are different ways to do this. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7a</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God has allowed these trials</span> so that when your faith is proved genuine <sup>7d</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">he</span> may give <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span> praise, glory, and honor. <sup>7e</sup>This will happen on the day when Jesus Christ is revealed. <sup>7c</sup>Gold is tested by fire, even though it will perish. <sup>7b</sup>And your genuine/tested faith is more valuable than gold.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7a</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">These trials are testing your faith</span> in order to prove that it is genuine. <sup>7c</sup>In a similar way, people use fire to test gold, even though gold is perishable. <sup>7b</sup>Genuine faith is more precious than gold. <sup>7d</sup>It will bring you praise, glory, and honor <sup>7e</sup>when Christ appears <span data-bnType=\"implied\">on earth</span>.</p></blockquote></div>",

He also praised God for the good things that God has made ready for his people in heaven (1:3–5). These blessings from God cause believers to rejoice, even in times of trouble. They have joy because they know that God is saving their souls (1:6–9). In the final paragraph, Peter reminded his readers of how the Old Testament prophets had earlier prophesied about this salvation. They had foretold that Christ would suffer in order to save people (1:10–12).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The hope of eternal life (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Faith in Christ brings you joy (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A real reason for hope (CEV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:8a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:8a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Though you have not seen Him, you love Him;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Although you have not seen him, you love him;</p></li><li><p>You have never seen <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus Christ</span>, but <span data-bnType=\"implied\">nevertheless</span> you love him.</p></li><li><p>You love <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus Christ</span> without ever seeing him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Though you have not seen Him, you love Him:</strong> The Christians to whom Peter wrote this letter had not seen Jesus when he was on earth. However, they loved him. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Other ways to translate it are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You have not seen Christ, but still you love him. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You love <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus Christ</span> although you have not seen him.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Him:</strong> <em>Him</em> refers to Jesus Christ. In some languages it may be more natural to repeat his name here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You have not seen <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus Christ</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In this letter, Peter does not use the name “Jesus” without “Christ.” He also does not use only “Christ” until 1:11, where he refers to Christ before he became a human being. Therefore, if you make his name explicit here, it is best to say “Jesus Christ.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>love:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>love</em> means that a person values and reveres Jesus Christ (and God) with gratitude and affection. He is devoted and loyal to Christ. Use a natural expression or idiom for this word.</p><h4>1:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and though you do not see Him now, you believe in Him</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and even though you are not seeing him now, you trust in him.</p></li><li><p>You cannot see him now, but you trust him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and though you do not see Him now, you believe in Him:</strong> This verse part is similar in meaning to 1:8a. The believers were trusting Jesus Christ without being able to see him. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Other ways to translate it are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You do not see him now, but still you believe in him.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You believe in Jesus Christ, even though you do not see him now.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>believe in Him:</strong> To <em>believe in</em> Jesus means to “entrust oneself” to Jesus, that is, “to place oneself in the complete care” of Jesus. Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>rely/depend on</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>trust in</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>trust in and commit to</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>have confidence in</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Your language may use an idiom for this meaning.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:8a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The statements in 1:8a and 1:8b are similar. In some languages it may be helpful to translate each statement in a parallel way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You have never seen Jesus Christ, yet you love him.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You do not see him now, yet you believe in him.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to put the two negative and the two positive statements in 1:8a–b together. For example, the CEV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You have never seen Jesus, and you don’t see him now. But still you love him and have faith in him… (CEV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:8c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:8c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and rejoice with an inexpressible and glorious joy,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">As a result, you</span> are rejoicing greatly, with a joy that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span> cannot describe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because</span> it is so magnificent.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Because you trust him,</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you feel</span> a joy so wonderful <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that you</span> do not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">have words</span> to describe/express it.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>and</em> introduces what happens as a result of 1:8a–b. The NET says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and so…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>rejoice with an inexpressible and glorious joy:</strong> In Greek, this part of the verse is literally, “you rejoice with joy inexpressible and glorious.” This phrase emphasizes the great joy that the believers feel. They are so joyful that they are not able to describe it. Use a natural way to express this emphasis in your language. Here are some ways to say this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are wonderfully happy, more than you can express</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>no words can tell how glad and happy you are (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You are extremely happy with joy and praise that can hardly be expressed in words (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>inexpressible:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translate as <em>inexpressible</em> occurs only here in the New Testament. Peter meant that the joy was so great and wonderful that no one could describe it adequately in words. Other ways to say this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>indescribable (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>cannot be described (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>which words cannot express (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>glorious:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>glorious</em> is literally “having been glorified/exalted.” This is a passive verbal form. The joy was a special kind of joy that came from their faith in Jesus. If you have an expression that describes joy that comes from something wonderful or magnificent, you may be able to use it here.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>About this joy, Grudem says, “The sense of this word exalted (a perfect passive participle) could be given more fully by paraphrasing, ‘joy that has been infused with heavenly glory and that still possesses the radiance of that glory.’ It is thus joy that results from being in the presence of God himself, and joy that even now partakes of the character of heaven. It is the joy of heaven before heaven, experienced now in fellowship with the unseen Christ.” Davids says, “The joy is also “filled with glory,” a joy that has already been glorified, not in the sense that they already experience the fullness of glory of the coming of Christ, but in the sense that in their love and commitment to Christ they experience a joy that partakes of and anticipates the joy of the final day of salvation. It is in their focus on Christ, rather than on circumstances or even on doctrine, that they find this joy.”</span></span> Other ways to say this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>full of glory (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>exalted (RSV)</p></blockquote>",

This view is followed by BSB, CEV, GW, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, NRSV, REB, and GNT. However, some scholars believe that it refers exclusively to the future salvation either in heaven or when he returns. (See the NLT and NJB.)</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the goal of your faith:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>goal</em> in this context:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to the <u>goal</u> or <u>purpose</u> of the believers’ faith. They believed in Jesus in order to be saved. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the goal of your faith (GW) <em>(BSB, CEV, NCV, NET, NIV, NJB, GNT, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to the <u>result</u> of the believers’ faith.

He also praised God for the good things that God has made ready for his people in heaven (1:3–5). These blessings from God cause believers to rejoice, even in times of trouble. They have joy because they know that God is saving their souls (1:6–9). In the final paragraph, Peter reminded his readers of how the Old Testament prophets had earlier prophesied about this salvation. They had foretold that Christ would suffer in order to save people (1:10–12).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The hope of eternal life (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Faith in Christ brings you joy (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A real reason for hope (CEV)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1061001010\" data-endVerseId=\"1061001012\"><h3>Paragraph 1:10–12</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Peter told his readers that they were privileged because they had heard the gospel. Peter’s readers understood the good news about how God saves people more clearly than did the prophets who lived before them. Peter’s readers were also privileged in that as Christians they knew from experience what it is like to have God save them. Even the angels do not know this.</p></div><h4>1:11</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Long before Peter wrote this letter, the Holy Spirit revealed to the prophets of the Old Testament what would happen to the Christ, God’s Son. The Holy Spirit revealed that he would suffer and then receive glory from God his Father.</p><h4>1:11a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:11a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>trying to determine the time and setting</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>trying to discover when and under what circumstances</p></li><li><p>because they wanted to know when and how</p></li><li><p>They looked for when <span data-bnType=\"implied\">these prophecies would happen</span> and what things would be like at that time.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>trying to determine the time and setting:</strong> There are two ways of interpreting the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>time and setting</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means what <u>time</u> and what <u>circumstances</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>[The prophets] tried to learn…when those things would happen, and what the world would be like at that time. (NCV) <em>(BSB, GW, KJV, NIV, NJB, REB, GNT, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means what <u>person</u> and what <u>time</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they searched to find out exactly who Christ would be and when this would happen. (CEV) <em>(NASB, NET, NLT, RSV, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). However, since scholars are uncertain about this and either meaning is possible, you may wish to follow the major-language version in your area.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and:</strong> There are two ways of interpreting the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>and</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <em>and</em>. <em>(BSB, CEV, NCV, NIV, NJB, NLT, REB, GNT)</em></p></li><li><p>It means <u>or</u>. <em>(GW, KJV, NASB, NET, RSV)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) since in this context it is clear that the prophets were searching for <u>both</u> the time and the circumstances.</p><h4>1:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the events would happen</span> which the Spirit of Christ had directed them to say/prophesy.</p></li><li><p>Christ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">had sent</span> the Holy Spirit to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">give</span> these prophets messages, to tell <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Spirit of Christ:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the Spirit of Christ</em> refers to the Holy Spirit. It does not refer to Jesus’ human spirit, but the Holy Spirit sent from Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If your readers would understand the phrase <em>the Spirit of Christ</em> to refer to Christ’s own spirit, then you may need to say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Holy</span> Spirit <span data-bnType=\"implied\">sent by</span> Christ</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also John 16:7, where Jesus explained to his disciples that, after he went to His Father, he would send the Holy Spirit.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ:</strong> These notes and the meaning lines in the Display follow the interpretation that Peter used <em>Christ</em> as a name rather than a title (see the note on “Christ” at 1:1a).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in them:</strong> The phrase <em>in them</em> implies that the Holy Spirit was controlling the words of these prophets. The prophets were speaking, but the Holy Spirit was causing them to speak and telling them what to say. If saying that the Spirit of Christ was <em>in them</em> is unnatural in your language, or communicates a wrong meaning, you may be able to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who directed them to speak/prophesy</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who told/gave them what to write/say</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who inspired their writings</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>was pointing:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>was pointing</em> in this context means to reveal or make something known. The verb is in the imperfect tense, showing that the Spirit continued doing this again and again. The GW therefore translates this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>kept referring to (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate this verb include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>was indicating (NASB, NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>was showing (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>1:11c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:11c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>when He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He told them in advance that Christ would suffer <span data-bnType=\"implied\">much</span> and afterwards <span data-bnType=\"implied\">receive</span> glory.</p></li><li><p>ahead of time that Christ would suffer <span data-bnType=\"implied\">greatly</span> and afterwards be glorified/honoured.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>when He predicted:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>predicted</em> means to tell about something before it happens. In contrast, the English word “predict” can mean to say something about the future that does not in fact ever happen. Be sure that your translation follows the meaning of the Greek. What the Holy Spirit told the prophets was sure to happen. Other ways to say this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>told them in advance (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>foretold (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the sufferings of Christ:</strong> The phrase <em>the sufferings of Christ</em> means “how Christ would suffer.” It implies that his suffering would result in death. When the Holy Spirit told the prophets about how Christ would suffer and die, it was still in the future. Christ was not born until several hundred years later. Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>how Christ would suffer (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and the glories to follow:</strong> The phrase <em>and the glories to follow</em> means “how Christ would receive glory after he had suffered and died.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>glories:</strong> The Greek text reads <em>glories</em>, in the plural. Peter was perhaps referring to a series of events, including Christ’s resurrection and ascension into heaven. But in some languages the plural of the word “glory” may be unnatural or may not exist at all. If this is the case in your language, it may be necessary to use the singular word “glory” (as in the NLT and several other English versions). Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>glorious events</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wonderful things <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that would happen</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If your language does not normally use abstract nouns such as <em>glories</em>, then you may want to use a verb, such as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>glorified</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>honored</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If it is necessary in your language to say who would glorify Jesus Christ, then you should supply the subject “God”:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>how <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> would honor/glorify him</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also the note on “glory” at 1:7d.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:10–11</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">You may be able to make your translation of verses 10–11 clearer and more natural by reordering the verse parts. This is one suggestion:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10a</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Long ago God’s</span> prophets foretold that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> would be kind to you and save <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span>. <sup>11b</sup> Christ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">had sent</span> the Holy Spirit to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">give</span> these prophets messages to tell <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> <sup>11c</sup>ahead of time that Christ was going to suffer and afterwards be glorified/honored. <sup>10b</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The prophets</span> thoroughly researched and investigated <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the Scriptures, because they wanted</span> <sup>11a</sup>to discover when and under what circumstances <span data-bnType=\"implied\">these prophecies would be fulfilled</span>.</p></blockquote></div>",

Instead, future generations, after Jesus Christ’s ministry on earth, would benefit from knowing how God had fulfilled these prophecies through Jesus Christ. Peter wrote this letter at a time when many of these prophecies had been fulfilled and his readers had been taught to what events these prophecies referred.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>It was revealed to them:</strong> This is a passive verb that does not specify who did the action. Your language may require you to say who <em>revealed</em> this <em>to</em> the prophets. In this paragraph, Peter mentioned the Holy Spirit twice as the agent sent from heaven. Here is a way you could translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The Holy Spirit</span> revealed to them</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate it:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> revealed to them</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>revealed:</strong> In this context the Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>revealed</em> means “told” or “made known.” The prophets did not actually see their prophecies about Christ fulfilled. You may be able to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>enabled the prophets to understand</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In 1:11b, Peter wrote about the Holy Spirit communicating with the prophets. If you use a verb here in 1:12 that is similar to the verb you used in 1:11, then you may want to add “also” in 1:12. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The Holy Spirit also</span> told them</p></blockquote><h4>1:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that they were not serving themselves, but you, when they foretold the things</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>that they spoke these <span data-bnType=\"implied\">prophetic messages</span> not for their own benefit, but for yours.</p></li><li><p>that they were announcing these <span data-bnType=\"implied\">prophetic messages concerning Christ</span> so that you would understand <span data-bnType=\"implied\">how he fulfilled them</span>, not so that they could understand.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they were not serving themselves, but you:</strong> The phrase <em>they were not serving themselves, but you</em> means “the prophets were not helping/benefitting themselves but they were helping/benefitting you, my readers.” God did not give these prophecies to the prophets in order for the prophets to know exactly when they would be fulfilled. Instead, by telling the prophecies, the prophets benefitted people who lived much later, including Peter’s readers. At the time when Peter wrote this letter, his readers could know when and how God had made the prophecies concerning Jesus Christ happen. Another way to say this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>not for their own benefit, but for yours (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>they:</strong> The pronoun <em>they</em> refers to the Old Testament prophets who prophesied about Jesus Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>when they foretold:</strong> The BSB has supplied the words <em>when they foretold</em> in order to make the translation clearer and more natural English. The Greek text does not contain these words. Several other English translations contain similar phrases. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>delivering the message (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when they told (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the things:</strong> The phrase <em>the things</em> refers to the sufferings and glory of Christ mentioned in 1:11c.</p><h4>1:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>now announced by those who preached the gospel to you</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The men who preached the gospel to you told you these things</p></li><li><p>Now <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you have heard these prophecies</span>. The evangelists told them to you</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>now announced by those who preached the gospel to you:</strong> By the time Peter wrote this letter, these prophecies concerning Christ had been fulfilled. Christian teachers had <em>announced</em> these prophecies to people, including Peter’s readers, telling them how Jesus Christ had fulfilled the prophecies.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The verb <em>announced</em> is in the passive. In some languages it may be necessary to use an active verb:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that those who preached the gospel to you told you…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that the evangelists announced/declared to you….</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>now:</strong> In this verse, <em>now</em> refers to the time when Peter lived. Peter’s readers had heard the prophecies about Jesus Christ as Savior, and they had heard that these prophecies had been fulfilled.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>announced:</strong> The Greek says literally “announced to you.” The BSB omits the phrase “to you” for brevity, but it may be necessary in your language to specify to whom something was announced. If so, you can say “to you” (plural). The verb that the BSB translates as <em>announced</em> is very general in meaning. Its basic meaning is to provide information. Other ways that you may be able to translate this Greek verb include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>reported (KJV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>informed</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>proclaimed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>by those who preached the gospel to you:</strong> Peter identified the means by which his readers heard about the prophecies and how Jesus Christ had fulfilled them. They heard it from <em>those</em>, which refers to the people who had <em>preached the gospel to</em> them.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>preached the gospel:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>preached the gospel</em> can also be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>announced the Good News (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>spread the Good News (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>brought…good news (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the gospel:</strong> The examples above show that <em>the gospel</em> means the good news. If your language requires you to state the content of the good news, what the good news is about, then you may be able to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the good news <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about Jesus Christ</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the good news <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about God saving people/you</span></p></blockquote><h4>1:12d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>through <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the power of</span> the Holy Spirit sent from heaven.</p></li><li><p>with <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the help of</span> the Holy Spirit whom God/Christ sent.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by the Holy Spirit:</strong> The phrase <em>by the Holy Spirit</em> means “under the Holy Spirit’s direction/leading” or “with the Holy Spirit’s power.” Various ways of translating this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>by the power of the Holy Spirit (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in the power of the Holy Spirit (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>with the help of the Holy Spirit (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Holy Spirit sent from heaven:</strong> The <em>Holy Spirit</em> is the same as the Spirit of Christ mentioned in 1:2b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sent from heaven:</strong> The phrase <em>sent from heaven</em> is passive. Peter does not say who sent the Holy Spirit, God or Christ. If your language requires you to specify who sent the Holy Spirit, you may supply either subject. If you have mentioned Christ as the one who sent the Spirit in 1:11b, then you may wish to repeat this. Otherwise, you may say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>by the Holy Spirit whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> sent from heaven</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>heaven:</strong> The word <em>heaven</em> is the name of the dwelling place of God. Saying <em>sent from heaven</em> is another way of saying “sent from God.” In some languages it may not be necessary to mention God and heaven separately and explicitly. See how you translated <em>heaven</em> in 1:4c.</p><h4>1:12e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Even angels long to look into these things.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Even <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the</span> angels are very interested in these things <span data-bnType=\"implied\">concerning our<sup>(incl)</sup> salvation</span>.</p></li><li><p>Even <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the holy</span> angels greatly desire to comprehend <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s plan to save us<sup>(incl)</sup></span>.</p></li><li><p>These events/things <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that God has done to save us<sup>(incl)</sup></span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">are so remarkable/wonderful that</span> even <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s holy</span> angels are intrigued/fascinated by them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Even angels long to look into these things:</strong> The <em>angels</em> do not need to be saved from sin and death. Even so, they want to understand God’s plan to save human beings. They are very interested in what God has done to deliver his people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Even:</strong> The BSB has supplied the word <em>Even</em>. It is not explicit in the Greek text. However, it does express the emphasis here, and many other translations also supply this word, as you may wish to do as well.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>angels:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>angels</em> here refers to the good spirit beings who serve God. It does not refer to the demons, the fallen <em>angels</em> who follow Satan. If just saying <em>angels</em> in your translation could be misunderstood to include demons, then you may need to make it clear which angels Peter was referring to. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">holy/good</span> angels.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s holy</span> angels.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>long:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>long</em> means “are strongly desiring.” Some other ways to translates this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>eagerly (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>greatly desire</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to look into:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates literally as <em>look</em> here means to try to “understand” or “comprehend” something. Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>know more about (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>these things:</strong> The phrase <em>these things</em> refers to the sufferings of Jesus the Messiah in his crucifixion and the glory of his resurrection. If a literal translation of <em>things</em> would refer to material objects, you may be able to say instead:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>these events</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>these facts</p></blockquote>",

Christ had paid a great price to save them (vv. 17–21) and had given them new life (vv. 23–25). In response to God’s kindness they should love one another (1:22).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Live Holy Lives (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Chosen To Live a Holy Life (CEV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:13a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Therefore prepare your minds for action.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Therefore, get your minds ready to act,</p></li><li><p>¶ So prepare your thinking <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to do what is right</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Therefore:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Therefore</em> introduces Peter’s words of practical teaching based on what he had just written in the preceding section. In this new section, Peter began to tell his readers how to think and act. Other ways you might be able to say this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So then (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of all that God has done for you</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>prepare your minds for action:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>prepare your minds for action</em> is literally “tie up the waist/loins of your<sup>(plur) </sup>mind.” This is a metaphor. In Peter’s time, men as well as women usually wore long robes. When they prepared to do hard work, the men pulled their robe up and tied it at their waist with a rope or belt. They were then ready <em>for action</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Peter applied this metaphor to his readers’ <em>minds</em>. He was telling them to be mentally ready <em>for action</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are various ways to translate this. For example:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep all of the metaphor:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>gird up the loins of your mind (KJV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Keep part of the metaphor:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>gird up your minds (RSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Give the meaning without the metaphor:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your minds…must be…ready for action (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>prepare your minds for action (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>be alert (CEV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use the form that is the most clear and natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for action:</strong> The phrase <em>for action</em> is not in the Greek text. Because the metaphor Peter used is not natural or understood in modern English, the BSB and some other versions have supplied the words <em>for action</em> to make the meaning of this metaphor clear.</p><h4>1:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Be sober-minded.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">and</span> think clearly.</p></li><li><p>Keep alert. (GNT)</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Be sober-minded:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates here as <em>Be sober-minded</em> is literally “be sober.” Since the context refers to the mind, Peter is probably not telling his readers here not to get physically drunk. Rather, this is a metaphor. Peter wanted his readers to think clearly and be alert and in control of their thoughts and actions. Some ways this may be translated are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your minds must be clear (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you must control your thoughts</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">A few translations understand the word “fully” to apply to “sober” rather than to “hope.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>with minds that are alert and fully sober (NIV)</p></blockquote><h4>1:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Set your hope fully on the grace to be given you</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Put your hope fully/totally on the good <span data-bnType=\"implied\">things that God</span> will give you</p></li><li><p>Have complete confidence in what <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God, because of his</span> kindness, will bring for you</p></li><li><p>Confidently look forward to the blessings that you will receive</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Set your hope fully on the grace to be given you:</strong> Peter told his readers to trust <em>fully</em> in God’s kindness towards them. Because of his kindness, God saved them. Peter wanted his readers to be completely confident that they would receive everything good associated with God saving them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Set your hope:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Set your hope</em> is literally the command “hope.” Other ways of translating this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>put…your hope (CEV, NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Place your confidence (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Look forward to (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>fully:</strong> The Greek adverb that the BSB translates as <em>fully</em> means “completely.” In some languages it may be natural to translate it as an adjective:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>put your full hope</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>on the grace to be given you:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>to be given you</em> is literally “being brought to you.” This is a passive clause. If it is more natural in your language to use an active verb, you may be able to use one of these models:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in what God’s kindness will bring you… (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to the special blessings that will come to you… (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>grace:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>grace</em> means “kindness, goodwill.” Here it refers to all the good things that God is going to give believers on the last day. These include all the blessings of the inheritance that God is keeping for them in heaven (1:4a–b), including eternal life and freedom from sin. This <em>grace</em> also includes the praise, glory and honor <em>to be given</em> to them by God (1:7d). See the note on the word <em>grace</em> at 1:10a. Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> kind/gracious help</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> loving kindness</p></blockquote><h4>1:13d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>at the revelation of Jesus Christ.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>when Jesus Christ will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">return and</span> show himself.</p></li><li><p>when Jesus Christ appears <span data-bnType=\"implied\">again</span>.</p></li><li><p>when Jesus Christ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">returns for people/everyone</span> will see him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>at the revelation of Jesus Christ:</strong> Peter used this phrase at 1:7e also. The meaning here is the same as it was at 1:7. <em>Jesus Christ</em> will return to this world on the last day. He will reveal himself to people everywhere in the world. Everyone will be able to see him. You may be able to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when Jesus Christ reveals himself (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when Jesus Christ appears again (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when Jesus Christ will return for everyone to see</p></blockquote>",

The meaning is that they are obedient. The English versions that use “as” are following this interpretation. <em>One translation that makes this interpretation explicit is GW, which says:</em></p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Because you are children who obey God, don’t live (GW) <em>(BSB, GW, NCV, NIV, RSV, KJV, NASB, NJB, JBP, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It describes what the believers’ behavior <u>should</u> be like.

This means that they were sons and daughters of God. God calls Christians his <em>children</em>, his sons and daughters, whether they are young or old (see John 1:12). If it is unnatural in your language to use the word <em>children</em> in this way, you may instead be able to refer to Christians as having God as their Father. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Since you obey God as your Father</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Since you are God’s obedient sons and daughters</p></blockquote><h4>1:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>do not conform to the passions of your former ignorance.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>do not pattern/model your lives after the evil desires you felt when you lived in ignorance <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of God</span>.</p></li><li><p>do not allow your desires to lead you to sin as you did before you knew <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span>.</p></li><li><p>do not do the wrong things you desired to do when you did not know God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>do not conform to the passions of your former ignorance:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>do not conform to</em> means “do not mold/pattern your lives after.” This verb is also found in Romans 12:2. Because Peter’s readers had become children of God, they were no longer to gratify their <em>passions</em> as they formerly did. Some other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>do not allow your lives to be shaped by those desires you had (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Don’t let your lives be controlled by your desires (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the passions of your former ignorance:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Of the English versions found in Translator’s Workplace, only the NLT has made the Greek word <em>epithumiais</em> implicit. Other versions have translated <em>epithumiais</em> as desires/lusts/passions/urges.</span></span> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>passions</em> is simply “desires.” This word generally implied wrong or selfish desires. The NIV has made this explicit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the evil desires</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If your language has a word or phrase that describes human desire to do something that is against God’s will, you could use it here. You do not necessarily need to include the word “<em>evil.”</em> For example, for “the passions” you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the lusts</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>your lusts</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>of your former ignorance:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>your former ignorance</em> refers to the time before Peter’s readers believed in Christ. At that time they were ignorant of God and his ways and his salvation. This phrase does not imply that Peter’s readers were uneducated or unintelligent people. Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>when you did not know any better</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>when you were unaware of God’s truth</p></blockquote>",

In this case, the contrast is between what Peter told his readers not to do in 1:14 and what he told them to do here in this verse. Indicate this contrast in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Instead (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>just as He who called you is holy:</strong> There are two ways of interpreting the role or function of the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>holy</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is an adjective describing God. The quality of holiness is attributed to him. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as he who called you is holy (RSV) <em>(BSB, GNT, GW, NIV, KJV, NCV, NLT, REB, RSV, CEV, JBP)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is a title for God and functions as a noun: the Holy One.

In some languages it may be necessary to make that explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>just as <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> who called you is holy (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>called:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>called</em> refers to God’s invitation to Peter’s readers to be in a relationship with him. In some languages it may be necessary to say what God called these people to do. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>called you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be his people</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>chose you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be his children</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">“To be his children” is a good choice in this context, since in 1:14 Peter spoke of his readers as obedient children of God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>holy:</strong> In this context, the word <em>holy</em> refers to fully serving God. It also refers to living a good, morally pure life. (It also means “to be pure” and “free from sin.”) Some other examples for translating are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>dedicated to God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>fully serving God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">morally</span> pure</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">morally</span> upright</p></blockquote><h4>1:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so be holy in all you do,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>you should be holy in everything you do.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">you also</span> should be holy in all your conduct.</p></li><li><p>your behavior should be completely good <span data-bnType=\"implied\">too</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so:</strong> This verse part starts with the common Greek conjunction that normally means “and.” The BSB has translated it as “so.” Some English versions do not translate this conjunction in this context. Translate this conjunction in a way that is natural in your language to link 1:15b with 1:15a. Another way to translate it is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>also (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>be holy in all you do:</strong> The Greek text here contains a word that the BSB has left implicit. This word could be literally translated as “yourselves,” as in “be holy <u>yourselves</u> in all….” Its purpose is to emphasize the subject “you.” Consider if you have a natural way to show this emphasis.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways you may be able to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so you yourselves must/should always do what is right</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>now you must be holy in everything you do (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you must be holy in every aspect of your life. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>holy:</strong> It is important to use the same word here that you used in the previous verse part. In both verse parts translate with a word or phrase that can apply both to God and to people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in all you do:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>all you do</em> is a noun phrase that literally means “whole way of life” or “all conduct/behavior.” Several English versions have translated it as a noun or noun phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in all your activity (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You may translate it with a verb, as the BSB does, or as a noun phrase, whichever is more natural in your language. Some other ways it has been translated include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in every aspect of your life (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in all your conduct (RSV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:15</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reverse the order of verse parts 15a and 15b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Instead, be holy in all that you do, just as God who called you is holy. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Instead, <sup>15b</sup>you should always do what is right, <sup>15a</sup>because God called you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be his children</span> and he always does what is right.</p></blockquote></div>",

If you do not already know what you are going to call the writings in the Old Testament, you may be able to refer to the whole Old Testament as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Book <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of God</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Holy</span> Writing(s)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Scriptures</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You may want or need a more specific key term for the first five books of the Old Testament, which includes Leviticus. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Law</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>it is written</em> uses a passive verb. If your language requires you to say who did the writing, since Moses wrote Leviticus, you may be able to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Moses</span> wrote in the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Holy</span> Writing(s)</p></blockquote><h4>1:16b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:16b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Be holy, because I am holy.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“Be holy, because I <span data-bnType=\"implied\">your God</span> am holy.”</p></li><li><p>“Be completely good, because I am completely good.”</p></li><li><p>“because I do <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what is</span> right, you too must/should do <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what is</span> right.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Be holy:</strong> This is a command that is a quotation of Leviticus 19:2. God was commanding his people to <em>Be holy</em>. Try to use the same word for <em>holy</em> that you used to describe God in 1:15.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Septuagint translated Leviticus 19:2 with the word for “holy” that Peter used. Jesus also quoted Leviticus 19:2 during the Sermon on the Mount, but Matthew’s account used a different Greek word, sometimes translated as “perfect,” than did Peter and the Septuagint. In Matthew 5:48, Jesus was speaking to Jews, people who grew up thinking of themselves as being God’s chosen people. Many had a deficient understanding of the righteousness necessary to have eternal life. In the context of the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus was telling the people that God’s standard of performance, in this case of loving, is no less than God’s own perfection. Peter, on the other hand, was writing largely to Gentiles who were not raised with this understanding. They had embraced Christ and His righteousness. The problem was not that the standard was set too low by tradition. Peter cautions them against the type of sin that their desires led them to commit before they were born again. Their call is to sanctification, to holiness. Peter may also have been playing on the fact that Christians were referred to as the saints, from the same root word that he used here for “holy.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>Be holy</em> is literally “You shall be holy.” God used a future statement to give a command. Many translations (for example, ESV, NASB, NET) translate this as a future statement. Translate it in the way that would be most natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I am holy:</strong> God was the original speaker of these words. At Leviticus 19:2, God identifies himself as the speaker. If in this context it would be natural in your language for God to identify himself, then you may be able to translate this in a similar way to the CEV, which says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am the holy God (CEV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:16a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to give the reason why God’s people were to be holy before the command to be holy. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God says</span> in the Scriptures/Writings, “I am holy, so you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">too</span> must be holy.”</p></blockquote></div>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You say that God is your Father (CEV) <em>(BSB, NIV, NCV, NLT, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>if</u> and introduces a statement that may or may not be true. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If you address as Father (NASB) <em>(GW, KJV, NET, NJB, REB, RSV, NASB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Peter definitely thought of his readers as being God’s children who prayed to him as their Father (see 1:14a). Therefore, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you call on a Father:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>you call on a Father</em> refers to calling God “Father” when speaking to him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You call him Father, when you pray to God (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice also that the GNT has included the phrase “when you pray to God” to make it clear that Peter was talking about praying to God.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>a Father:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>a Father</em> refers to God. In some languages it may be necessary to make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>You pray to God and call him Father (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>1:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who judges each one’s work impartially,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>judges everyone’s conduct fairly,</p></li><li><p>He judges each person according to what they have done, without favouring one above another.</p></li><li><p>treats all people in the same way; he decides according to what they have done.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who judges each one’s work impartially:</strong> This phrase describes God the Father. In some languages it may be natural to translate it as a separate sentence:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He judges each one’s work impartially.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you have not yet made it explicit that Peter is talking about God, it may be natural to do so here:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the God</span> who judges each one’s work impartially</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>judges:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>judges</em> here means to decide or declare whether something is right or wrong. In this context it does not specifically mean “condemn.” Some work God declares to be right and good, and some work he <em>judges</em> to be wrong and evil.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek verb <em>judges</em> refers to God’s judging activity in general. It does not specifically refer to any particular act of judging, past or future. The NLT translates <em>judges</em> here as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>judge or reward (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>each one’s:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates here as <em>each one’s</em> includes all human beings. Other ways to translate <em>each one’s</em> include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>each person’s (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>everybody’s</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>each individual’s (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>work:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>work</em> refers to someone’s conduct or lifestyle as a whole. There are several ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a singular noun:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>work (NIV11)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a verb phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>what they have done</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a plural noun:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>their actions</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use the word or phrase that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>impartially:</strong> The word that the BSB translates as <em>impartially</em> literally means “without receiving faces” or “without receiving persons.” In other words, it means that God judges all people the same way, regardless of who they are. God is fair; he judges people justly, without bias or prejudice. Other ways to say that God judges “<em>impartially”</em> include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who judges everyone fairly</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who judges all people according to their actions without favoritism (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who judges all people by the same standard (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Your language may have a suitable idiom that means “without favoring one person over another.” This idiom may use the idea of “face,” as the Greek expression does.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:17a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to translate 1:17a–b as a separate sentence:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You call on <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God as</span> your Father, and he judges each person without partiality.</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:17c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:17c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>conduct yourselves in reverent fear during your stay as foreigners.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>conduct yourselves with respectful fear <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of him</span> while you live here as strangers.</p></li><li><p>So you should respect/revere <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> during your time living here as strangers.</p></li><li><p>Therefore, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you should</span> live with reverent awe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for him</span> during your temporary residence/stay here <span data-bnType=\"implied\">on earth</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">1:17c gives the conclusion Peter drew from his statement in 1:17a–b. If you have translated 1:17a–b as a separate sentence, it may be natural to make it clear that 1:17c is a conclusion by using a word meaning “so” or “therefore.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">So</span> you should live your lives as strangers here in reverent fear.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>conduct yourselves in reverent fear during your stay as foreigners:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>conduct yourselves in reverent fear during your stay as foreigners</em> may be translated literally as “conduct the time of your exile in fear.” The Greek text refers explicitly to the <u>time</u> when Peter’s readers were living in this world, away from heaven, their true home. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>live out the time of your temporary residence here (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>while you are living in exile here on earth, behave</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>reverent fear:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>reverent fear</em> is literally “fear.” In this context it refers to awe and wonder at the greatness and holiness of God. Other ways to translate it include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>reverence (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>awe (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>respect (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>stay as foreigners:</strong> The phrase <em>stay as foreigners</em> means that Peter’s readers were only temporary residents of this world. His words imply that a Christian’s eternal home is with God in heaven (see 1:1c).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Many English versions make the location of this temporary residence explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>during the time of your stay on earth (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>during your time on earth (REB)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:17a–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Verse parts 17a–b give the reason for what Peter told his readers to do in 1:17c. In some languages it may be more natural to translate the command first, before the reason for it. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>17c</sup>During your stay here as temporary residents <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of this earth</span>, behave with a respectful fear <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of God</span>, <sup>17b</sup>because he judges everyone’s conduct fairly, <sup>17a</sup>and you call him “Father.”</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>17c</sup>Live in reverence for God during your stay here on earth. <sup>17a</sup>For you call him “Father,” <sup>17b</sup>and he is the impartial Judge of what everyone does.</p></blockquote></div>",

Peter said something similar about gold perishing at 1:7b–c.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>perishable things:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>perishable things</em> here means “things that will not last for ever”; that is, finite things. One day all material things, including silver and gold, will pass away or come to an end.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">At 1:4b, Peter used the negative form of this same Greek word (“imperishable”). However, the way <em>perishable</em> is translated in this verse must go naturally with <em>silver or gold</em>. For this reason, you may not be able to use here a form of the word you used at 1:4b.

Here in this verse, Peter told what price God <u>did pay</u> to redeem them.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You were set free by Christ’s precious blood, blood like that of a lamb without mark or blemish.

The contrast is between perishable things such as silver or gold and “the precious blood of Christ.” Show this contrast in your language in a way that is natural. Some other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>instead</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>rather</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or spot:</strong> There are several ways of understanding what Peter was saying in this verse part:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>He was comparing the <em>blood of Christ</em> to the blood of a lamb without blemish or defect. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot (RSV) <em>(KJV, NASB, REB, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>He was comparing <em>Christ</em> to a <em>lamb without blemish or spot</em>.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>precious blood like that of an unblemished and spotless lamb, namely Christ (NET) <em>(NJB, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) and the majority of commentators.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>with the precious blood of Christ:</strong> Peter was referring here to the blood that Jesus shed while he was dying on the cross. His blood spilled out as he was giving his life as a sacrifice. In some languages it may be necessary to make some of this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>with the precious lifeblood of Christ (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>with the precious blood that Christ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">shed on the cross</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>precious:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>precious</em> means “valuable, of great worth.” Here is another way to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>costly (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a lamb without blemish or spot:</strong> In the Old Testament, God told the Israelites that the lambs they were to sacrifice must be <em>without…spot</em> (Leviticus 23:12; Numbers 6:14). The <em>lamb</em> used at Passover Festival also had to be <em>without…spot</em> (Exodus 12:5).</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>without blemish or spot:</strong> The sacrificial lamb had to be physically perfect. Jesus Christ was the perfect sacrifice in the sense that he was without sin. So if possible, the words that you use to translate <em>without blemish or spot</em> should apply to both physical and spiritual or moral perfection.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>without blemish or spot</em> are literally “unblemished and spotless.” These two words are very similar in meaning. Using the two together emphasizes the physical perfection of the lamb.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways that you may be able to translate this phrase include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>pure and perfect (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>with no flaws</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>flawless</p></blockquote>",

So by it he meant the entire church, including both men and women. So you could translate this phrase as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>affection towards your fellow-Christians (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>love for other believers (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>love for your Christian brothers and sisters (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>mutual love (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>love:</strong> It may be more natural in your language to translate <em>love</em> as a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>sincerely love (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>truly love</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>honestly love</p></blockquote><h4>1:22c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:22c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>love one another deeply, from a pure heart.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>So <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am telling you to</span> love one another very much with <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all</span> your heart.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Therefore, you should</span> love each other truly and earnestly.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>love one another deeply:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates here as <em>love</em> is a command, and it is the main verb of this sentence (1:22–23).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>love:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>love</em> here is a different word than the one at 1:22b. You may use the same word in your translation for both, since the meanings are very similar. However, if it would be more natural in your language to use two different words, then you may do as Peter did in Greek.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>deeply:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>deeply</em> can also be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>warmly (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>earnestly (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>fervently</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>from a pure heart:</strong> There is a textual issue here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some Greek texts have <u>from a pure heart</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>from a pure heart (ESV) <em>(BSB, ESV, KJV, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Some Greek texts have <u>from the heart</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>from the heart (NRSV) <em>(GW, NASB, NIV, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1), since that reading is found in several reliable ancient manuscripts.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>pure:</strong> In this context, the word <em>pure</em> refers to something that has nothing else mixed in with it. Other ways to say this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>from a sincere heart</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>with genuine affection</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>heart:</strong> In the minds of Peter’s readers, the <em>heart</em> was associated with thoughts and ideas as well as emotions and feelings. So the Greek word that many English versions translate as <em>heart</em> is an idiom that means much the same as “deeply.” If you choose to use a figure of speech, use an idiom or metaphor from your own language that refers to seeking someone else’s well-being.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions keep the <em>heart</em> figure. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>love each other deeply with all your heart (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>love one another wholeheartedly with all your strength (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to remove the <em>heart</em> figure.

Christ had paid a great price to save them (vv. 17–21) and had given them new life (vv. 23–25). In response to God’s kindness they should love one another (1:22).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Live Holy Lives (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Chosen To Live a Holy Life (CEV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:23</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In this verse, Peter gave his readers another reason for his exhortation in 1:22c. They had been born again through God’s permanent living word (1:23). Therefore, they ought to love each other fervently (1:22c).</p><h4>1:23a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:23a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For you have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For you have been born again, not from perishable seed, but from seed that does not perish,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Do this</span> because you have received new life/birth, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and it is</span> not from seed that dies, but from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">seed</span> that does not die,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You should love each other</span> because it is by means of something indestructible that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God has made</span> your lives new. It is not by means of seed that will not last.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> In Greek, this verse begins with a participle that signals that Peter is writing an <u>additional reason/basis</u> for his readers to love each other, as he urged them to do in 1:22c. Some other ways to signal this relationship are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>since…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do this because…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You should love each other because…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you have been born again:</strong> The Greek participle that the BSB translates as <em>you have been born again</em> is passive.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>These are the only two places that the verb <em>anagennaō </em>is used in the New Testament.</span></span> Peter used the active form of this verb at 1:3b. Refer to your translation of that verse and the note there on “He has given us new birth.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Your language may require that you make this clause active and specify who caused them to be born again. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God has caused you to be born again (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God has given you a new life</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God has made your lives new</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not of perishable seed:</strong> The phrase <em>not of perishable seed</em> means “not from a seed that will perish.” It was not some finite or material seed that gave Peter’s readers new birth. See the note on 1:18b, where the same Greek word for <em>perishable</em> is used.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word that the BSB translates literally as <em>seed</em> can refer to either male seed or plant seed. Therefore there are two ways of interpreting the phrase <em>perishable seed</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to human reproduction.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Selwyn, pages 150–151; Kelly, page 80; Marshall, page 61; Achtemeier, page 139; Lenski, page 73.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>not of mortal…parentage (REB) <em>(NLT, GNT, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to the seeds of plants.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Kistemaker, page 72.</span></span> This is the more normal use of the English word <em>seed</em>.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Since the Greek word can mean both things, the original readers could have thought of both kinds of seed.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Michaels, page 76.</span></span> If you must choose between the two, it is recommended that you choose interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but of imperishable:</strong> The word <em>imperishable</em> modifies the implied word “seed.” “Imperishable seed” is a figure of speech that illustrates how Peter’s readers received their new life. There are two ways of understanding what it refers to:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to God’s word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but imperishable, that is…the…word of God (NASB) <em>(NJB, GW, NLT, CEV, NASB; probably NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a parent who is immortal (GNT) <em>(REB, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions are ambiguous and do not say to what “imperishable seed” refers (KJV, NET, RSV). If you must choose one of the two interpretations, it is recommended that you follow the interpretation (1).</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:23a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may not be possible to keep the <em>seed</em> figure of speech. Some English versions have translated without this figure. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>this new life did not come from something that dies, but from something that cannot die (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">However, because of the context, it is recommended that you do keep the seed figure or a similar figure, if possible.</p></div><h4>1:23b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:23b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>through the living and enduring word of God.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>through the living and permanent word/message from God.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">that is,</span> through God’s word/message which lives forever.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He/God made your lives new</span> by means of his living word/message that never dies.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>through:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>through</em> here means “by means of.” In this context it apparently means much the same as the preposition translated as “of” in 1:23a. The word of God was the means that God used to give the believers new birth. Here is another way to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>by (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>living and enduring:</strong> The words <em>living and enduring</em> are similar in meaning. They are used together for emphasis. Other ways that you may be able to say <em>living and enduring</em> include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>living and abiding (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>living and eternal (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that lives for ever</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that lives and never dies</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>word of God:</strong> The phrase the <em>word of God</em> refers to the same thing as “the truth” in 1:22a. It is the message from God concerning the good news about Jesus Christ. Other ways you may be able to say <em>word of God</em> include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s message</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>word/message from God</p></blockquote>",

The quotation is from Isaiah 40:6–8. Isaiah illustrated how short the lives of people are by comparing them to grass and wild flowers that live for only a short time. In contrast, the word of the Lord endures for ever.</p><h4>1:24a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:24a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Scripture says</span>:</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The Scripture says</span>:</p></li><li><p>Because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as the prophet Isaiah said/wrote</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>For</em> signals that what follows supports or illustrates what Peter wrote in 1:23. What follows is a quotation from the Old Testament. Peter quoted the prophet Isaiah (Isaiah 40:6–8). It is recommended that you make it clear to your readers that this is a quotation. You could do this in a footnote or make it explicit in the text. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As the scripture says (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>That’s why <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Scripture says</span> (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The prophet Isaiah said/wrote</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you follow the first or second example, you may translate “Scripture” with the term you use for the Old Testament. If you have a more specific term for the writings of the Old Testament prophets, you may use it here.</p><h4>1:24b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:24b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“All flesh is like grass,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“All people are like grass,</p></li><li><p>“Human <span data-bnType=\"implied\">life</span> is like grass,</p></li><li><p>“We<sup>(incl)</sup> are all like grass <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that dies quickly</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>All flesh is like grass:</strong> This is a simile. Peter is quoting the prophet Isaiah, who was comparing people to grass in order to illustrate and emphasize that they only live for a short time. In some languages it may be necessary to make the point of comparison explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Humans wither like grass (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>People are like grass that dies away (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In other languages it may be more natural to make the comparison by using a metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all humanity is grass (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>All flesh:</strong> This is the beginning of what Peter quoted from the Old Testament. The Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>All flesh</em> refer to people. Some English versions have chosen to translate it literally (KJV, NASB, NET, RSV). In this context it refers to all human beings, both male and female. Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>All people (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>grass:</strong> Peter was referring to the wild grass that grows in an open area or field. The term <em>grass</em> here seems to include the various plants that grow in among the grass and have flowers. It is recommended that you use a general word for <em>grass</em> in your language.</p><h4>1:24c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:24c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and all its glory like the flowers of the field;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and all of their beauty/importance is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">temporary</span>, like the wildflowers.</p></li><li><p>and human beauty fades quickly, like the beauty of wild flowers in the field.</p></li><li><p>We<sup>(incl)</sup> quickly lose our beauty/attractiveness, just as wildflowers do.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and all its glory like the flowers of the field:</strong> This is another simile. Peter quoted Isaiah, comparing human good looks to wild flowers. They are similar in that both last for only a short time. In some languages it may be natural or necessary to make this point of comparison explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>their glory fades like wild flowers (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>their beauty fades as quickly as the beauty of wildflowers (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>its glory:</strong> In this context, the word that the BSB and most English versions translate as <em>glory</em> refers to human attractiveness<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In some languages, it might be possible to refer more generally to “strength” or “vitality” associated with youth.</span></span> or good looks. Several English versions have translated this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>beauty (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the flowers of the field:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the flowers of the field</em> is literally “flower of grass.” The Greek word for “grass” here is the same as in 1:24b. Apparently, this Greek word included the flowering plants that grow in fields with grass. (See the note on “grass” at 1:24b.) Some English versions have translated this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wild flowers (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>1:24d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:24d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the grass withers and the flowers fall,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Grass withers and flowers drop <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from their stems</span>,</p></li><li><p>The grass dies and the flower falls <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to the ground</span>,</p></li><li><p>The grass becomes dry and the flowers die,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the grass withers and the flowers fall:</strong> In this verse part, Peter quoted Isaiah, explaining in what way grass and wild flowers are like people and different from the word of God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the grass withers:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>withers</em> here means that the grass dries up and dies. Other ways this has been translated include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>dies (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>dries up (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the flowers fall:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>fall</em> means “to fall off/from.” In this context, the <em>flowers</em>, having served their brief purpose, fell off the stems that supported them. Other ways you may be able to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the flower drops off (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the flower falls away (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the flowers fall <span data-bnType=\"implied\">down</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from their stems</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the flowers fall <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to the ground</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You may use flower<sup>(sing)</sup> or <em>flowers</em><sup>(plur)</sup>, whichever sounds most natural in your language.</p>",

Other ways this word has been translated include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>lasts (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>remains (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will live (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>1:25b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:25b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And this is the word that was proclaimed to you.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And this is the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">same</span> word/message that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they/people</span> preached to you.</p></li><li><p>This word/message <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of/from the Lord</span> is the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">good news</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about Jesus Christ</span> that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you heard</span>.</p></li><li><p>The <span data-bnType=\"implied\">gospel</span> that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his/the-Lord’s followers</span> announced to you is this word/message <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that remains forever</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">The quotation from Isaiah 40:6–8 ended with 1:25a.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>That word is the good news that was announced to you.

People used this word to speak of taking off old clothing and of removing dirt from the body. Peter meant that his readers were to be completely finished with the sins he was about to list. They were not to act like this any more.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways you may be able to translate this verb include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>avoid <span data-bnType=\"implied\">doing</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>refrain <span data-bnType=\"implied\">completely</span> from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">doing</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>do not even consider <span data-bnType=\"implied\">doing</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>therefore:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>therefore</em> signals that what Peter was about to write followed from something he had already written. Most likely, it follows from what Peter wrote in 1:22–25 concerning his readers having been born again through the living and enduring word of God. You may be able to say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Because of this, rid yourselves</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Since you have been born again through God’s word, rid yourselves</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated “Therefore” in 1:13a.</p><h4>2:1b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>malice, deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander:</strong> There are two ways of interpreting the relationship of the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>malice</em> to the rest of the list:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><em>Malice</em> refers to hostile attitudes and behavior towards other people; it is a specific sin, like the others in the list. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>spite (NJB) <em>(BSB, KJV, CEV, NASB, RSV, NJB, NIV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p><em>Malice</em> refers to evil in general and summarizes the specific sins that follow. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>evil (GNT) <em>(REB, NET, GW, NCV, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). See the notes below for more information on each of these words.</p><h4>2:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>all malice, deceit,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">doing</span> anything malicious, and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from</span> deceiving <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> in any way,</p></li><li><p>do anything to harm <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other people</span>, or lie <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to trick them</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>all:</strong> In this context, the Greek word that the BSB twice translates as <em>all</em> means “any and every” or “all kinds of.” Peter actually uses this word three times in this list, for emphasis. Some translations show this. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>malice:</strong> The word <em>malice</em> refers to having the desire to hurt other people or to see others suffer. In some languages it may be necessary to translate abstract nouns such as <em>malice</em> as verb phrases:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>being hateful (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>hurting/harming other people</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>deceit:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>deceit</em> refers to such as craftiness, treachery, and telling lies in order to trick people. Other ways to translate the word <em>deceit</em> include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>deception (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>lying (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>deceiving people</p></blockquote><h4>2:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>hypocrisy, envy, and slander.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">from</span> lying about yourself, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from</span> jealousy, and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from</span> any speaking evil about others.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You should never</span> pretend to be different/better than you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">really</span> are, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">or</span> envy <span data-bnType=\"implied\">others</span>, or speak unkindly<span data-bnType=\"implied\">about them</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>hypocrisy:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>hypocrisy</em> means pretending to be something other than what you really are. This word could also be used of an insincere person.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If your language does not use abstract nouns such as <em>hypocrisy</em>, then you may be able to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Do not lie about yourself</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You should not pretend to be different/better than you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">really</span> are</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Never be insincere</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>envy:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>envy</em> refers to resenting or hating someone else because of their greater possessions, abilities, or status. It can also be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>jealousy (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>slander:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>slander</em> means to say something untrue about a person in order to hurt him.

He told the believers to desire God’s word in the same way that babies desire their mothers’ milk. In this way they would continue to grow strong as Christians until they experienced the final salvation God had for them.</p><h4>2:2a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>As new babies long/thirst for milk, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so you should</span> long/thirst for <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> pure <span data-bnType=\"implied\">word/message</span>,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You should</span> desire <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to hear/receive</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> truthful <span data-bnType=\"implied\">word/message</span> just as a newborn baby wants <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to drink</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">its mother’s</span> milk.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Like newborn babies:</strong> This is a simile. Peter was saying that his readers should have a strong desire for God’s word, just as babies have a strong desire for their mother’s milk.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>newborn babies:</strong> This is the only place in the New Testament where the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>newborn</em> is used. Its use here probably implies that the <em>babies</em> in Peter’s illustration had no other food and wanted no other food. Those who are <em>newborn babies</em> are completely dependent on their mothers’ milk.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>babies:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>babies</em> refers to very small children. Several English versions translate it as “infants.” For example, the NET says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>yearn like newborn infants for… (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If your language has a word or expression referring to babies in the first few weeks of their life, you may be able to use it here. In that case it may not be necessary to translate <em>newborn</em> separately and explicitly.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>crave pure spiritual milk:</strong> The phrase <em>crave pure spiritual milk</em> describes how Peter wanted his readers to be like newborn babies. The <em>pure spiritual milk</em> is a metaphor for God’s word. Peter wanted them to <em>crave</em> it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>crave:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>crave</em> is a command meaning “desire.” Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Be…thirsty for (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>long for (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>yearn…for (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek text has a definite article that is not explicit in the BSB. Many English versions do make it explicit. For example, the RSV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>long for the pure spiritual milk</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Consider if it is natural in your language to make the definite article explicit in this context. In some language doing so may help show that <u>the</u> <em>pure spiritual milk</em> is a metaphor.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>pure:</strong> The Greek adjective that the BSB translates as <em>pure</em> can means “sincere” or “without deceit.” As a description of milk, it can be translated as “unadulterated,” that is, not watered down. As a description of God’s word, it can be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>truthful<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In English, there is a problem with translating this as “true.” The Greek word that precedes (lemma: <em>logikos</em>) is understood by some scholars to signal that this is figurative, being a metaphor, not literal. To say then that it is “true…milk” is potentially contradictory. For this reason, the suggestion in the Notes is for “truthful,” not “true.”</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Consider if there is a word in your language that could cover both ideas. If not, you will have to choose between describing the metaphor (<em>milk</em>) or the topic the metaphor represents (God’s word).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>spiritual milk:</strong> There is a play on words here. The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>spiritual</em> is from a root meaning “word.” Peter was implying that the <em>spiritual milk</em> was a figure of speech referring to the word of God.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See the footnote in the NET. Translations vary as to which aspect of the figure of speech they translate:(1) “spiritual” (BSB, NJB, NIV, RSV, GNT, REB, NET, NLT, CEV)(2) “of the word” (KJV, NASB, GW, NCV)</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>milk:</strong> Here, <em>milk</em> refers to a mother’s milk. It represents food that is nourishing and life-giving, and it is a metaphor for God’s word. If you make this explicit, you may want to consider how you translated “the word of God” and “the word of the Lord” at 1:23b and 1:25a. See the General Comment below for more information.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:2a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be necessary to make explicit something of the meaning of the metaphor in 2:2a. There are various ways of doing this. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Desire God’s pure word as newborn babies desire milk. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As newborn babies want milk, you should want the pure and simple teaching. (NCV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that by it you may grow up in your salvation,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that by/through <span data-bnType=\"implied\">this word</span> you may grow strong/mature and receive full salvation.</p></li><li><p>in order for it <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to nourish</span> you until you are completely saved.</p></li><li><p>Then, by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">continuing to feed on</span> it, you will thrive until <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">saves you from all sin</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that by it you may grow up:</strong> Peter wanted his readers to desire God’s word (2:2a) so that they would continue to listen to it and/or read it. In this way they would receive spiritual nourishment and become strong and mature believers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>so that:</strong> The Greek preposition that the BSB translates as <em>so that</em> introduces the purpose for desiring (and therefore receiving) spiritual milk. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Then (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>by it:</strong> God’s word/teaching was to be the means by which Peter’s readers received their spiritual food. Peter was implying that because they desired God’s word, the believers would actually hear and read it. The GNT has made this explicit by including <u>drinking</u> as part of the milk metaphor:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that by drinking it you may grow up (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you may grow up:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>you may grow up</em> is a form of a Greek verb that could mean <em>grow</em> or “increase” or “spread.” It can also be translated as “thrive.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>E. G. Selwyn, in his commentary on the First Epistle of St. Peter, translates <em>auxēthēte</em> as “thrives,” page 156.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that you may thrive on it (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Peter was not telling his readers that they would <em>grow up</em> and no longer need the milk of God’s word. In Peter’s metaphor, all Christians remain babies who continue to need the nourishment of this milk in order to grow. Peter wanted his readers to continue to feed on God’s word and <em>grow</em> until their final <em>salvation</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The way you translate this may depend on what sounds natural in your language. Some ways to say this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">drink</span> it and grow</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it will nourish you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">continuing to drink</span> it you will thrive</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that will help you grow (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in your salvation:</strong> There are two ways of interpreting the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>in your salvation</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “resulting in your salvation”; that is, towards the goal of receiving final salvation from God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>grow and be saved (CEV) <em>(GNT, NJB, REB, NET, CEV, NCV, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “in or in regards to your salvation,” that is, it refers to becoming a strong and mature believer. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>grow into a full experience of salvation (NLT) <em>(BSB, NLT, NIV, NASB, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Peter was probably talking about the same salvation he referred to in 1:5. This is the salvation when God will deliver believers from all sin and suffering.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your salvation:</strong> In some languages it may be necessary to translate the abstract noun <em>salvation</em> as a verb:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you may…be saved (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> may/will save you</p></blockquote>",

They had already experienced that the Lord is kind.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Peter used words from Psalm 34:8. His readers would recognize these words, even though Peter modified the words in order to apply them directly to these believers. Because Peter modified these words, most English versions do not introduce this verse as an Old Testament quotation.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some ways to show that 2:3 is a quote from the Psalms are:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Say in a footnote that Peter was referring to Psalm 34:8.</p></li><li><p>Introduce it in the text as a quotation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As the scripture says, “You have found out for yourselves how kind the Lord is.” (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>now that:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>now that</em> is literally “if.” In this context this word introduces a condition that had been fulfilled. Peter believed that his readers had already experienced that the Lord is kind. He was assuming that this was true. Different ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>since</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you have tasted:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>you have tasted</em> continues the metaphor of babies drinking milk. Peter is using the word <em>tasted</em> as a figure of speech here to mean “experienced.” It is possible to translate this figure of speech in two ways:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Continuing with the “milk” metaphor of 2:2. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you have already tasted (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you have had a taste (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translating the meaning of the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You have found out for yourselves (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you have experienced (NET)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Whether or not you choose a verb that continues the “milk” metaphor will depend on which way communicates best in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that the Lord is good:</strong> Peter has already explained in chapter 1 how kind <em>the Lord</em> had been to these Christians. Peter’s readers were able to know this because they knew what Christ had done to save them from sin and death.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Lord:</strong> In the verse in the Psalms from which Peter was quoting, <em>the Lord</em> refers to God. Most scholars agree, however, that here in 1 Peter <em>the Lord</em> refers to Christ. The English versions do not make this explicit. It is recommended that you use a word for <em>Lord</em> that can refer to both God and Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>good:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>good</em> is an adjective that describes <em>the Lord</em>.

He quoted three passages from the Old Testament that also used the metaphor of a stone to speak about the Christ whom God had promised to send:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>In 2:6 Peter quoted from Isaiah 28:16.</p></li><li><p>In 2:7 Peter quoted from Psalm 118:22.</p></li><li><p>In 2:8 Peter quoted from Isaiah 8:14.</p></li></ol></div><h4>2:4a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:4a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>As you come to Him, the living stone,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ You come to him, the stone <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who</span> lives,</p></li><li><p>¶ You are coming to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus Christ</span>, who is like a stone that is alive.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>As you come to Him:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>As you come</em> is literally “coming.” There are two ways to interpret this word:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It states a fact. Peter’s readers were coming to Jesus Christ. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You are coming to Christ (GW) <em>(BSB, KJV, NASB, NET, NIV, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is a command. Peter told his readers to come to Christ. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Come to him (RSV) <em>(GNT, CEV, NCV, NJB, NLT, REB, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Peter was encouraging his readers. He was writing about what happened as they came to Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>come to Him:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>come to Him</em> refers to believers approaching Christ in worship and service. It could also refer to new believers coming to Christ in faith for salvation. You should translate <em>come</em> in a general way that could include both of these meanings.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This note assumes interpretation (1) for the meaning of “as you come.” If a translation follows interpretation (2), then the coming to Christ refers to conversion.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>to Him:</strong> The Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>to him</em> may be translated literally as “to whom.” This refers to “the Lord” in 2:3, who is Jesus Christ. Some English versions have made this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>to the Lord Jesus (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the living stone:</strong> Since stones are not alive, the adjective <em>living</em> shows that Peter was using a figure of speech. He was using the metaphor of a <em>living stone</em> to refer to Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It may be more natural in your language to translate this metaphor as a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who is like a living stone</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>living:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>living</em> means “lives” or “is alive.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other places in this letter where Peter used the Greek word that the BSB translates here as <em>living</em> are 1:3, 1:23, 2:5, 4:5.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Peter used other, nonparticipial forms of the verb <em>zaō </em>at 2:24 and 4:6.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>stone:</strong> Some translations, such as the NIV, capitalize the word “Stone” because in this context it is a title for God the Son. The Greek text permits capitalizing the word. The earliest Greek manuscripts were written in all capital letters, and so it is not possible to determine from them what words the authors would have capitalized if they had been following modern conventions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In New Testament times, houses and temples were generally built out of stones. The context makes it clear that Peter was referring to a stone of the size and shape that people could use for building.</p><h4>2:4b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:4b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>rejected by men but chosen and precious in God’s sight,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">a stone</span> rejected by people but chosen and valued by God.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Even though</span> people discarded <span data-bnType=\"implied\">this stone</span>, to God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">it was</span> precious/priceless, and God chose/selected <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to use</span> it.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>rejected by men but chosen and precious in God’s sight:</strong> This verse part contrasts how people viewed the living Stone with how God viewed it.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This contrast is marked with the particles <em>men</em> and <em>de</em>. See the notes on 1:20a, where Peter used the same construction.</span></span> Other ways to indicate this contrast include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>On the one hand</u>, it was rejected by people, while on the other hand, it was chosen by God and precious to him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>though rejected by mortals yet chosen and precious in God’s sight (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to replace the passive forms <em>rejected</em> and <em>chosen</em> with active verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Even though people rejected it, God chose it and valued it</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>rejected:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>rejected</em> can also be translated as “did not accept.” In the metaphor, people chose not to use this particular stone. The meaning in the metaphor is that people did not accept Jesus as the Messiah. Other ways you may be able to say this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Many people…did not want this stone (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This stone</span> was discarded by human beings</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>People treated it/him with disdain/contempt</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>by men:</strong> In this context, the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>men</em> means people in general, including both <em>men</em> and women. Some translations make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>rejected by human beings (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>rejected by the people (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>rejected by mortals (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>chosen and precious in God’s sight:</strong> The Greek expression that the BSB translates as <em>chosen…and precious</em> is literally “chosen, precious.” The GNT makes the implied relationship between the adjectives explicit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>chosen by God as valuable (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>chosen:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>chosen</em> in this context means “selected.” In the metaphor, God selected this particular stone because he considered it valuable.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a passive clause. In some languages it may be more natural to use an active verb:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God chose it</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he was the stone God chose (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>precious:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>precious</em> indicates that God considered the living stone, Jesus Christ, to be very valuable. Other ways to translate <em>precious</em> include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>immensely valuable (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>priceless (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>of great worth (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>in God’s sight:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>in God’s sight</em> is literally “with God.” The BSB uses an English idiom to convey the sense that this is referring to what God regards or considers the stone to be. Your language may have an idiom of its own that you could use here. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>chosen by God and precious to him (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>chosen and precious with God</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:4a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural in your language to reorder 2:4a–b.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that you…may be built into a spiritual house (NJB) <em>(NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), which has the support of most English versions and commentators.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you…are being built:</strong> This is a passive clause. The one who is doing the building is God. In some languages it may be necessary to translate this using an active verb and make the subject explicit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> is building you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>you:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>you</em> is emphasized and may also be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>you yourselves (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>like living stones:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>like</em> introduces the role that the believers fill as God is building them into a spiritual temple, the role of <em>living stones</em>. Some other ways to translate this metaphor include:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Keep the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are living stones (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the metaphor as a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You also are like living stones (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>living stones:</strong> Peter said these Christians were <em>living</em> because God had caused them to be born again through his word (1:23) and given them new life through Jesus Christ rising from death (1:3).</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>stones:</strong> Peter described the believers as <em>stones</em> because in that part of the world, people built houses out of <em>stones</em>. Christians were like <em>stones</em> in the sense that God was using them to build a house for himself.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>spiritual:</strong> In this context the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>spiritual</em> means “non-material” or “not physical.” It refers to something that cannot be seen by human eyes, something that is in the realm of the divine rather than the human.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>house:</strong> There are two ways of interpreting the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>house</em> here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <em>house</em>, a building where people live. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And now you are living stones that are being used to build a spiritual house. (CEV) <em>(BSB, CEV, GW, KJV, NASB, NET, NIV, NJB, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>temple</u>, a building where people worship God.

These are two metaphors describing the Christian church, made up of all believers.</p></li><li><p>The spiritual house in 2:5a is for the <u>purpose</u> of the <em>holy priesthood</em> offering spiritual sacrifices to God (2:5c).</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways this has been translated include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and form a holy priesthood (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as a holy priesthood (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for a holy priesthood</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You are also a group of holy priests (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>holy priesthood:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>priesthood</em> occurs only twice in the New Testament, both in this chapter (2:5, 2:9). It refers to God’s people as a whole. God made the believers as a group into an order of holy priests. Priests are people who approach God to worship him and offer sacrifices.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In your translation, try to make it clear that Peter was referring to the believers as a group, not as individuals. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a <u>group</u> of holy priests (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>holy:</strong> In this context, the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>holy</em> refers to someone who is set apart to serve God. God has set the members of this priesthood apart to serve him. He has dedicated them to himself. Some other examples for translating are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>dedicated to God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>fully serving God</p></blockquote><h4>2:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>offering spiritual sacrifices</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and to offer spiritual sacrifices <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of thanks and praise to God</span></p></li><li><p>in order for you to offer <span data-bnType=\"implied\">him</span> spiritual sacrifices <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of worship</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>offering spiritual sacrifices:</strong> The priesthood of believers that Peter wrote about is similar to the Hebrew Old Testament priesthood in that both presented offerings to God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>spiritual:</strong> As in 2:5a, the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>spiritual</em> means “non-material.” Peter’s readers were not offering animals as sacrifices. They were offering sacrifices that could not be seen.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sacrifices:</strong> In this context, the word <em>sacrifices</em> is a metaphor. Peter was not really talking about animal <em>sacrifices</em> such as the Hebrew priests offered to God during the Old Testament period.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A word of caution: Substituting “gifts” for “sacrifices” might result in inadvertent confusion with “spiritual gifts.” If a language has a word such as “offerings” and it would be unambiguous that the giving is from man to God, that would probably be preferable to using a word that functions as “gifts” does in English.</span></span> Instead, he was referring to giving praises to God and help to those in need. See also Romans 12:1 and Hebrews 13:15–16.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:5b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">2:5b–c gives the purpose for which God builds the believers into a spiritual house. English translations mark this purpose in three different places:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Before the mention of the holy priesthood. For example, the BSB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>to be</u> a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices (BSB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Before the mention of the spiritual sacrifices. For example, the NJB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as a holy priesthood <u>to</u> offer the spiritual sacrifices (NJB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>At both places. For example, the RSV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>to be</u> a holy priesthood, <u>to</u> offer spiritual sacrifices (RSV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">In your translation, mark the purpose at the place where it is most natural in your language.</p></div><h4>2:5d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:5d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>that God accepts through Jesus Christ.</p></li><li><p>These sacrifices please God because of what Jesus Christ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">has done</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>acceptable to God:</strong> The phrase <em>acceptable to God</em> means that God was pleased with the spiritual sacrifices that the believers offered to him. Other ways to say this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God accepts your sacrifices</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>These sacrifices please God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>through Jesus Christ:</strong> There are two ways of understanding the relationship of the phrase <em>through Jesus Christ</em> to the rest of 2:5c:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Through Jesus Christ, the spiritual offerings were <u>acceptable</u> to God. God was pleased to receive these offerings because of what Jesus Christ had done. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to offer the spiritual sacrifices made acceptable to God through Jesus Christ (NJB) <em>(BSB, NIV, KJV, NASB, RSV, REB, NET, GW, NLT, NCV, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The believers <u>offered</u> spiritual sacrifices through Jesus Christ. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>with the help of Jesus Christ you will offer sacrifices that please God (CEV) <em>(GNT, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) and the majority of English versions.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:4–5</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In the BSB, as in the Greek, 2:4–5 forms one long sentence. In many languages it may be natural to use several shorter sentences. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You are coming to Jesus Christ, the living stone. He is the one whom people rejected but God considers valuable and chose. You are also living stones, and God is building you into a spiritual house. As a holy priesthood you offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</p></blockquote></div>",

He had used the metaphor of a “stone” to tell about Jesus Christ long before Peter used this metaphor (2:4).</p><h4>2:6a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:6a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For it stands in Scripture:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For/As Scripture says:</p></li><li><p>That is why in the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Holy</span> Writings <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> said:</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For it stands in Scripture:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>For</em> here introduces a verse of Scripture that supports what Peter just wrote. You should introduce this Old Testament quote in a way that is natural for you language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>it stands:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>it stands</em> is literally “it is contained,” as in the NASB. You may also be able to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>For you will find in scripture: (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Isaiah 28:16 quotes God as the speaker. Therefore, you may want to include a reference to God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It is just as God says in the Scriptures… (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Your language may require you to say who wrote the prophecy and whose words he wrote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The prophet Isaiah wrote</span> in the Scriptures <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s talk/words</span> that said this <span data-bnType=\"implied\">would happen</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in Scripture:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Scripture</em> is used in a special way in the New Testament. It refers to words that God directed someone to write. Such writings had authority because God guided a person to write them. In the New Testament the word <em>Scripture</em> almost always refers to something that was written in the Old Testament.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Scripture from which Peter was quoting is Isaiah 28:16 in the Old Testament. You may translate <em>Scripture</em> with the term you use for the Old Testament. If you have a more specific term for the writings of the Old Testament prophets, you may use it here. Some ways to translate the phrase <em>in Scripture</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s written word</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the message of God that they/someone wrote</p></blockquote><h4>2:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“See, I lay in Zion a stone,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“See, I <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the Lord</span> am laying a stone in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the city of</span> Zion.</p></li><li><p>“Listen, I am placing/setting in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the city of</span> Zion a stone</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>See:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>See</em> is the first word of Peter’s quotation of Isaiah 28:16. Its purpose is to catch the attention of the reader. Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Look (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Behold (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Listen to this</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions have not translated this Greek word (GW, NCV, NLT, REB, GNT).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I lay…a stone:</strong> This is a metaphor. God was speaking as though he were a house builder. He said that he was placing a stone into its correct position in a building. Other ways to say this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am placing/setting a stone in position</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am putting a stone into place</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek verb is a present tense verb. However, because it is a prophecy concerning Jesus Christ, it may be more natural to translate it as future tense. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will put a stone in the ground (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a stone:</strong> Peter continued with the metaphor of <em>a stone</em> representing Jesus Christ. See 2:4a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in Zion:</strong> <em>Zion</em> is another name for Jerusalem. Sometimes <em>Zion</em> and Jerusalem are used as metaphors to refer to God’s people everywhere, on earth and in heaven. Here Peter used it to refer to the Christian church, believers in Jesus Christ who live on earth or in heaven. Some English versions such as the NLT translate <em>Zion</em> as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jerusalem (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>2:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>a chosen and precious cornerstone;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This is the stone I have</span> chosen to be the cornerstone, and it is valuable/precious.</p></li><li><p>of great worth <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that I have</span> chosen to be the main foundation stone <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of my house</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>chosen:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Greek word that is translated by most English versions as “chosen” can also be translated as an adjective with the meaning of “excellent” or “select” or “choice.” This is true at 2:4, but especially at 2:6. (See the Bauer, Arndt, Gingrich, and Danker Lexicon, <em>eklektos</em>). This may have been why the NCV at 2:6 has “this important and precious rock.”</span></span> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>chosen</em> is the same as at 2:4b. At 2:4b Peter made it explicit that it was God who chose this stone. Here at 2:6b, God is speaking. If you must make explicit who chose this stone, then here you may be able to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>chosen <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by me</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span> chose <span data-bnType=\"implied\">this stone</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>precious:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>precious</em> is the same as at 2:4b. You will probably want to translate it here the same way as you did at 2:4b. Other ways that the English versions have translated this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>valuable (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>priceless (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>of great worth (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>cornerstone:</strong> A <em>cornerstone</em> was a very hard stone that builders carefully shaped to lay at the corner of a foundation. Because the walls would meet at the <em>cornerstone</em> and rest on top of it, the <em>cornerstone</em> was both a pattern and support for the building.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the metaphor, Peter is speaking about the <em>cornerstone</em> of a “spiritual house” made up of living stones, Christian believers (2:5a). This metaphor represents or illustrates how God appointed Jesus Christ to support and unite the church, the fellowship of all believers. However, you will probably want to retain the metaphor in this quotation, if the grammar of your language allows you to do so naturally.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages there may not be a specific word for a <em>cornerstone</em>. If that is the case in your language, some other ways to translate <em>cornerstone</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the most important stone</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>foundation stone</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>rock (NCV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:6b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In your translation of 2:6b–c, it may be more natural in your language to refer only once to the stone. Instead of saying both “stone” and “cornerstone,” several English versions mention just the cornerstone. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am laying a chosen and precious cornerstone in Zion (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am laying in Zion a chosen corner-stone of great worth (REB)</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:6d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:6d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and the one who believes in Him will never be put to shame.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Whoever trusts/believes in him will never be ashamed.”</p></li><li><p>No one who relies on him will be disgraced.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and the one who believes in Him will never be put to shame:</strong> Peter chose this quotation from Isaiah 28:16 to encourage his readers to remain faithful to Jesus Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It may be more natural in your language to translate 2:6d as a separate sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Anyone who trusts in him will never be disappointed. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the one who believes in Him:</strong> The phrase <em>the one who believes in him</em> refers to anyone and everyone who trusts in Jesus Christ, the cornerstone. Some other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>Anyone</u> who trusts (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>whoever</u> believes (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>Every person</u> who trusts</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>believes:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>believes</em> can also be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>trusts (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>has faith (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>relies (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>in Him:</strong> There are two ways of interpreting the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>in him</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is masculine. The writer was no longer using a metaphor. He was referring directly to <u>Jesus Christ</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whoever believes in <u>him</u> (GNT) <em>(BSB GW, KJV, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, NLT, RSV, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is neuter. The writer was still using <u>the cornerstone</u> metaphor and was referring to this stone. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who relies on <u>this</u> (NJB) <em>(REB, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The CEV is ambiguous (“that one”). It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) as most English versions do.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>will never be put to shame:</strong> There are two ways of interpreting the verb phrase that the BSB translates as <em>will never be put to shame</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The believers will never be <u>ashamed</u> or <u>disgraced</u> for trusting in Jesus Christ as Savior. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>will never be ashamed (GW) <em>(BSB, NET, NIV, NJB, RSV, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The believers will never be <u>disappointed</u>. Jesus Christ will show himself worthy of their trust in him. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>will never be disappointed (GNT) <em>(CEV, NASB, NCV, NLT, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) if you can do so naturally in your language. It is good to use a word that is the opposite of “honor.” Believers will receive not shame but honor from God.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>never:</strong> The two Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>never</em> are two different negative particles/markers. By using them together, Peter said emphatically that his readers would definitely not be ashamed for being Christians.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to state this verse part is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>No one who has faith in him will be disappointed</p></blockquote>",

Christians belong to him and so should live holy lives.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Live as God’s Chosen People (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A Living Stone and a Holy People (CEV)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1061002004\" data-endVerseId=\"1061002008\"><h3>Paragraph 2:4–8</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, Peter used a metaphor that compared Jesus Christ to a stone. He quoted three passages from the Old Testament that also used the metaphor of a stone to speak about the Christ whom God had promised to send:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>In 2:6 Peter quoted from Isaiah 28:16.</p></li><li><p>In 2:7 Peter quoted from Psalm 118:22.</p></li><li><p>In 2:8 Peter quoted from Isaiah 8:14.</p></li></ol></div><h4>2:7–8</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:7–8, Peter continued to use the metaphor of a cornerstone for Jesus Christ. He contrasted the positive result for any person who believes in Jesus Christ (2:7a) with the negative result for people who do not believe (2:7b–2:8). To prove his point, Peter quotes from two OT passages, Psalm 118:22 (in 2:7) and Isaiah 8:14 (in 2:8).</p><h4>2:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>To you who believe, then, this stone is precious.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>So for you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> who trust/believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in this stone</span>, it brings honor <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to you</span>.</p></li><li><p>Therefore <span data-bnType=\"implied\">this stone</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will give</span> honor to you who rely on him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>To you who believe, then, this stone is precious:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>precious</em> can mean either “honor” or “value/worth/preciousness.” The Greek literally says, “to you therefore the honor/value to the believing ones.” English versions interpret this clause in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Believers receive <u>honor</u> from the stone. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>To you believers it brings honor (NJB) <em>(GW, NJB, NRSV, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The stone has <u>value</u> to the believers. It is <em>precious</em> to them. Translations that follow this interpretation often supply the words <em>this stone</em>, which are not in the Greek text. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This stone is of great value for you that believe (GNT) <em>(BSB, CEV, KJV, NCV, NET, NIV, NLT, REB, RSV, GNT, NABRE, NASB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). The great majority of commentators<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See, for example, Bigg, page 131; Michaels, page 104; Selwyn, page 164; Kistemaker, page 89; Marshall, page 72; Grudem, page 104; and Kelly, page 93.</span></span> understand this word to mean “honor” in this context. Peter was saying that God honors those who believe in Jesus Christ. The NJB is therefore used as the Source Line in the Display. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This honor, then, is for you who believe (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This honor belongs to those who believe. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So the honor is for you who believe (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>believe:</strong> In some languages it may be necessary to make the object of the belief explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in this stone</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>then:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>then</em> is literally “therefore.” It is not a time word but connects this sentence with the last part of the quotation in 2:6. Some English models to follow include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Therefore (RSV)</p></blockquote><h4>2:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But to those who do not believe,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But as for those <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> who do not trust/believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in him</span>,</p></li><li><p>However, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the result will be different</span> for <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> who will not rely <span data-bnType=\"implied\">on him</span>, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But to those who do not believe:</strong> In 2:7b Peter stopped writing about believers and started writing about people who did <em>not believe</em> in Jesus Christ. Through the end of 2:8, Peter discussed what happens to unbelieving people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate this verse part include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But for unbelievers (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but for those who have no faith (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But to/for the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> who do not believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in him</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>But:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>But</em> in this context marks contrast. Peter contrasted the bad result of unbelief (2:7b–8) with what he had just written about the good result for those people who believed in Jesus Christ (2:6c–7a).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>believe:</strong> In some languages it may be necessary to make the object of the belief explicit. If that is the case in your language, it is recommended that you use the same pronoun that you used in 2:6d:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in him</span></p></blockquote><h4>2:7c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:7c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the Scripture says:</span> “The stone <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that</span> the builders rejected has become the cornerstone <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the house</span>.”</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God has said in the Holy Writings:</span> “The stone that is now the main foundation stone <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of my house</span> is the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">same</span> stone that the builders discarded.”</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">says in the Psalms:</span> “The builders refused to use a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">certain</span> stone, but <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I have used</span> it as the most important stone <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the building</span>.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Here in 2:7c, Peter quoted from Psalm 118:22.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The stone the builders rejected:</strong> Peter continued using the metaphor of a <em>stone</em> to represent Jesus Christ. Here the metaphor is of <em>builders</em> who <em>rejected</em> this <em>stone</em> as if it were unfit for them to use. It may be more natural in your language to make explicit why they <em>rejected</em> the <em>stone</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The stone which the builders rejected as worthless (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Your translation should not imply that <em>The stone</em> was actually unfit for use. Peter did not mean there was something wrong with Christ. Instead, Peter meant that there was something wrong with the decision of <em>the builders</em>. You may be able to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The builders would not use a certain stone</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The stone that the builders refused to use</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the builders:</strong> Writers of the Gospels also quoted Psalm 118:22. They too used it as a metaphor concerning Jesus Christ. In their writings, <em>the builders</em> represented the religious leaders of the Jews (see Matthew 21:42, Mark 12:10, Luke 20:17). In Acts 4:11, Peter himself spoke of the Jewish authorities who had Christ killed as <em>the builders</em>. In this context, however, <em>the builders</em> refers to anyone who rejected Jesus Christ. Some other ways to translate <em>builders</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>workmen</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who make houses</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>rejected:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>rejected</em> is in the past tense. The Old Testament prophets often wrote about a future event as if it had already happened.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">When you translate this verb, you should use a tense that is natural for this situation in your language. For some languages, it is natural to use a future tense. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will reject</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">A form of this same Greek verb is found at 2:4b. See the note at 2:4b for other ways to translate this verb.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>has become the cornerstone:</strong> Peter continued the metaphor of the stone. Even though the builders rejected this stone, it became <em>the</em> most important stone.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Neither Peter nor Psalm 118:22 that Peter quoted said how the rejected stone became so important in the building. If your language requires you to specify an agent, then you may make God explicit as the agent. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has made it the capstone</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> used it as the cornerstone <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of his house</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If it is natural in your language to translate 2:7c as a continuation of God talking in 2:6, then you may be able to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span> made it the cornerstone</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span> used it as the cornerstone <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the building</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the cornerstone:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>cornerstone</em> may be translated literally as “the head of the corner.” There are two ways of interpreting this phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “the <u>cornerstone</u>.” A cornerstone is a bottom stone where two walls meet. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the cornerstone (NCV) <em>(BSB, GW, NASB, NET, NJB, NLT, REB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “<u>the capstone</u>.” A capstone is the top stone of a wall or arch. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the capstone (NIV) <em>(NIV, compare RSV “the head of the corner”)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) and the majority of English versions. See how you translated “cornerstone” in 2:6b.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:7c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to reorder the phrase in 2:7c. Reordering may also make the transition to the quotation in 2:8 more natural. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The most important stone of all is the one the builders rejected.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The stone that is now the main foundation stone <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of my/the house/temple</span> is the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">same</span> stone that the builders rejected.</p></blockquote></div>",

The collision between unbelievers and this rock results in the downfall of the unbelievers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense:</strong> 2:8b is a quotation from Isaiah 8:14, which was Hebrew poetry. In Hebrew poetry, the writer often repeated the same or similar idea but in different words. Here the same idea is stated twice.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If repeating ideas like this is unnatural in your language and might communicate a wrong meaning, or if your language has only one word for both <em>stone</em> and <em>rock</em>, then you may say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He is a stone/rock that people stumble over so that they fall.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek phrases that the BSB translates as <em>A stone of stumbling</em> and <em>a rock of offense</em> are literally “a stone of stumbling” and “a rock of falling.” The text does not use any verbs. As it is speaking about something that was future to the Old Testament writer, another possible translation model is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This is the stone that will make people stumble, the rock that will make them fall. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>stone…rock:</strong> Some scholars see a difference in meaning between the two Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>stone</em> and <em>rock</em>. The word <em>rock</em> may refer to something larger than a <em>stone</em>. It could mean bedrock or a boulder or rocky crag.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you follow the style of Hebrew poetry to translate 2:8b, you will need two words such as <em>stone</em> and <em>rock</em>. For the first, you will want a word that can mean a <em>stone</em> people might use for building, perhaps cut or shaped to size. For the second, you may use a word that can mean a <em>rock</em> that is relatively larger than the building stone.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>of offense:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>of offense</em> can also be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to trip people up (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to trip over (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Consider the most natural way to express this in your language.</p><h4>2:8c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:8c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>They stumble because they disobey the word—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">These people</span> stumble because they do not obey the message <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from God</span>.</p></li><li><p>The reason that people stumble <span data-bnType=\"implied\">on this stone</span> is because they refuse to obey <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> message/word.</p></li><li><p>It is because they disobey <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God by refusing to believe</span> the message/word <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about Jesus Christ</span> that they stumble.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>They:</strong> <em>They</em> is a pronoun that Peter is using to refer to the people whom he mentioned at 2:7a. <em>They</em> were the people who did not trust/believe in Jesus Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>stumble:</strong> In 2:8b, Peter used the word “stumbling,” which is noun form of the Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>stumble</em> here. Some English versions translate the verb here as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>trip (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they disobey the word:</strong> There are two ways of understanding the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>disobey</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>disobey</u>. These people do not obey the word/message. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they do not obey what God says (NCV) <em>(BSB, NASB, CEV, KJV, NET, NIV, RSV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>disbelieve</u>. These people do not believe the word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they refuse to believe the word (REB) <em>(GW, NJB, GNT, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NLT is not listed because it translates both of the options: “they do not listen to God’s word or obey it.”</span></span> However, Peter was probably implying that the disobedience consisted of not believing what God said about Jesus. In some languages it may be natural to make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they disobey <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God by refusing to believe</span> the message <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about Jesus Christ</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the word:</strong> The Greek term that the BSB translates as <em>word</em> had a very broad meaning. It could refer to almost anything that was said. The correct interpretation had to be understood from the context.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are two ways of interpreting the term here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to a word or <em>message</em>, perhaps concerning the Good News about salvation through Jesus Christ. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They stumble because they disobey the message (NIV) <em>(BSB, NIV, CEV, NASB, NCV, NET, NLT, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is another metaphor for Jesus Christ. This is indicated either by capitalizing the “W” of word, and/or by using the pronoun “in.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they do not believe in the Word (NJB) <em>(GNT, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommend that you follow interpretation (1) as most English versions do.</p><h4>2:8d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:8d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and to this they were appointed.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>This then is their fate/destiny.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Therefore,</span> this will certainly happen to them.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God decided/determined that</span> people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who disobey the word/message</span> will/must stumble like this.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and to this they were appointed:</strong> There are two ways of interpreting the phrase <em>to this they were appointed</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The unbelievers <em>were appointed</em> to stumble because of their disobedience/unbelief.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Another way to say this is: As a consequence of their disobedience to the word, the destiny of unbelievers is to stumble/fall. This is what God has in store for unbelievers in general, and for the individual unbeliever whose attitude and actions were known to God from the beginning.</span></span> In other words, God planned or decided that the people who disobeyed the word would stumble. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They stumble because they do not obey what God says, which is what God planned to happen to them. (NCV) <em>(NJB, NLT, GW, NCV; probably NASB, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The unbelievers <em>were destined</em> to disobey/disbelieve the word and therefore to stumble. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do. (NET) <em>(probably KJV, RSV, NET, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The BSB, NIV, and GNT leave both possibilities open. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), which has the support of most commentaries.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>they were appointed:</strong> This is a passive clause. If it is more natural in your language to use an active verb, it may be necessary to make the implied subject “God” explicit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> destined them</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> determined/decided would happen to them</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> said this must certainly happen to them</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways that the English versions have translated the Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>they were appointed</em> include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the fate in store for them (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the fate appointed for them (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they were doomed (CEV)</p></blockquote>",

Believers are not literally one race, but they are spiritually brothers and sisters, in that God is their heavenly Father.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Many English versions have translated <em>people</em> as “race.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a chosen race (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>chosen:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates here as <em>chosen</em><span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Peter used a form of <em>eklektos</em> in 1:1, but the context is different.</span></span> is also found at 2:4b and 2:6c. It is a passive verb. If in your language you must use an active verb and say who did the choosing, then you may make it explicit that it is God who chooses his <em>people</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But you are God’s chosen…people.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the King’s priests (GNT) <em>(BSB, GW, NCV, CEV, KJV, NASB, NET, NIV, REB, RSV, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>a <u>noun</u>, meaning kingdom. The believers are priests who together form a nation ruled by a king. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a kingdom of priests (NJB) <em>(NLT, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) as most English versions do. The <em>priesthood</em> is <em>royal</em> in the sense that it belongs to or serves the king, who is God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>priesthood:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates here as <em>priesthood</em> occurs in only one other place in the New Testament, at 2:5b. See how you translated it there. It is recommended that you also translate it here in a way that shows that the believers together form a <em>priesthood</em>.</p><h4>2:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>a holy nation,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You are</span> a holy nation,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You are</span> a nation that God has set apart <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as his own</span>.</p></li><li><p>a nation/people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he</span> dedicated <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to serve him</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a holy nation:</strong> Peter continued to describe the church in terms borrowed from the Old Testament. Like the people of Israel in the Old Testament, all believers in Christ together form <em>a holy nation</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>holy:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>holy</em> here means “set apart for God” or “dedicated to God.” God chose believers to be in fellowship with him, dedicated to serve him willingly. See how you translated <em>holy</em> in 1:15 and 1:16. Here is another way to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>dedicated (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>nation:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>nation</em> is different from the one translated as “people” or “race” in 2:9a. However, these two Greek words had a similar meaning. A <em>nation</em> was a group of people linked or united by language or culture or race.</p><h4>2:9d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>a people for God’s own possession,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>a people that belongs to God.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You are</span> God’s <span data-bnType=\"implied\">very</span> own people.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">to</span> belong <span data-bnType=\"implied\">just/only</span> to God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a people for God’s own possession:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>a people for God’s own possession</em> is literally “a people for possession.” The BSB has supplied the word <em>God</em> in order to make the meaning clear. Some English translations simply supply the pronoun “his”:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a people of his own (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a people:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>a people</em> is similar in meaning to the words translated as “people” in 2:9a and “nation” in 2:9c. You should use the word in your language that is most accurate and natural, even if it is one of the words that you have already used in this verse.</p><h4>2:9e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to proclaim the virtues of Him</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He/God did this</span> so that you would tell <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other people</span> about the wonderful things he did <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for you</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He/God chose you to be his people</span> so that you would make known his great deeds/acts.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>to</em> introduces the purpose for which God chose Christians to be his own holy people. Some ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in order that… (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You were chosen to… (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that… (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>proclaim the virtues of Him:</strong> God chose the believers and made of them a priesthood and holy nation for a purpose. He intended them to tell other people the wonderful things that God has done.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>proclaim:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>proclaim</em> can also be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>make known</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>declare (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>tell (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Your language may require you to say to whom the believers were to make these things known.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the wonderful acts of God (GNT) <em>(CEV, NCV, RSV, REB, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to the virtues or excellencies of God, the <u>attributes of God</u>.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the praises of God (NJB) <em>(KJV, NIV, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), which has the support of leading commentaries.</p><h4>2:9f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He called/brought you out of the dark to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">live in</span> his wonderful/marvellous light.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You are to tell others about how</span> he summoned/led you out of the darkness <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of sin and death and</span> into his amazing light/brightness.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light:</strong> Peter was referring to God. God is the one <em>who called</em> Peter’s readers <em>out of darkness</em> and <em>into…light</em>. This is one of the wonderful deeds for which Peter’s readers were to praise him. In some languages it may be natural to make this explicit. You may want to begin a new sentence here:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">For God</span> called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>called:</strong> If in your language a verb like <em>called</em> is unnatural in this context, then you may be able to say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>brought (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>summoned</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>led</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>darkness:</strong> Here, <em>darkness</em> is a metaphor representing the miserable condition of unbelievers because of their sinfulness. Peter’s readers were in that <em>darkness</em> before they became reconciled to God through Jesus Christ. By believing in Jesus Christ as their Savior, they moved out of the <em>darkness</em> of sin and into the <em>light</em> of God. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">spiritual</span> darkness</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>marvelous:</strong> Other ways to translate the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>marvelous</em> include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wonderful (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>amazing (JBP)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>light:</strong> Here, <em>light</em> is a metaphor for the goodness, purity and truth that come from God.

For example, the JBP shows this by making explicit that they are “his”:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But you are <u>God’s</u> “chosen generation,” <u>his</u> “royal priesthood,” <u>his</u> “holy nation,” <u>his</u> “peculiar people”…. It is for you now to demonstrate the goodness of him who has called you out of darkness into his amazing light. (Underlining added.)</p></blockquote></div>",

Christ was like the most important stone in a building. Christians belong to him and so should live holy lives.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Live as God’s Chosen People (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A Living Stone and a Holy People (CEV)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1061002009\" data-endVerseId=\"1061002010\"><h3>Paragraph 2:9–10</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, Peter described the honorable status that God had given his readers. He used titles that OT writers had used to speak of the people of Israel.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For examples, see Exodus 19:5–6; 23:22 (LXX); Deuteronomy 4:20, 7:6, 14:2; Isaiah 43:20–21.</span></span> Many of Peter’s readers were not Jews. Peter meant that all believers, whether Jew or Gentile, are now united as God’s chosen people.</p></div><h4>2:10</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In this verse,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For background to this verse, see Hosea 1:6, 9 and 2:1, 23.</span></span> Peter continued identifying his Christian readers as God’s people. Here he referred to the description of the children of Israel from Hosea 2:23 to describe believers in Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Most English versions do not mark this verse as a quotation. The NLT and CEV, however, place this verse in quotation marks. The CEV identifies it (at the end of 2:9) as being from the Scriptures by saying:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Scriptures say… (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Introduce this verse in a way that sounds natural in your language. You may wish to note in a footnote that it is taken from Hosea 2:23. It is not a direct quotation.</p><h4>2:10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Formerly, you were not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">even</span> a people, but now you are God’s <span data-bnType=\"implied\">own</span> people.</p></li><li><p>In the past, you did not belong together as a people group. Now you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">belong</span> to the people of God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Once:</strong> The word <em>Once</em> refers to the time period before these Gentile believers became part of the group identified as God’s people. Other ways to say this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In the past</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>At one time (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not a people:</strong> This phrase has been interpreted in different ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Before they became believers, Peter’s readers had no common identity. They were not a community, a distinct people group. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you were not a people at all (REB) <em>(BSB, KJV, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, NLT, RSV, CEV, NJB, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Before they became believers, Peter’s readers were not God’s people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you were not God’s people (GNT) <em>(GW, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) as most English versions do.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>people:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>people</em> twice in this verse is the same word as at 2:9d. These are the only places in this letter where Peter used this Greek word.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This word referred to a distinct group of related <em>people</em>. It could refer to an ethnic group, such as the Old Testament <em>people</em> of Israel.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>but</em> introduces a contrast between the past and the present. Express this contrast in a way that is natural for your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>now:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>now</em> in this context means “ever since you became Christians.” It refers to the state of things at the time when Peter was writing.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you are the people of God:</strong> Peter said that his readers had become a people, a community, and that they as a community belonged to God.</p><h4>2:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Then, you did not have <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> mercy, but now you have it.</p></li><li><p>In the past, you had not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">experienced</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> kindness <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to you</span>.

Before God demonstrated that Gentiles, as well as Jews, could be his people, these Gentile Christians <em>had not</em> experienced God’s <em>mercy</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may not be possible to translate <em>mercy</em> as an abstract noun. Instead you may need to use an adjective or verb and make the subject God explicit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> had not been merciful to you…has been merciful to you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> had not forgiven you…has forgiven you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>had not received mercy:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates here as <em>had not received mercy</em> is a perfect tense verb. You may be able to translate this to show that this was an ongoing state or condition in the past. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In the past you had never received mercy (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In the past you had no experience of his mercy (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Once you were outside his mercy (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>but</em> again introduces a contrast between the past and the present.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>now you have received mercy:</strong> Peter knew that his readers had at some time in the recent past received mercy from God. Now they were living as forgiven people, people who had received mercy.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>mercy:</strong> The word <em>mercy</em> means compassion for those who suffer or are in need. Some other ways this word can be translated include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>pity (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>kindness (CEV)</p></blockquote>",

So, I strongly/earnestly encourage/ask you</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Beloved:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Beloved</em> was a common way for a letter writer to address his readers. It expressed his affection for them. It does not imply that Peter actually knew them personally as individuals. Some other ways <em>Beloved</em> can be translated include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Dear ones</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you whom I love</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>my friends (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I urge you:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>urge</em> means to ask very strongly or to earnestly recommend someone to do something. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I beg you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I beseech you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I appeal to you (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as foreigners and exiles:</strong> Peter reminds his readers again (see 1:1, 1:17) that this world is not their real home, so they are living here as <em>foreigners and exiles</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Commentators agree that in this context <em>foreigners</em> means much the same things as <em>exiles</em>. The two words are used together as a stylistic device to emphasize what Peter is saying. Some English translations therefore combine them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as aliens in a foreign land (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>foreigners:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>foreigners</em> is related to the word that it translates as “foreigners” in 1:17c. It refers to someone who is living temporarily in a country of which he is not a citizen.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>exiles:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>exiles</em> is the same as that in 1:1c. It again refers to someone living in a land that is not his own. See how you translated this word in 1:1c.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways <em>foreigners</em> and <em>exiles</em> can be translated include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>temporary residents and foreigners (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>strangers and refugees (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>aliens and exiles (RSV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:11a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The fact that the believers were foreigners and exiles is the ground for the appeal. So in some languages it may be helpful to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…you are foreigners and strangers on this earth. So I beg you… (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…you are foreigners and aliens here. So I warn you… (NLT)</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to abstain from the desires of the flesh,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to refuse/reject the bad desires/appetites of your human nature.</p></li><li><p>to not do the bad things that you feel like doing,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to abstain from the desires of the flesh:</strong> The word <em>abstain</em> means to hold oneself back from doing something.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">So the phrase <em>to abstain from the desires of the flesh</em> means “not to do things you want to do that are wrong” or “to avoid doing the things that your sinful human nature wants to do.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>from the desires of the flesh:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the desires of the flesh</em> is literally “fleshly desires.” The adjective “fleshly,” that is, “of the flesh,” refers in this context to the human nature that tends towards sin. “Flesh” is here contrasted with the “soul,” which is the immortal and spiritual part of man that desires to do God’s will.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If possible, do not translate “flesh” as “body.” It is true that sinful actions are done with our bodies, but our minds and hearts are involved as well (Mark 7:21).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to say this phrase include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to keep away from fleshly desires (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not to surrender to sinful desires</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>avoid doing the bad things you want to do</p></blockquote><h4>2:11c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:11c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>which war against your soul.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Those bad desires fight/struggle against your spiritual self/life.</p></li><li><p>because those things are your enemies.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>which war against your soul:</strong> This is a figure of speech. Peter was saying that all sinful desires are like enemies that are fighting against the believer’s soul.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your soul:</strong> The <em>soul</em> is the real person/individual, as in 1:9. It is the person who has been rescued for eternal life. This life is threatened by the desires of the unredeemed human nature.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways of saying this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that attack the soul (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that battle your soul</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those desires that fight against you (CEV)</p></blockquote>",

They would watch how the Christians behaved. Peter wanted his readers to behave so well that their unbelieving neighbors would eventually recognize they were good people and praise God for them. Compare the teaching of Jesus in Matthew 5:16.</p><h4>2:12a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:12a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Conduct yourselves with such honor among the Gentiles that,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Let your conduct/behavior among unbelievers be so good/upright that</p></li><li><p>Behave so well as you live among your pagan neighbours that</p></li><li><p>Conduct yourselves righteously in the sight of the people who do not know God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Conduct yourselves with such honor among the Gentiles:</strong> Peter wanted the believers to behave in a way that others could see to be righteous. He was talking about their public, outward behavior. A similar expression is found in 1:17c. Another translation suggestion is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Let your conduct among unbelievers be so good (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Gentiles:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Gentiles</em> was used by the Jews to refer to non-Jews, people who did not worship the one true God. If there is an expression in your language for people who worship false gods, you could use that here. Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>unbelievers (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>unbelieving neighbors (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>non-Christians (NET)</p></blockquote><h4>2:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>though they slander you as evildoers,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>even though they say you are people who do bad things</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">If you do this,</span> even though they make false accusations against you,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>though they slander you as evildoers:</strong> There are two ways of understanding the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>though they slander you as evildoers</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It assumes and asserts that people were making accusations. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when they accuse you of being evildoers (GNT) <em>(BSB, NRSV, NIV, KJV, NASB, NJB, NET, GW, REB, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It suggests that people might make accusations. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Even if they accuse you of doing wrong (NLT) <em>(RSV, CEV, NCV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Peter was assuming that some of the pagans were actually saying that the Christians were doing evil things.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>slander:</strong> Peter was speaking about false accusations. The pagans were saying that the believers had done things that they had not done. In your translation, you may need to make it explicit that these accusations were false. One way to do this is to use a word that means “speak falsely against someone.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>malign (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>falsely accuse</p></blockquote><h4>2:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>they may see your good deeds and glorify God</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>they may <span data-bnType=\"implied\">perhaps</span> see the good things you do, and they may praise God</p></li><li><p>still, when they see your good behavior, they will have to give God honour/praise</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they may see your good deeds and glorify God:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>they may see your good deeds and glorify God</em> is literally “by observing your good deeds they may glorify God.” The purpose for living good lives (2:2a) is that the pagans would glorify God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>see your good deeds:</strong> In some languages it may be natural to translate <em>deeds</em> as a phrase with a verb:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>see the good things you do</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>see you do good things</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>see:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>see</em> means “observe closely.” If you have more than one word for <em>see</em> in your language, choose the one that means to watch someone or something attentively.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and glorify God:</strong> The word <em>glorify</em> means to give glory, praise, and honor to someone or something. In this context, Peter is saying that even unbelievers will give glory/praise to God in the future. Some other ways to translate glorify God are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>praise God (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>give honor to God (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>2:12d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:12d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>on the day He visits us.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>at the time when he will come to us/them.</p></li><li><p>when he comes to judge people.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>on the day He visits us:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>on the day he visits us</em> is literally “on the day of visitation.” The BSB has supplied the information that it was God who was going to visit.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the day:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>the day</em> does not necessarily refer to one specific twenty-four hour day. It likely has the more general meaning of “time” or “occasion.” In some languages it may therefore be best to follow the model of the NET:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when he appears (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>He visits us:</strong> In the Old Testament, the “day of visitation” was a time when God came to people to investigate their conduct. It resulted either in punishment (Isaiah 10:3) or blessing (Genesis 50:24). It is better not to say which it was here. God was going to intervene directly in human affairs. It would be a time of blessing for some and of judgment for others. Some other ways <em>He visits us</em> has been translated include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he judges the world (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Day of his coming (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when he comes to judge (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The BSB has also supplied the pronoun <em>us</em>. It is also possible to translate this as “on the day he visits <u>them</u>.” If you must supply an object pronoun, use one that is as general as possible. Most English translations avoid supplying such a pronoun by using a verb that does not require an object. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>on the day when Christ comes again (NCV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:12</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek, as in the BSB, 2:12 is one long sentence. In some languages it may be natural to translate this as two or more sentences. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12a</sup>You should live righteously among your pagan neighbors. <sup>12b</sup>It is true that they have made false accusations against you. <sup>12c</sup>But when they see the good things you do, they will glorify God <sup>12d</sup>on the day when he appears.</p></blockquote></div>",

They should respect and obey their rulers, including those who ruled locally in the village or town and those who ruled the country. They should also respect and obey the chief ruler of all, the emperor of Rome. God had given these people authority to punish people who do evil and praise those who do good.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Respect the Authority of Others (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Submission to Rulers and Masters (NIV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:13a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:13a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human institution,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Please/Honour the Lord by submitting to all human authorities/rulers,</p></li><li><p>¶ Since you are people of the Lord Jesus Christ, you must obey all people who have authority over you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Submit yourselves…to:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>Submit yourselves…to</em> means to recognize someone else’s authority. It is to accept their legal position and to act respectfully, as a subordinate. This would normally imply obeying their orders. Other translation suggestions include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>accept the authority of (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>place yourself under the authority of (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for the Lord’s sake:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>for the Lord’s sake</em> means “because of the Lord (Jesus Christ).” Peter wanted his readers to act in a way that would both please and honor the Lord.

In some languages it may be necessary to translate <em>God’s will</em> with a verb phrase.

In some languages it may be natural to say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you should do good and so…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>doing good:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>doing good</em> is from the same word that is translated as “those who do right” in 2:14b. The BSB has changed from “right” to <em>good</em> for the sake of variety, in accordance with good English style. In your translation, use the same or a different word according to what is most natural in your language.</p><h4>2:15c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:15c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>you should silence the ignorance of foolish men.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>foolish and ignorant people will stop talking <span data-bnType=\"implied\">against you</span>.</p></li><li><p>should silence those senseless people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who criticise you</span> without knowing the truth.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you should silence the ignorance of foolish men:</strong> The BSB translates the Greek phrase literally here by saying <em>silence the ignorance</em>. The RSV says similarly “you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men.” But in many languages, neither “ignorance” nor “ignorant talk” (NIV, GNT) may be things that can be silenced. It may be more natural to speak of silencing people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>make foolish people stop saying such ignorant things</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>silence foolish and ignorant people</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you should silence:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>you should silence</em> in this context refers to making it morally impossible rather than physically impossible for people to say bad things. The truth should be so obvious that people would be ashamed to keep talking badly about the believers. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you should <u>cause</u> those foolish people <u>to fall silent</u></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you should <u>make it impossible</u> for foolish people <u>to say</u>…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the ignorance:</strong> By <em>ignorance</em>, the BSB is actually referring to speech that is not based on knowledge of the facts. The person who is speaking does not know the truth. So in some languages it may be necessary to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the talk/words of ignorant people</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It is implied that what these people were saying was false and that they were saying bad things about the believers. In some languages it may be necessary to make this explicit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">false</span> things that ignorant people are saying <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about you</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>foolish men:</strong> The word <em>foolish</em> means lacking good sense.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>men:</strong> Here the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>men</em> means people in general and refers to anyone who was speaking evil about believers.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:15a–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reverse the order of verse parts b and c.

It is also possible to supply a word meaning “Act” (as in the NASB). Peter meant that his readers should consider themselves to be free and conduct themselves in a way that is appropriate for free people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>freedom:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>freedom</em> is the opposite of “slavery” and describes the state of “not being under the control of others.” In one sense, this is a metaphor. Many of the believers were, in fact, slaves. But the believers were free inwardly and spiritually. They were free to judge what was right and good. They were free from having to sin and from the pagan customs of their ancestors (see 1:18). Christ had set them free from those things.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Live as free people (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Live as those who are free (REB)</p></blockquote><h4>2:16b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:16b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but being free is not an excuse for doing evil.</p></li><li><p>This means that you should not think that as a result of this you can do evil.</p></li><li><p>Do not try to hide sin under the cloak/guise of freedom.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>but</em> and the RSV as “yet” here introduces a limitation to the previous idea. Some English versions do not translate this conjunction. Introduce this limitation in a way that is natural for your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil:</strong> Peter was concerned that his readers might misunderstand what he had said about being free, He emphasized that being free did not mean that they were free to do wrong.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages <em>freedom</em> may not be something that a person can <em>use</em>. So you may need to translate it in one of these ways:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the fact that you are free is not an excuse for doing evil</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>do not try to cover/veil your sin by saying that you are free</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>cover-up:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>cover-up</em> is literally “cloak.” Here it refers to something that is used to hide something else. Think whether there is an idiomatic expression in your language for a <em>cover-up</em>, that is, something good that is used to hide an evil deed. Other translations include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>pretext (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>excuse (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>2:16c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:16c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>live as servants of God.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Live as people who <span data-bnType=\"implied\">want to</span> serve God.</p></li><li><p>Behave in the way that is fitting for servants of God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>live as servants of God:</strong> Peter was calling on the believers to realize that they must obey God above anyone else. They must try to please him. As in 2:16a, the BSB has supplied the word <em>live</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>servants:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>servants</em> referred to people who were not free to leave their employment. The idea is the opposite of being “in freedom,” as 2:16a says. In some languages it may be most accurate to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>slaves</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:16a–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reverse the order of 2:16b and 16c:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>16a</sup>You are free, <sup>16b</sup>but still you are God’s servants, <sup>16c</sup>and you must not use your freedom as an excuse for doing wrong (CEV)</p></blockquote></div>",

Some versions such as the NIV translate this word as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Slaves (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>submit yourselves:</strong> Peter wanted his believing slaves to choose to respect their masters, as all believers were to respect their rulers. See how you translated this same command in 2:13a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to your masters:</strong> The word <em>masters</em> refers to the owners, the people who had authority over the slaves. They could be either male or female. Here is another way to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>owners (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with all respect:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>all respect</em> means “greatly respect” or “respect very much.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>respect:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>respect</em> is literally “fear.” Peter does not say whom his readers should respect or fear. Scholars suggest two possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>They should respect <u>their masters</u>.

These masters were treating their slaves in a harsh or hard way.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>unreasonable:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>unreasonable</em> literally means “bent, crooked.” In this context it is the opposite of good and considerate and means “unjust, hard to please.” These masters probably often punished their slaves by beating them.

It implies a negative answer, “It is not to your credit at all.” It is really a strong negative statement. There are two ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Translate it as a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What credit do you deserve if you endure a beating for doing something wrong? (GW)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate it as a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If you are beaten for doing wrong, there is no reason to praise you for being patient in your punishment.

You should introduce this in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>How is it to your credit…?:</strong> The phrase <em>how is it to your credit</em> means “what honor do you deserve <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from God</span>…?” Other translation models include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who will praise you…?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>what glory is there…?</p></blockquote><h4>2:20b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:20b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>if you are beaten for doing wrong and you endure it?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>if you do wrong and then endure the punishment <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that your master gives you</span>?</p></li><li><p>in enduring a beating that you well deserve.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if you are beaten for doing wrong and you endure it:</strong> In some languages it may be natural to translate the events in this verse part in the order in which they happen. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if you do wrong and then receive your punishment patiently</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>are beaten:</strong> The phrase <em>you are beaten</em> is a passive verbal phrase. It refers to being punished severely by being hit repeatedly. In some cases the master would beat the servant personally, but in others he would perhaps order another servant to do it. So you could translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">your master</span> punishes you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">your master</span> causes/orders you to be beaten</p></blockquote><h4>2:20c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:20c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But if you do good and he beats you, and you patiently endure it,</p></li><li><p>However if you are patient when your master causes you to suffer for doing good,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>But</em> here introduces an alternative possibility. Translate this conjunction in a way that is natural in your language. An English idiom to express this idea is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>On the other hand (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if you suffer for doing good and you endure it:</strong> In some languages it may be necessary to make explicit that the slave suffers “punishment,” or a beating, as in the previous verse part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if you do nothing but what is right, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and your master still punishes you</span> and you endure <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that punishment</span> patiently</p></blockquote><h4>2:20d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:20d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>this is commendable before God.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>this is praiseworthy in the eyes of God.</p></li><li><p>God considers this good behavior.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>this is commendable before God:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>this is commendable before God</em> is literally “this <span data-bnType=\"implied\">is</span> grace/favor before God.” It means that this kind of suffering pleases God.

In these verses, Peter applied this description of the Messiah to Christ.</p><h4>2:22a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:22a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“He committed no sin,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He did no bad thing at all,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus Christ</span> never sinned</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He committed no sin:</strong> The phrase <em>He committed no sin</em> means that the Messiah did nothing wrong or evil at all. Peter applied this reference to Christ. During his whole life, Jesus never broke God’s law or did anything that displeased God. This is a reference to Isaiah 53:9. Some other ways this phrase has been translated include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He never sinned (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ did not sin (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>2:22b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:22b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and no deceit was found in His mouth.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and he told no lies.</p></li><li><p>and never lied <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to anyone</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>no deceit was found in His mouth:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>no deceit was found in His mouth</em> is an idiom that means “he never deceived anyone” or “he never told a lie.” It continues the reference to Isaiah 53:9 describing the Messiah, which Peter applied to Christ. Some other ways this phrase has been translated are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he was guilty of no falsehood (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and he had never lied (NCV)</p></blockquote>",

The Jewish leaders and Roman soldiers said that Jesus was evil and had said and done evil things. This is literally a passive verbal phrase in Greek, “who, being reviled.” Some other ways to translate this phrase include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When he was insulted (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When people spoke against him</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He did not retaliate:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>retaliate</em> means to strike back against someone either physically or verbally. In this context, it refers to answering in an evil way to someone who has spoken evil about you. An English idiom for this expression is “get even.” Other translation models include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he did not answer back (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he did not insult them in return (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>2:23b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:23b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>when He suffered, He made no threats,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>When they made him suffer, he did not threaten <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to make them suffer</span>.</p></li><li><p>When they abused him, he did not say that he would do evil to them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>when He suffered:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>when He suffered</em> is applied by Peter to the time when Jesus suffered and died on the cross.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> caused him to suffer</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He made no threats:</strong> The phrase <em>He made no threats</em> means that the Messiah did not say that he would harm to the people who were insulting him.

The NIV translates this conjunction as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Instead (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>entrusted Himself to:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>he entrusted</em> means to commit or hand over someone or something to someone else. The Greek text does not have a direct object. The BSB has supplied the word <em>Himself</em>. It is also possible to supply words meaning “his affair” or “what concerned him.” Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>left everything to (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>placed his hopes in (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>left his case in (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Him who judges justly:</strong> The one who judges justly is God.

Another way to translate <em>bore</em> is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>carried (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in His body:</strong> This phrase indicates that it was as a human being that Christ bore our sins.

Some versions (BSB, NIV) put the allusion to Isaiah in quotation marks, even though it is not a direct quotation.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you were like sheep going astray:</strong> This is a metaphor. In this Old Testament quotation, people who do not know God are compared to <em>sheep</em>. Those are domestic animals that are raised for meat and for wool. In some languages there may not be a word for <em>sheep</em>. If that is true in your language, you may borrow the word for sheep and indicate its meaning with a general word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>an <span data-bnType=\"implied\">animal called</span> sheep</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>going astray:</strong> The phrase <em>going astray</em> means to go in the wrong direction or off the correct path/way.

So the REB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you have turned towards</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls:</strong> Peter was referring to Jesus Christ. He was the Shepherd of all who believed on him, and he was their Overseer also.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Shepherd:</strong> A <em>Shepherd</em> is someone who takes care of animals such as sheep and goats. This is a metaphor. Jesus is like a shepherd in the sense that he leads and cares for those who belong to him. Since this is a very important metaphor in both the New and Old Testaments, it is recommended that you translate it literally. See Psalm 23:1 and John 10:11 as additional examples.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Overseer:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Overseer</em> means one who watches over and protects others.

For example, it may be possible to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as many as do not obey the word</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those who do not believe the word</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>refuse to believe the word:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>refuse to believe the word</em> is literally “disobey the word.” Here it means “disobey the message from God by not believing in Jesus.” Peter was referring to men who were not Christians. The verb <em>refuse to believe</em> is the same as in 2:8c (note on “disobey the word”).</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the word:</strong> The phrase <em>the word</em> refers to the word of God and means “the word that comes from God.” If people in your area would not understand that, you may want to include the implied words.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways <em>the word</em> has been translated include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s word (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s teaching (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Good News (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>3:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>they will be won over without words by the behavior of their wives</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>will be won over <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to the faith</span> by your<sup>(fem/plur)</sup> behavior, without any words being spoken.</p></li><li><p>may be persuaded <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to believe in Christ</span> by the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">excellent</span> way their wives behave. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Their wives</span> will not need to preach to them<sup>(masc)</sup>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they will be won over…by the behavior of their wives:</strong> The Greek expression that the BSB translates as <em>they will be won over…by the behavior of their wives</em> is in the passive. In some languages it may be necessary to use an active verb:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the behavior of their wives might win them over</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the way their wives behave will win them</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>won over:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>won over</em> here is a figure of speech. It means “gained for the Lord,” that is, convinced or persuaded to become a Christian. Some other ways to translate this expression are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the figure. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>win these men for Christ (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>win them over to believe (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>persuaded to believe (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>convinced to believe in Christ</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>of their wives:</strong> If you translated 3:1a as a direct command to wives, it may be natural to translate <em>of their wives</em> as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>of you, their wives</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>your<sup>(fem/plur)</sup></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>without words:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>without words</em> here means “without the wife talking to her husband about Jesus.” It does not mean that the wife refuses to talk to her husband, or that she never even tells him that she is a Christian. It means that the way she acts should be so attractive to her husband that she will not need to keep on speaking to him about Jesus. Some other ways to translate this phrase include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>without saying anything (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It will not be necessary for you to say a word (GNT)</p></blockquote>",

You should introduce and connect it to 3:1 in a way that is natural in your language. In some languages it may be more natural to begin a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your husbands will see… (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>when they see:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>when they see</em> is literally “seeing.” In this context it is equivalent to “because they see” (as in the GNT). The Greek verb is the same as in 2:12c and means to observe closely.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>your pure and reverent demeanor:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>your pure and reverent demeanor</em> is more literally “your pure way of life in fear.” The phrase “in fear” refers to fearing God. In some languages it may be natural to translate the phrase “in fear” as an adjective, as the BSB has done. Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in what a pure and reverent way you live</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>how pure and reverent are your lives</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>how pure and reverent your conduct is (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>pure:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>pure</em> refers to holy and chaste behavior. Another way to translate <em>pure</em> is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sincere</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>reverent:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>reverent</em> is literally “fear.” It is the same as in 2:18a (note on “respect”). There are two ways of understanding this word in this context:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to <u>reverence for God</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your respect for God (NCV) <em>(BSB, NIV, RSV, NJB, CEV, NET, NLT, GNT, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to <u>respect for the husband</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>respectful behavior (NASB) <em>(NASB, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The KJV does not indicate whom the women were to fear. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This interpretation is implied by the use of the word <em>reverence</em> in the majority of English versions.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:1c–3:2</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reorder the clauses of 3:1c and 3:2 in this way:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1c</sup>Even though you do not speak about Christ to them, <sup>2</sup>they will see that you behave in a way that is holy and pious/reverential. <sup>1c</sup>Then they will turn and believe in him.</p></blockquote></div>",

Peter did not want them <u>to spend an excessive amount of money</u> in order to try to make themselves beautiful by decorating their bodies. Different ways to say this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Let your beauty not be external (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not adorn yourselves outwardly (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>outward adornment:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>outward adornment</em> refers to all of the ways people try to make their bodies beautiful.

If in your area women normally braid their hair, you will need to choose an expression that refers to elaborate or fancy braiding. Some other ways to translate <em>braided hair</em> include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>fancy hairstyles (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the way you fix your hair (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>gold jewelry:</strong> The word <em>gold</em> refers to a very valuable metal that is strong and beautiful.

Peter was forbidding women from trying to make themselves look beautiful by wearing expensive or immodest clothes. Other ways to translate <em>fine clothes</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>beautiful clothes (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>expensive clothes (CEV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:3</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to combine 3:3a and 3:3b by following one of these models:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is not fancy hair, gold jewelry or fine clothes that should make you beautiful.

In this verse Peter says where true beauty comes from. Introduce this contrast in a way that is natural for your language. Here is another way to translate this transition:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Rather (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>from the inner disposition of your heart:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>from the inner disposition of your heart</em> continues the thought from the previous verse. Some translations make this explicit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No, your beauty should come from within you (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the inner disposition of your heart:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the inner disposition of your heart</em> is literally “the hidden person of the heart.” It refers to a woman’s character—what she is like on the inside. This true nature is revealed in a person’s attitudes and behavior.</p><h4>3:4b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:4b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>A gentle and quiet spirit will give you a beauty that does not fade/diminish</p></li><li><p>Kindness and tranquillity will make you beautiful all your life,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit:</strong> The phrase <em>the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit</em> means “that unfading beauty which consists in a gentle and quiet spirit.” Peter was saying that to possess a virtuous character is to possess true beauty.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>unfading beauty:</strong> The phrase <em>unfading beauty</em> means “a beauty that will not diminish.” As a woman gets older, the beauty of her body may lessen, but the beauty of her spirit and character will not lessen. See the notes on 1:4b, where the Greek word for <em>unfading</em> is translated as “can never…fade.” Some other ways to translate <em>unfading beauty</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This kind of beauty will last… (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>beauty…that can’t be destroyed (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may not be possible to use an abstract noun such as “beauty.” Another possibility is to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a gentle and quiet spirit that will always remain beautiful</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>gentle:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>gentle</em> means humble, not demanding one’s way, not pushy or selfishly assertive. Some other ways to translate this word include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>kind</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>humble</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>quiet:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>quiet</em> means calm, peaceful, patient.

Here is another way to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>tranquil (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>spirit:</strong> This Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>spirit</em> here refers to the character, nature, or disposition of a person. Peter was talking about a woman’s thoughts and attitude.

If using a comparison with “like” or “as” might suggest in your language that Sarah was not one of these holy women, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Sarah was <span data-bnType=\"implied\">an example of</span> one of these</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Sarah obeyed Abraham:</strong> In some languages it may be necessary to make it explicit that Sarah was Abraham’s wife or that Abraham was Sarah’s husband. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Sarah, who obeyed her husband Abraham</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Sarah, the wife of Abraham, who obeyed him</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>called him lord:</strong> This is an allusion to Genesis 18:12. In the Genesis passage, Sarah was speaking about rather than directly to her husband.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>lord</em> was a common title of respect for any person in authority. It did not imply that the speaker was a servant or slave. In your translation, you could:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a word that women in your culture use to speak politely of and to their husbands.</p></li><li><p>Use a general expression such as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>gave honor to her husband when she spoke to/of him</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>3:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And you are her children</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You show yourselves to be like Sarah</p></li><li><p>You are like her obedient daughters</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And you are her children:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>you are her children</em> is literally “you became her children.” The term could refer to descendants, but most of Peter’s readers were probably not physical descendants of Abraham and Sarah (that is, Jews). Peter meant this in a figurative sense: “you became like Sarah in character.” Consider if your readers would understand a literal translation. If not, you may need to say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you have become like her</p></blockquote><h4>3:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>if you do what is right and refuse to give way to fear.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>if you do what is right and do not allow anything/anyone to frighten you.</p></li><li><p>when you do good and do not let others make you afraid.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>refuse to give way to fear:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>refuse to give way to fear</em> is literally “not fearing any terror.” Peter was probably implying that the women should not be afraid of their non-Christian husbands.

The wife should accept her husband’s authority, even if he is not a Christian, and try to influence him to faith in Christ by her good behavior. Husbands also should show honor towards their wives. Peter also said that when both husband and wife are believers, they share equally in the blessings of their new life in Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Wives and Husbands (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Instructions for wives and husbands</p></blockquote></div><h4>3:7</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Husbands…treat your wives…as a delicate vessel:</strong> There are two ways of understanding the structure of this verse:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The phrase “as a delicate vessel” belongs with the command to treat one’s wife with respect/honor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Likewise you husbands, live considerately with your wives, bestowing honor on the woman as the weaker sex, since you are joint heirs of the grace of life…. (RSV) <em>(RSV, NIV, KJV, REB, CEV, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The phrase “as a delicate vessel” belongs with the command to be considerate to one’s wife. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Husbands, in the same way treat your wives with consideration as the weaker partners and show them honor as fellow heirs of the grace of life…. (NET) <em>(BSB, NASB, GNT, NET, GW, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><h4>3:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Husbands, in the same way, treat your wives with consideration</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Husbands, likewise, live with your wives in a wise/thoughtful/good way.</p></li><li><p>¶ You men who are married should also behave wisely/thoughtfully towards your wife.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Husbands:</strong> The term you use to translate <em>Husbands</em> should match the term you used in 3:1a. Peter is now starting to address a different group of people, Christian men who are married.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the same way:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>in the same way</em> is the same word as in 3:1a. It introduces a new subject on the same general theme of treating one another appropriately and with respect. THere is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Likewise (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>treat your wives with consideration:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>treat your wives with consideration</em> is literally “live with [your wives] according to knowledge/understanding.” Peter wanted Christian husbands to be wise in the way they treated their wives and to try to understand them. Other translation models include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you husbands must show understanding in your married life (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If you are a husband, you should be thoughtful of your wife (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your wives:</strong> Each husband was to have only one wife. In some languages it may therefore be natural to use the singular. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>your wife</p></blockquote><h4>3:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>as a delicate vessel, and with honor</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You know that your wives are weaker than you, so honour them,</p></li><li><p>Give your wife honour/respect, because she is not as strong as you are.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as a delicate vessel:</strong> There are two ways of understanding how the phrase <em>as a delicate vessel</em> connects to the command “treat them with respect”:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Husbands were to treat their wives with respect because women are weaker than men. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>since they are weaker than you (NCV) <em>(BSB, NIV, CEV, REB, KJV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Husbands were to treat their wives with respect in spite of the fact that women are weaker than men. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>though she may be the weaker partner (NJB) <em>(NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) and the majority of English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>delicate vessel:</strong> Peter did not say in what way he thought that women were more <em>delicate</em> than men. He was probably thinking of them as being physically weaker and restricted by the social customs of that time.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>vessel:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as “vessel” refers to in this context to being a human being. Some versions do not translate this word, leaving the meaning implied from the context. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>since they are weaker than you (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>she is not as strong <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a person</span> as you are</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with honor:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>with honor</em> is literally “give due honor.” Refer to your translation of 2:17a, where a similar phrase is used. Here in 3:7b Peter used the noun meaning “honor” and a different verb, but the meaning is the same. Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Treat her with honor (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>3:7c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:7c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>as fellow heirs of the gracious gift of life,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because you, with them, are receiving that life which God freely gives <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to his people</span>.</p></li><li><p>Together you will receive <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from God</span> the kind/generous gift of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">eternal</span> life.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as fellow heirs of the gracious gift of life:</strong> Peter was saying that both husband and wife will receive eternal life. God gives this gift to both men and women.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>heirs:</strong> Peter is using <em>heirs</em> in a figurative sense to mean people who are given something by their father. God our Father gives eternal life to all his children, both men and women.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the gracious gift of life:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the gracious gift of life</em> refers to the eternal life that God gives by his grace/kindness.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>she is your equal partner in God’s gift of new life (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>she will share with you the life that God kindly gives</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because they also will receive, together with you, God’s gift of life (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>3:7d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:7d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that your prayers will not be hindered.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Do this</span> in order that nothing will stop you from praying <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span>.</p></li><li><p>If you do not do this, your prayers will not be good <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in God’s eyes</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that your prayers will not be hindered:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>so that your prayers will not be hindered</em> is in the passive.

(NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This will prevent anything from coming in the way of your prayers. (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Peter was saying that God will not answer men’s prayers if they do not treat their wives with kindness and respect. In some languages it may be clearer to express the meaning in a positive way:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that your prayers will be effective</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God may hear</span> your prayers</p></blockquote>",

They should do this because it pleases God, and because that was how Jesus Christ behaved.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Suffering for Doing Right (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Dedicate Your Lives to Jesus (GW)</p></blockquote></div><h4>3:10–12</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In these verses Peter quoted from Psalm 34 to warn his readers not to do evil to anyone who persecuted them. Peter also wanted to assure his readers that God was concerned for them. As this is an exact quotation from Scripture, it will be good to make this clear, either explicitly in the text or in a footnote.</p><h4>3:10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the Scriptures say</span>:</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">In the Book of God it says:</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>For</em> introduces a quotation that supports what Peter had just written. It is not itself part of the quotation. Translate this conjunction in a way that is natural for your language.</p><h4>3:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Whoever would love life and see good days</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“If a person wants to live in contentment and be happy,</p></li><li><p>“People who want to really enjoy their lives</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse part is a quotation of Psalm 34:12.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Whoever would love life and see good days:</strong> The Greek expression that the BSB translates as <em>Whoever would love life and see good days</em> is a doublet.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">A doublet is the occurrence of two words or phrases together that have the same basic meaning. They are often used for emphasis or poetic effects. The two parts of the expression together mean “Whoever wants to enjoy life” or “Whoever wants to be happy/contented.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Consider if it is natural in your language to say the same thing in two ways like this. Most English translations do keep the doublet. Examples include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>A person must do these things to enjoy life and have many happy days (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>If you want a happy life and good days (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>3:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from deceitful speech.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>he must not speak bad things, he must not make evil plots.</p></li><li><p>must not say hurtful things or tell harmful lies.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse part is a quotation of Psalm 34:13.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from deceitful speech:</strong> This verse part is also a doublet. As is common in Hebrew poetry, the second clause restates the first. Together the two clauses mean:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>must not say things that are evil</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Again, most English translations keep the doublet. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He must not say evil things, and he must not tell lies (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>keep his tongue from evil:</strong> In this context the word <em>evil</em> refers to things that are intended to harm others. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>keep from speaking evil (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>stop saying cruel things (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>deceitful speech:</strong> In this context the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>deceitful</em> describes untruthful words that are spoken in order to hurt or take advantage of someone else. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>telling lies (NLT)</p></blockquote>",

Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Be ready at all times to answer anyone who asks you (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Always be ready to answer everyone who asks you (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>3:15c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:15c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who asks you the reason for the hope that is in you.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>who asks you the reason why you have hope/trust <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span>.</p></li><li><p>who asks you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to tell him</span> why you hope/trust <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the reason for the hope that is in you:</strong> In some languages it may be natural to simplify this expression. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>about your hope (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the hope that is in you:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>hope</em> here refers to trusting in Christ for salvation. See how you translated this word in 1:3, 1:13, 1:21 and 3:5. Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>your Christian hope (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In many languages it may be natural to translate <em>hope</em> as a verb:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you are hoping/trusting <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span></p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:15b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reverse the order of 3:15b and 3:15c.

Peter told the believers not to explain their hope in an aggressive or discourteous manner. Translate this conjunction in a way that is natural for your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>respond with gentleness and respect:</strong> The phrase <em>respond with gentleness and respect</em> means “answer gently and respectfully.” Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you must do this in a gentle and respectful way (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>give a kind and respectful answer (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>gentleness:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>gentleness</em> can also be translated as “meekness.” Here it refers to a quiet and humble manner of speaking. See “gentle” in 3:4b. Here is another way to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>courtesy (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>respect:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>respect</em> is literally “fear.” Commentators agree that in this context it refers to fearing God.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See for example, Michaels, page 189; “It is virtually certain…that <em>phobos </em>in v 16 means fear of God.” See also Achtemeier, page 234; Bigg, page 158; Kelly, page 144; Marshall, page 116, who all agree on this point.</span></span> There are at least two ways to translate this word:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a word that implies that God is the object.

The reason is that Christ himself did this. In some languages it may be possible to translate this conjunction as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You see</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Christ also:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>also</em> compares how Christians should suffer to how Christ died. Christ died innocently, as a righteous man, and that is the way Christians should suffer. However, Christians cannot die for sins to bring people to God. Make sure that your translation does not imply this. To avoid this, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use a phrase that does not imply that the two situations are exactly the same. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ himself</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Supply an introductory phrase suggesting a general comparison such as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Think of what happened to Christ</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>suffered:</strong> There is a textual issue here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some Greek texts have <u>died</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>died (GNT) <em>(RSV, NJB, NASB, CEV, NIV, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Some Greek texts have <u>suffered</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>suffered (NRSV) <em>(BSB, KJV, GW, ESV, NCV, NET, NIV11, NLT, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1). This has the strongest support from the ancient Greek manuscripts. The meaning of the two verbs, of course, is very similar. Christ’s suffering led to or resulted in his death.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for sins:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>for sins</em> means here means “because of people’s sins” or “on account of other people’s sins.” Jesus himself had not sinned. Peter and his readers had all sinned, so in some languages it may natural to supply the pronoun “your<sup>(plur)</sup>” or “our”:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for <span data-bnType=\"implied\">your</span><sup>(plur)</sup> sins</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for <span data-bnType=\"implied\">our</span><sup>(incl)</sup> sins<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some ancient Greek manuscripts do read “for your sins” or “for our sins.” This latter reading is followed by the REB, GW, NLT, and CEV.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>once for all:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>once for all</em> here means that Christ suffered only one time, and it was sufficient. (It does not mean “once for the sake of all people.”) Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>once for all time (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>3:18b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:18b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the righteous for the unrighteous,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He was a good/just man, and he died for wicked/unjust people</p></li><li><p>He was a person who did not do any bad thing, and he died on behalf of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span> people who do bad things</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the righteous for the unrighteous:</strong> There is some implied information here. The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the righteous for the unrighteous</em> is a shortened way of saying “<span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ, who is</span> righteous, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">died</span> for the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">sake of other people, who are</span> unrighteous.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>righteous:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>righteous</em> here means “good” or “innocent.” Christ had done nothing for which he deserved to die. See how you translated <em>righteous</em> in 3:12.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>for</em> here means “on behalf of” or “for the sake of.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>on behalf of (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the unrighteous:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>the unrighteous</em> describes all people as sinful and guilty in God’s sight. Some other ways to translate <em>unrighteous</em> include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>guilty people (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Sinners (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Peter’s readers were included among <em>the unrighteous</em>. It may therefore be natural to say here:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">you who are</span> unrighteous</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">you who are</span> guilty</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Before deciding which pronoun to supply, read the following note on the textual difficulty in 3:18c. The pronoun you use in 3:18b should agree with that in 3:18c.</p><h4>3:18c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:18c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to bring you to God.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>in order to lead you to God.</p></li><li><p>so that he could bring you to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a right relationship with</span> God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to bring you to God:</strong> There is a textual issue here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some Greek texts have <u>you</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that he could bring you to God (GW) <em>(BSB, NIV, NRSV, NET, CEV, NCV, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Some Greek texts have <u>us</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that he might bring us to God (RSV) <em>(NJB, KJV, NASB, NLT, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1), which is favored by commentators. Make sure that your choice agrees with any pronoun you have supplied in 3:18b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to bring…to God:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>to bring…to God</em> means to lead someone into God’s presence, to reconcile someone with God. Some other ways this phrase has been translated are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to bring you safely home to God (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in order to lead you to God (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>3:18d–e</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Most of the modern versions start a new sentence here. These verse parts give the way/means by which Christ brought us to God.</p><h4>3:18d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:18d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He was put to death in the body</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This happened through</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> killing his body</p></li><li><p>In the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">realm/sphere of</span> the flesh <span data-bnType=\"implied\">men</span> put him to death</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He was put to death in the body:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>body</em> is literally “flesh.” In this context this word probably refers to the world of physical, material things. People killed Jesus’ physical body made of flesh when they hung him on the cross. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He was put to death physically (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>He was put to death</em> is passive. In some languages it may be necessary to use an active verb:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">People</span> killed Christ’s <span data-bnType=\"implied\">fleshly/ physical</span> body</p></blockquote><h4>3:18e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:18e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but made alive in the Spirit,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but he was brought to life in the spirit (REB)</p></li><li><p>but in the spiritual <span data-bnType=\"implied\">realm/sphere</span> God made him alive.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>made alive in the Spirit:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>by the Spirit</em> can be literally translates as “in/by spirit/Spirit.” There are three ways of understanding this word:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to the spiritual realm, the sphere of spiritual life. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he was made alive spiritually (GNT) <em>(GNT; probably RSV, NASB, REB, NJB, which all refer to “the spirit”)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to the Holy Spirit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he was raised to life in the Spirit (NLT) <em>(BSB, NIV, KJV, NLT, which all capitalize Spirit)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to Christ’s own human spirit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his spirit was made alive (CEV) <em>(GW, CEV, which say “his spirit”)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Peter was probably referring to the sphere of spiritual things, the realm where the Spirit of God works unseen. This is in contrast to the physical world of flesh and material things mentioned in 3:18d.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For a further discussion of this, see Kelly page 151; Michaels page 204; Selwyn pages 196–197.</span></span></p>",

They should do this because it pleases God, and because that was how Jesus Christ behaved.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Suffering for Doing Right (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Dedicate Your Lives to Jesus (GW)</p></blockquote></div><h4>3:19–22</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Verses 19–22 are difficult to understand. For more details of the debates, see the UBS Translator’s Handbook on 1 Peter. There is also a fairly long discussion in KBT on Translators Workplace, in the article on <u>Spirit, sense A1(d)</u>. Because the interpretation of these verses is uncertain, it is best to translate them literally. Supply as little implied information as possible.</p><h4>3:19</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:19\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in whom He also went and preached to the spirits in prison</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and in this way he went to the spirits who were guarded/imprisoned and preached to them.</p></li><li><p>In this spiritual realm/sphere <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ</span> went and declared/announced <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his victory</span> to the spirits whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> was restricting/restraining.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in whom:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>in whom</em> can also be translated as “in which.” Here it refers to the sphere of the Spirit and spiritual life mentioned in 3:18e. The GNT makes this explicit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in his spiritual existence (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He also went and preached to the spirits in prison:</strong> The Greek text does not say exactly where the spirits in prison were. One way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he went to the spirits in prison and preached to them</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>also:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>also</em> seems to function to introduce more information about the “spiritual realm” in 3:18e. It can also be translated as “even.” It is not translated in some versions such as the RSV. Translate it in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>preached:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>preached</em> can also be translated as “proclaimed” or “announced.” The text does not say what Christ proclaimed to the spirits in prison. Commentators suggest two possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Christ proclaimed his victory over the spiritual forces of darkness.</p></li><li><p>Christ preached about the need to repent and come to God for salvation.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">If you must choose, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), which has the support of most commentaries. This is based on the interpretation of “spirits” as evil spiritual beings. See the following note for more information.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways <em>preached</em> can be translated are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>proclaim his victory (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>made a proclamation (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the spirits:</strong> There are two ways to understand the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>spirits</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to evil spiritual beings such as demons or fallen angels.</p></li><li><p>It refers to the souls of dead people.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you use an expression that could refer to either of these. If you must choose between them, it is recommended that you choose interpretation (1). This is the normal meaning of <em>spirits</em> in the New Testament. It is also the view of the majority of modern commentators.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example, see Selwyn, pages 198–199; Michaels, pages 107–109; Achtemeier pages 260–261; Kelly pages 153–155; Marshall pages 125–127. For an opposing view (that of Augustine and Aquinas) that Christ preached through Noah to the disobedient people alive in Noah’s time, see Grudem. Bigg (page 162–3) believes that Christ here gave the spirits of dead people a chance to repent.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in prison:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>prison</em> refers to a place where people are guarded and cannot leave. Presumably the spirits were <em>in prison</em> because they were waiting for God to judge them. Your translation should not give the idea that the spirits were in an earthly prison, but rather that they were held in some kind of custody so that they could not escape.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who are being held/restrained</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who are waiting for the judgment of God</p></blockquote>",

God told Noah to build an ark to escape the flood he was going to send on the earth. While Noah and his family were building the ark, God waited patiently for other people to repent from their sins. But none of them repented.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>God waited patiently:</strong> <em>God waited patiently</em> for other people to repent from their sins. But none of them repented.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>ark:</strong> An <em>ark</em> is large boat. Some versions such as the NLT have:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>boat (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>3:20c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:20c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>In the ark a few people, only eight souls, were saved through water.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Only a few people, a total of eight, entered the boat and were brought safely through the water.</p></li><li><p>In this ark there were just a few people, a total of eight. God brought them safely through the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">flood</span> water,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>In the ark:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>In the ark</em> is literally “in which.” The Greek sentence continues into this verse part. It may be helpful in your language to start a new sentence here, as the BSB does.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a few people, only eight souls:</strong> In your translation use an expression that indicates that <em>eight</em> is a small number of people compared to the number of people who died in the flood. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>not very many people, a total of only eight</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>were saved through water:</strong> There are several ways of understanding the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>saved through water</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Noah and his family reached safety by passing through the water. In other words, they experienced the flood and survived. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>were brought safely through the water (RSV) <em>(BSB, NIV, NJB, NASB, REB, NET, CEV, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Noah and his family were saved by means of the water.

Noah and his family <em>were saved through water</em> in the sense that God preserved their lives as they lived through the flood.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>were saved:</strong> This is a passive verb. It was God who saved Noah and his family.

In some languages it may be more natural to begin a new sentence here, as the BSB and some other versions do. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And that water is a picture of baptism… (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>this water symbolizes the baptism that now saves you also:</strong> Peter was saying that Noah’s flood pointed forward in some way to Christian baptism. There are various ways of expressing this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>which was a symbol pointing to baptism, which now saves you (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>baptism, which this prefigured, now saves you (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is the baptism corresponding to this water which saves you now (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>this water symbolizes the baptism:</strong> The Greek text that the BSB translates as <em>this water symbolizes the baptism</em> is literally “this/which is an antitype/symbol of baptism.” The BSB has supplied the word <em>water</em>. “This/which” can also be understood as referring to the whole experience of passing through the flood. This is implied by the NET (context is given), which says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>20c</sup>In the ark a few, that is eight souls, were delivered through water. <sup>21a</sup>And this prefigured baptism… (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>symbolizes:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>symbolizes</em> in this context refers to representing something that is still future. Consider how you might say that something represents or illustrates something else that has not happened yet. Some other ways <em>symbolizes</em> has been translated are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>is a picture of (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>is like (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>which corresponds to (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>baptism:</strong> The word <em>baptism</em> refers to the ceremony of ritual washing to purify someone or something. It is connected to a person being purified from sin.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In translating this word, be sure to choose a term that is acceptable to all the churches in your area. Unless there is a term already in use by all churches, it may be better to borrow the word from Greek or your national language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate <em>baptism</em>:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a descriptive phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>sacred washing</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>purification/initiation <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for God</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>entering water</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a term for a similar ritual that is already part of your culture. You may need to indicate that in this context it has a special connection with God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>God’s</u> ceremonial bath</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>initiation washing <u>for God</u></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a term that is already accepted by the local churches. In some areas this term may have been borrowed from the national language or transliterated from Greek or English.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages you may need to <u>use a verb</u> to translate <em>baptism</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">ritually</span> wash/clean</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>initiate <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> in/with water</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>purify people in God’s ceremonial bath</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>that now saves you also:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>saves</em> means to rescue someone from danger or trouble. In this context, <em>saves</em> is being used in a very general way. The act of receiving baptism does not directly save a person. Baptism is an outward symbol of what God does when he cleanses a person, raises him from spiritual death, and gives him new life.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate <em>saves</em> include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>rescues</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>causes you to escape</p></blockquote><h4>3:21b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:21b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>not the removal of dirt from the body,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Baptism is not about getting rid of dirt from the body.</p></li><li><p>Being baptised is not a matter of cleaning the body,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not the removal of dirt from the body:</strong> The phrase <em>not the removal of dirt from the body</em> means “baptism is not about removing dirt from your body.” Baptism was a form of ritual washing, but it was not the cleaning of the body that was important. Some other ways this phrase has been translated include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>not the washing of dirt from the body (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>more than just washing your body (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>3:21c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:21c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>No, it is about appealing to God to give you a clear/clean conscience.</p></li><li><p>but rather it is a matter of asking God to cleanse your hearts.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>but</em> introduces a contrast. Peter had just said in 3:21b what aspect of baptism was not important, and now in 3:31c he states what aspect of baptism is important. Translate this contrast in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the pledge of a clear conscience:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>pledge</em> literally means “request” or “appeal.” In this context it can mean “promise,” “appeal,” or “answer.” There are therefore several ways of understanding the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the pledge of a clear conscience</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “asking for a clear conscience.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>an appeal to God for a clear conscience (RSV) <em>(NASB, GW, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “making a promise from a clean conscience.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the promise made to God from a good conscience (GNT) <em>(NET, NCV, GNT; probably NJB, NIV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “promising to live with a clear conscience.” This interpretation has the strongest support from biblical scholars.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This understanding is suggested by Marshall page 131; Best page 148; Achtemeier page 270–272; Kelly page 163.</span></span> It is a possible understanding of the NJB:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the pledge of a good conscience (NJB) <em>(possibly BSB, NIV, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “asking <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for salvation/forgiveness</span> from a clear conscience.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the appeal made to God from a good conscience (REB) <em>(NLT, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “responding from a clear conscience.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the answer of a good conscience (KJV) <em>(KJV, probably CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). However, any of the interpretations are possible, and you may wish to consult the major language version in your area.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>toward God:</strong> There are two ways of understanding the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>toward God</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <em>toward God</em> and modifies the phrase “good conscience.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the pledge of a good conscience toward God (NIV) <em>(BSB, NIV, KJV, GNT, NJB, CEV, NCV, REB, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>to God</u> and modifies the word “pledge/appeal/answer.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>an appeal to God for a good conscience (NASB) <em>(RSV, NLT, GW, NCV, NASB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), which has more commentary support.</p><h4>3:21d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:21d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>This <span data-bnType=\"implied\">baptism</span> saves you because Jesus Christ has risen from the dead.</p></li><li><p>Jesus Christ has come alive from the dead.

It is because Jesus Christ has been raised from the dead that people who are baptized are saved.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the resurrection of Jesus Christ:</strong> The phrase <em>the resurrection</em> refers to the event when God caused Jesus to live again. Some other ways <em>resurrection</em> can be translated are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>rise from the dead</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>come alive from the dead</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> caused…to live again</p></blockquote>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>messengers <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from God/heaven</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">good/holy</span> spirit-beings</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a local term that fits the biblical meaning.</p></li><li><p>In some areas the churches may already be using a borrowed term or a transliterated word for “angel.” Be sure that this term fits the biblical meaning. If some people do not understand the right meaning from this term, you may need to indicate the meaning in some way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>an <em>angelos </em>messenger <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from God</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a sacred <em>angelos </em>spirit</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Be sure that your term for “angel” is different from your terms for “prophet” and “apostle.”</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>authorities, and powers:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>authorities, and powers</em> refers to supernatural forces that were believed to affect the lives of people. Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>spirits <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the sky</span> who have authority and power</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>supernatural beings who have authority and power</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>subject to Him:</strong> The phrase <em>subject to him</em> here means “recognizing Christ’s authority”; that is, obeying him. Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>under his control (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>ruling over all angels and heavenly authorities and powers (GNT)</p></blockquote>",

The fact that Christ <em>suffered in His body</em> was the basis for what he was about to command his readers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ suffered in His body:</strong> The Greek expression that the BSB translates as <em>Christ suffered in His body</em> means that Christ suffered physically. It is probably referring specifically to Christ’s death on the cross. Refer back to your translation of 3:18d, where the same word (“flesh”) is used for <em>body</em>.

It can also be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>thought (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>way of thinking (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to translate it as a verb phrase.

Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>whoever suffers physically (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>is done with sin:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>is done with sin</em> in this context means “has renounced/ rejected sin.” A person who is willing to suffer persecution because of Christ has shown that he has renounced sin. He wants to obey Christ whatever happens. He has decided it is better to suffer than to sin. An English idiom that expresses this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>has made a clean break with sin</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>is finished with sin (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to translate <em>sin</em> as a verb.

(NET) <em>(CEV, NJB, NET; possibly NLT)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Selwyn, page 210: “This…sentence illustrates what the author means by ceasing from sins.” The boundary between interpretations (1) and (2) is not always clear.</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This is the view of the majority of commentators. A Christian renounces or rejects sin <u>so that</u> he or she may live in a way that pleases God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he does not live out his remaining time on earth for human passions, but for the will of God:</strong> In some languages in may be natural to put the positive statement before the negative:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he lives the rest of his earthly life for the will of God, not for evil human desires</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>not…for human passions:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>not…for human passions</em> here means “not trying to do wrong things any more.” Other ways of translating this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>no longer concerned about the evil things people desire</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not guided/controlled by sinful human desires (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>human passions:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>human passions</em> is simply “desires.” This word generally implies wrong or selfish desires. Some translations such as the NIV make that explicit by saying “evil desires.” See also the note on 1:14b, where the same word is used. In some languages it may be possible to use a word that itself implies that the desires are wrong. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>bad things (EASY)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>lusts</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>his remaining time on earth:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>his remaining time on earth</em> is literally “the remaining time in flesh.” It refers to a person’s life on earth after he renounces sin. Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the rest of your lives on earth (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the rest of your time here in the world</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:1–2</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The BSB, like the Greek, switches from the second person (“you”) to the third person (“he”) in 4:1c–2 and then back to the second person again in 4:3. In some languages it may be natural to use second person pronouns throughout. For example, the CEV translates 4:1–2 as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1</sup>Christ suffered here on earth. Now you must be ready to suffer as he did, because suffering shows that you have stopped sinning. <sup>2</sup>It means you have turned from your own desires and want to obey God for the rest of your life.

However, that is not what Peter meant. He disapproved of how his readers had lived in the past. You may need to make this clear by translating this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In the past you spent your time <span data-bnType=\"implied\">wrongly,</span> doing what pagans choose to do</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In the past you wasted too much time doing what nonbelievers enjoy (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in the past:</strong> The phrase <em>in the past</em> refers to the time before the readers of this letter became Christians.

Before they became Christians, Peter’s readers did whatever they wanted to do, not what God wanted them to do.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Gentiles:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>Gentiles</em> is literally “the nations.” It refers to non-Jewish peoples who did not worship the true God.

Here is another way to translate these words:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>having wild parties and drunken orgies (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some translations combine the two ideas into one noun phrase, For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wild and drunken parties (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:3d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:3d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and detestable idolatry.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and joined in the forbidden worship of false gods.</p></li><li><p>You worshipped detestable/disgusting idols.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>detestable idolatry:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>detestable</em> is literally “against the law.” Here it describes behavior that God had forbidden and could therefore be considered shocking and disgusting. If your language has a word meaning “outside the boundaries of law,” you might be able to use it here. Try to use a word that implies something is to be rejected as repulsive. Other English translation models include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the forbidden worship of idols (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the disgusting worship of idols (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>doing shameful things in your worship of idols</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:3b–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek, as in the BSB, the different evil behaviors are all listed as abstract nouns. In some languages it may be necessary to use verb phrases. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You sinned sexually and followed your evil passions. You got drunk and went to wild drinking parties. You stepped over God’s boundaries by worshiping idols.</p></blockquote></div>",

It summarizes how the pagans lived. There were no limits to the shameful things they did. Some English translations do not use the metaphor of a <em>flood</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the many wild and wasteful things they do (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Consider if it is natural in your language to keep the flood metaphor.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>reckless indiscretion:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>reckless indiscretion</em> means “unrestrained riotous behavior.” The word occurs also in Luke 15:13. Some other ways it is translated include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>wild and reckless living (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the many wild and wasteful things (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:4c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:4c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and they heap abuse on you.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and they revile you.</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so</span> they speak evil of you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and:</strong> The BSB has supplied the word <em>and</em>.

Translate this connection in your language in a way that is natural.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they heap abuse on you:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>they heap abuse on you</em> means “they speak evil of you.” It is a strong word that is often used of sinning by speaking evil of something that is holy.

A clear explanation of these is given in the UBS Translator’s Handbook. Apparently Peter was saying that the gospel was preached to people who are now dead during the time when they were still alive. Although these people died as all people do, God is able to give them true spiritual life, so they might live as he lives.</p><h4>4:6a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:6a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>That is why the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For this is why <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ’s followers</span> preached the Good News to those who are now dead,</p></li><li><p>This is the reason <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believers</span> preached the gospel <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about Jesus</span> to the people who have now died as well,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">There is a Greek conjunction meaning “For” at the beginning of this verse that connects it in a general way with 4:1–5. Some English versions do not translate it explicitly (BSB, CEV, GNT, NCV, REB). Connect 4:6 to 4:1–5 in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>That is why:</strong> There are two ways of understanding the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>That is why</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It looks forward to the rest of the verse. The reason is given in 4:6c. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6a</sup>it was for this very purpose…<sup>6b</sup>so that…<sup>6c</sup>they may live spiritually (NET) <em>(BSB, CEV, KJV, NASB, RSV, NET; possibly NIV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It looks backward, to what Peter had just said. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>That is why (GNT) <em>(GNT, NCV, REB; possibly NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). The phrase <em>That is why</em> is referring to the purpose introduced by “so that” in 4:6b.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the gospel was preached:</strong> This is a passive verb. Peter did not say who preached the gospel. If you must provide a subject, it is recommended that you provide a general one such as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>people</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you must be more specific, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Christ’s followers/disciples</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>even to those who are now dead:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>even</em> can also be translated as “as well” or “also.” That is, the gospel was preached to the dead <u>as well</u> as to the living. The NJB translates it in this way and says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the gospel was brought to the dead as well (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>who are now dead:</strong> Peter did not say which dead people he was thinking of. Probably he was thinking of people who had heard the gospel while they were alive and had since died. Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to the dead (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>4:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that they might be judged as men in the flesh,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that although they were judged like men in their physical bodies,</p></li><li><p>so that although <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> judged them <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and they died</span> physically as all men do,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that:</strong> The phrase <em>so that</em> introduces a purpose clause. The purpose is in 4:6c. The GNT therefore puts the purpose marker in 4:6c. You should translate this phrase in a way that naturally introduces a purpose in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they might be judged as men in the flesh:</strong> Peter was implying that these people died as a result of being judged. It was because they had received punishment <em>as men in the flesh</em> that they were now dead.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is not the purpose introduced by “so that.” It is a concessive clause<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A concessive clause is a clause that in English begins with “although” or “even though” and expresses an idea that suggests the opposite of the main part of the sentence.</span></span> and means “although they were judged….” Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>though judged in the flesh like men (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>they might be judged:</strong> This is also a passive verb. Peter did not say who would judge these people. Probably he was thinking of God, as in 4:5. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that God might judge them</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>as men:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>as men</em> in this context probably means “like all men” or “as sinful human beings.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as everyone is judged (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in the flesh:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>in the flesh</em> in this context means “physically” or “in their flesh.” This is the same word for “flesh” that is used in 3:18d and 4:2a–b (where it is translated by the BSB as “remaining time on earth”). These people died on earth. There was no longer any life in their bodies. Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in their physical existence (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>4:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but live according to God in the spirit.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>their spirits may live <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in heaven</span>, as God lives.</p></li><li><p>they may live spiritually like God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>but</em> introduces the second half of a contrast. The contrast is between being judged in their <u>physical existence</u> in 4:6b and <u>living spiritually</u> in 4:6c.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In accordance with English style, translations such as the RSV that have used “though/although” in 4:6b do not translate this explicitly. Translate this contrast in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>live according to God in the spirit:</strong> This is a contrast with what happened in 4:6b. God could make these people alive again in the realm of the spirit. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in their spiritual existence they may live as God lives (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>according to God:</strong> This is a contrast with “as men” in 4:6b. Although these people died as all men die, because they had received the gospel, they could live as God lives. Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>like God (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in the spirit:</strong> The phrase <em>in the spirit</em> is in contrast with “in the flesh” in 4:6b. It is referring to what happens in the spiritual realm, that is, in heaven or in eternity.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">See also the notes on 3:18d and 3:18e, where the same contrast occurs between what happened in the body and what happened in the spirit.</p>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>NET footnote: “Christian love is patient and forgiving towards the offences of a fellow Christian.” <em>(NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>If you love one another, God will forgive your sins. This is perhaps implied by the NCV:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>love will cause many sins to be forgiven <em>(NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English translations do not say explicitly who loves and whose sins are covered. However, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). The person who loves a fellow Christian covers or forgives their sins. This is the view of the majority of modern commentators.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Achtemeier page 296; Grudem page 173; Best page 159; Davids; Michaels page 247 is somewhat different: He says that through Christian love “sin as a social phenomenon can be blotted out.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>covers over:</strong> In this context, <em>covers over</em> means “forgives.” A literal translation may suggest that sins are hidden, that is, concealed or kept secret. That is not what Peter meant here. A person who wishes his sins to be covered may first need to confess them to God and other people. Some other ways <em>covers over</em> has been translated are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>cancels (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wipes away (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a multitude:</strong> The phrase <em>a multitude</em> means “many.” However, a literal translation may imply that there will be sins the believer can choose not to forgive. This is not the meaning here. In some languages, it may therefore be necessary to translate this as part of the verb, indicating that the one who loves forgives sins frequently or regularly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span> will keep on forgiving <span data-bnType=\"implied\">their</span> sins</p></blockquote>",

Here is another way to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Rather (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>rejoice that you share in the sufferings of Christ:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>rejoice that you share in the sufferings of Christ</em> is literally “rejoice to the extent that you share in the sufferings of Christ.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>rejoice:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>rejoice</em> is a strong word that can be translated as “leap/dance for joy.” See 1:6a, where the same word occurs and is translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>greatly rejoice</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>share in the sufferings of Christ:</strong> Believers were to some extent suffering in the same way that Christ suffered. However, believers cannot completely suffer as Christ did. To the extent that believers do suffer as Christ did, they should be glad.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other ways this phrase has been translated include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>rejoice in so far as you share in Christ’s suffering (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>be very glad—for these trials make you partners with Christ in his suffering (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Be glad for the chance to suffer as Christ suffered.

The same word for “revelation” is used in 1:7e.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>glory:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>glory</em> refers to a shining brightness.

See Malachi chapter 3, Ezekiel chapter 9, and Jeremiah 25:29.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>For</em> introduces a reason why Christians should praise God if they suffer for being a Christian (4:16b). That reason is stated in 4:17a: The time of judgment will soon begin with the family of God. Translate this conjunction in a way that is natural for your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it is time for judgment to begin:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>time</em> in this context means the “right season.” In Peter’s time, God’s chosen time for judging people had begun.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for judgment to begin:</strong> In some languages it may be necessary to translate <em>judgment</em> as a verb.

Peter was saying that the judgment was in fact beginning with Christians. So it may be necessary to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and since it is beginning with us…</p></blockquote><h4>4:17c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:17c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>what will the outcome be for those who disobey the gospel of God?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>what will it be like <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when he judges</span> those who disobey the gospel he gave?</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God will judge</span> the people who refuse his Good News much more severely.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>what will the outcome be for those who disobey the gospel of God?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question.

Peter was implying that something very bad was going to happen to the ungodly and the sinner. There are two ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>as a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…what will become of the ungodly and sinners?

He explained that it is a blessing to be insulted for following Christ. He also reminded them that a time of judgment was coming. Some other headings for this section include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Suffering as Christ suffered</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your attitude when you suffer</p></blockquote></div><h4>4:19a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:19a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So then, those who suffer according to God’s will</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Therefore, people who suffer because God wishes it</p></li><li><p>And so, if God is permitting you to suffer,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So then:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>So then</em> introduces a conclusion to what Peter had just been saying. In view of 4:12–18, this is what suffering believers should do. Here is another way to translation this transition:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Therefore (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those who suffer according to God’s will:</strong> There are two ways of understanding the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>those who suffer according to God’s will</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to people who suffer because it is God’s will; that is, because God permits it. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because that is God’s will for them (GNT) <em>(GW, NJB, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to people who suffer in the way God wants; that is, for obeying God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If you suffer for obeying God… (CEV) <em>(NCV, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Many other English versions are ambiguous (BSB, NIV, NASB, RSV, NLT, REB, NET). It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This interpretation follows Peter’s general theme in this letter of God requiring believers to suffer.</p><h4>4:19b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:19b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>should entrust their souls to their faithful Creator</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>should put themselves into the hands of God who created them and who will keep his word.</p></li><li><p>you should entrust yourself to him, for he is your Maker.

So the BSB has supplied the word <em>their</em>, and this may be natural in other languages also. Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>their Maker (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the God who created you (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>faithful:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>faithful</em> means “reliable, trustworthy.” God keeps his word, and he will not forsake anyone who believes in him. The GNT has:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who always keeps his promise</p></blockquote><h4>4:19c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:19c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and continue to do good.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They should also continue to do good.</p></li><li><p>You should also keep on acting in a way that is right.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and continue to do good:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>and continue to do good</em> is literally “in good action.” The verb related to this is also used in 2:15, 2:20 and 3:6. For reasons of English style, many English versions translate it here as a command (NIV, REB, CEV, RSV, GW). Other ways to translate it include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as they do good (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as they continue to do what is right (NCV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:18–19</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Peter used the third person to speak about those who were suffering (“those who suffer”). But he was referring to those of his readers who were suffering. So in some languages it may be natural to use the second person “you<sup>(plur)</sup>”:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So those among you who are suffering in accordance with God’s will should entrust yourselves to your faithful Creator and continue to do good.</p></blockquote></div>",

He was an elder, a church leader, as they were.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a witness of Christ’s sufferings:</strong> There are several ways of understanding the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>a witness of Christ’s sufferings</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means that Peter was an eyewitness to how Jesus suffered.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Selwyn page 229.</span></span> (This does not necessarily mean that Peter was claiming to have been present at the crucifixion.)

Connect 5:1b and 5:1c together in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a partaker of the glory to be revealed:</strong> Peter was continuing to describe himself. He looked forward to having a part in the glory that would be seen when Jesus returned to this earth. In some languages it may be natural to make it clear by using the first-person pronoun “I,” as the CEV has done:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and I will share in his glory when it is shown to us (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the glory:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>glory</em> refers to the bright light that reflects and symbolizes the greatness of God and Christ. See how you translated <em>glory</em> in 4:11 and 4:13.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to be revealed:</strong> This is a passive verb. To “reveal” means to make known something that is hidden or secret.

These leaders would usually be chosen from among the older church members. Some other ways to translate this include using a general description.

In some languages it may be necessary to introduce it with a phrase such as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This is my appeal…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Be shepherds of God’s flock:</strong> This is a metaphor. In the lands of the Bible, <em>shepherds</em> cared for and protected sheep. Church leaders were to care for the members of the church as a shepherd took care of his sheep.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, a literal translation of this metaphor may be difficult to understand. Some other ways to translate it are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Change the metaphor to a simile.

A <em>flock</em> is a group of sheep. This is a metaphor for a church or congregation. In some languages it may be more natural and understandable to make the meaning clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>flock <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of sheep</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s people</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that is among you:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>that is among you</em> in this context means “that is your responsibility.” God had given each spiritual leader the responsibility of taking care of other Christians. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>entrusted to you (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for whom you are responsible (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that is under your care (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Try to translate using an expression that can be used both of a shepherd looking after his sheep and of a spiritual leader looking after Christians.</p><h4>5:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>watching over them not out of compulsion,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Do not watch over them because people compel you to work.</p></li><li><p>It is not out of duty/obligation that you should care for them,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>watching over them not out of compulsion:</strong> In some languages it may be natural to translate this as one simple command. Be careful, however, to make it clear that Peter was not forbidding people to serve as overseers. He was forbidding them to serve with the wrong motives. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>do not serve as overseers because you are forced/obliged to</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>watching over them:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>watching over</em> is another term describing the work of church leaders and is similar in meaning to “shepherd.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There is a textual problem here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some Greek manuscripts contain the word translated as <em>watching over</em>.

Some commentators think that the word was omitted in some ancient manuscripts because it seemed to confuse the later church distinctions between elders and bishops.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>not out of compulsion:</strong> In Peter’s day, church members sometimes chose their own overseers and sometimes the apostles appointed them. People did not just volunteer to be overseers. So Peter was telling the people who were chosen not to serve out of a sense of obligation, as if they had no choice. Some other ways to translate this phrase include, negatively and positively:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Don’t do this because you have to (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>do it voluntarily (CEB)</p></blockquote><h4>5:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but because it is God’s will;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Instead, care for them because you freely choose to, as God desires.</p></li><li><p>but because you are happy to do it.

Express this contrast in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Instead (NIRV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because it is God’s will:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>because it is God’s will</em> is literally “willingly according to God.” Peter is telling the elders to serve willingly because this is what God wants them to do. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Watch over it willingly…because you are eager to serve God (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways of translating these words include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Do it willingly in order to please God (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because you are willing, as God wants you to be (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>it is God’s will:</strong> There is a textual problem with the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>it is God’s will</em>, which is literally “willingly according to God”:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some Greek texts <u>have</u> the words “according to God.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>willingly, as God would have you (ESV) <em>(BSB, NIV, NET, GNT, NRSV, NJB, NCV, CEV, REB, NASB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Some Greek texts <u>do not have</u> the words “according to God.” <em>(RSV, KJV, GW, NLT)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1), with the majority of English versions.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The words <em>κατ θεόν</em>, “according to God,” do not occur in some manuscripts.

Peter was not forbidding church leaders to receive wages. He was saying that they should not become leaders for the sake of the money they could receive.

It may also be helpful in your language to say what Peter wants the elders to do <em>out of eagerness</em>.

Church leaders should not behave like kings or chiefs who rule their people in a domineering way. The way church leaders behave should show believers how they themselves should behave. See Matthew 20:25 and Mark 10:42, where the same verb is used. Some other ways to translate this verb are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Don’t be bossy (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not be like a ruler (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>not domineering (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those entrusted to you:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>those entrusted to you</em> refers to the groups of believers who were assigned to the various church leaders.

Each elder was like a shepherd and the believers under his care were like his flock of sheep. So <em>the flock</em> is referring to the same people as “those entrusted to you” in 5:3a. You may want to translate <em>flock</em> the same way you did in 5:2a.</p>",

He is above all church leaders. In some languages it may not be clear that this expression refers to Christ. If that is true for your language, you should make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when <u>Christ</u> the Chief Shepherd (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>appears:</strong> The verb <em>appears</em> here refers to the time when Jesus will return to earth for everyone to see.

Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>our master, Christ, will give you (EASY)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>crown of glory:</strong> There are two ways of understanding the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>crown of glory</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means a crown that will consist of glory.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Davids; Best page 171; Marshall page 164; Kelly page 204; Selwyn page 233.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>glory, a crown that never fades (REB) <em>(NLT, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means a glorious crown. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a glorious crown (NCV) <em>(CEV, NCV, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). The reward or crown that believers will receive will be glory. This is the natural meaning in the context, since in 5:1 Peter had mentioned sharing Christ’s glory. This is also the view of many commentators.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>crown:</strong> The Greeks used to put a circle or garland of leaves on the head of the winner of a race as a sign that he was the victor. This was called the <em>crown</em>. Citizens who served their city well also received such a <em>crown</em>. It was a reward for having served well. Here Peter is using <em>crown</em> as a metaphor for the reward that God will give to his people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>glory:</strong> In this context, the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>glory</em> means “honor.” See how you translated <em>glory</em> in 4:14c and 5:1c.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>never fade away:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>fade away</em> describes the way in which flowers and leaves wither and die. Peter was contrasting a crown or garland of leaves to a “crown of glory.” Although a garland of leaves soon withers, the reward given to faithful church leaders will never spoil. It will last forever. See how you translated <em>fade</em> in 1:4. Some other ways to translate this word include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>never lose its brightness (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>never lose its beauty (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>of never-ending glory (NLT)</p></blockquote>",

It is a masculine form but can refer to people of both sexes. Peter was not excluding young women, so some versions translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>younger people (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you that are younger (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the same way:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>in the same way</em> appears to be a way of introducing a new subject on the same general theme. This same expression was used in 3:1, addressed to wives. As the elders submit to the Chief Shepherd, so the young men should submit to their elders. As it is a new subject, the most natural way to start the paragraph may be:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>As for you</u>, young men/men and women…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>submit yourselves to:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>submit yourselves to</em> means to accept the authority of someone. This is the same word that was used in 2:13a. Some other ways this word has been translated include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>accept the authority of (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>obey (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>your elders:</strong> There are two ways of interpreting the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>elders</em> here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to church leaders. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the elders (NJB) <em>(RSV, NJB, NET, GW, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to older people in general.

Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>everyone (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>clothe yourselves with humility:</strong> This is a metaphor. Peter was comparing <em>humility</em> to an item of clothing that a person wraps around himself. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>wrap yourselves in humility</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>cover/cloak yourself with humility</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>wear a humble attitude</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Avoid giving the impression that Peter was referring to hiding oneself. He wanted this virtue to be an important part of every believer’s way of thinking.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If it is hard to translate this metaphor in your language, you may need to say something more general:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>always behave in a modest/humble way</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Everyone should be humble toward everybody else. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>humility:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>humility</em> refers to having a modest and appropriate attitude towards oneself. It means not being proud or arrogant. In some languages, <em>humility</em> may need to be expressed in a verb form. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>be humble</p></blockquote><h4>5:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For <span data-bnType=\"implied\">it is as they wrote in the Book of God,</span></p></li><li><p>since <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the holy Scripture says</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>because</em> here introduces a quotation from the Scriptures that supports what Peter had just been saying.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">You may wish to make clear that the quotation is from Scripture (Proverbs 3:34) and say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as they wrote in God’s word/book</p></blockquote><h4>5:5d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:5d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“God rejects proud people, but he shows favour to people who are humble.”</p></li><li><p>“God resists arrogant people, but he is kind to humble/modest/lowly people.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble:</strong> This is a proverb or a saying similar in form to a proverb.

Some other ways this phrase is translated include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God is against the proud (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God resists the proud (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the proud:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>the proud</em> refers to people who are arrogant or haughty, who are not humble. These are people who think highly of themselves and despise others. They may think that they do not need God’s grace. Here are some other ways to translate this noun:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the arrogant (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>proud <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>but gives grace to the humble:</strong> This phrase describes the opposite situation. God does not oppose or refuse to help humble people. On the contrary, he is kind to them. See how you translated the related word “humility” in 5:5b.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>grace:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>grace</em> here refers to kindness or favor that is undeserved. See how you translated this word in 1:2e and 1:10a.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the humble:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>the humble</em> is the opposite of “the proud.” It refers to people who are modest and think of themselves in a humble and appropriate way. They realize that they are undeserving of God’s kindness. See how you translated the related word “humility” in 5:5b.

In this context it refers to accepting suffering from God without complaining. Some other ways to translate this expression are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>submit</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>make yourself low</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>therefore:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>therefore</em> connects Peter’s command here to the Scripture he has just quoted. Because of what the Scriptures say, this is what Peter’s readers are to do. Translate this connection in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>under God’s mighty hand:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates literally as <em>God’s mighty hand</em> is a figure of speech that refers to God’s great power. In this context it refers to God permitting his people to suffer persecution. Peter urged his readers to humbly accept such suffering as God’s will for them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to remove the <em>hand</em> metaphor.

Believers submit themselves to God and suffer patiently because they know that if they do, he will exalt them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in due time:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>in due time</em> means at the right time, the time that God has decided, the time he wishes. Most commentators agree that this refers to the return of Christ at the end of the age. Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when the right time comes (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>He may exalt you:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>exalt you</em> means “set you on high.” God will figuratively raise the believers up.

He began to introduce this theme with the quotation from Proverbs 3:34 in the last part of the previous verse.</p></div><h4>5:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Cast all your anxiety on Him,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Throw/put all the things which trouble you into God’s hands,</p></li><li><p>Tell God about all your needs and stop worrying about them,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Cast all your anxiety on Him:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>Cast all your anxiety on Him</em> is literally “casting all your anxiety on him,” continuing the sentence from the previous verse. The BSB has chosen to begin a new sentence here, as do many other English translations.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This Greek clause connects with the previous verse and suggests that one way in which we humble ourselves before God (5:6) is by casting all our anxiety onto him. The word <em>anxiety</em> means “fear, worry.” Peter wanted his readers to tell God about their concerns and trust him to take care of them. He used a figure of speech to express this idea, as if he wanted his readers literally to <em>Cast</em> or throw their worries onto God. Other ways of translating this clause include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>give all your worries to him (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Leave all your worries with him (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>If you have any kind of trouble in your mind, give it to God (EASY)</p></blockquote><h4>5:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because He cares for you.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because he is concerned about you.</p></li><li><p>for he wants to take care of you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because He cares for you:</strong> This verse part gives the reason why believers can freely cast their anxiety upon God. The reason is that God loves them and is concerned about their well-being. Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he provides what you need</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he is watching over you</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:7a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reverse the order of these verse parts and to give first the reason for the command:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7b</sup>God cares for you, so <sup>7a</sup>turn all your worries over to him (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7b</sup>He cares for you, so <sup>7a</sup>cast all your anxiety on him (REB)</p></blockquote></div>",

Here is another way to translate them separately:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Be alert and of sober mind (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Be sober-minded:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Be sober-minded</em> is a command to keep sober or think clearly. See how you translated this word in 1:13b and 4:7b. It can also be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Keep your mind clear (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Be on your guard (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Be…alert:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Be…alert</em> is a command to keep awake. This is a figure of speech. Peter wanted his readers to be awake spiritually, ready for anything that might happen. He wanted them to remain aware that Satan might attack them. Other English versions say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>watch out (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>stay awake (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>5:8b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour:</strong> The BSB in these verse parts is a mixture of a metaphor and a simile. In some languages it may be natural to translate it as <u>either</u> a metaphor <u>or</u> a simile (not a mixture). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your enemy the devil is a roaring lion that prowls around looking for something to eat.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your enemy the devil is like a roaring lion that prowls around looking for something to eat.</p></blockquote><h4>5:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Your enemy, Satan, is walking/going around like a lion who is roaring and</p></li><li><p>For you have an enemy, the devil.

In some languages it may be natural to make this clear by using the name:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Satan</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>prowls around:</strong> Someone who <em>prowls around</em> goes here and there as an animal does when it is looking for food. Some other ways to translate this phrase include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>goes around (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>sneaking around (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>like a roaring lion:</strong> This is a simile. Peter compared Satan to a <em>lion</em>. If there is no word for <em>lion</em> in your language, substitute the name of any fierce animal of prey such as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>leopard</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>hyena</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>roaring:</strong> This is the very loud noise that a lion makes.

Just as lions look around for animals to eat, Satan is also looking for opportunities to destroy people. He wants to do this by causing them to stop trusting in Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>someone:</strong> Lions look for animals to eat, but the devil does not want to destroy an animal. He wants to destroy a person. You may need to change this to a general word that could cover both people and animals. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>prey</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>devour:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>devour</em> means “eat up completely.” This is a metaphor referring to destroying someone for one’s own benefit.

In some languages it may be natural to break it up into shorter sentences, as in the CEV. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But God shows undeserved kindness to everyone. That’s why he had Christ Jesus choose you to share in his eternal glory. You will suffer for a while, but God will make you complete, steady, strong, and firm.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">It may then be necessary to supply an introductory phrase such as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Remember that</span></p></blockquote><h4>5:10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And after you have suffered for a little while,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You are suffering now, but after a short time</p></li><li><p>You will have to go though bad times a little longer.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And:</strong> There are two ways of interpreting the Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>And</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It introduces a <u>contrast</u> to the previous thought. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But (GNT) <em>(GNT, CEV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It introduces a <u>continuation</u> of the previous thought. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And (NET) <em>(BSB, NIV, ESV, NET, RSV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The NASB, NJB, REB and NLT do not explicitly translate this conjunction. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). You may translate the conjunction explicitly, or you may leave it implicit if that is more natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>after you have suffered for a little while:</strong> Peter referred to the way in which his readers were suffering at the time he was writing.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a little while:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>a little while</em> also occurs in 1:6b. It is vague as to the length of time, but in relation to eternity it is “short.” The restoration promised may be in this life or later when Jesus Christ is revealed. Another way to translate this expression is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a short time</p></blockquote><h4>5:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the God of all grace,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>the God who shows/gives great grace/kindness <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to his people</span></p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">But you should also remember/know that</span> God is very gracious <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to us</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the God of all grace:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the God of all grace</em> means “the God who gives all grace” or “the very gracious/kind God.” A similar phrase is used in 2 Corinthians 1:3, “the God of all comfort.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages the phrase <em>the God of all grace</em> may suggest that there are other gods who are not very gracious. If that is the case in your language, you may need to omit the definite article “the.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God, who gives all grace (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to make explicit to whom God gives grace. If that is the case in your language, supply a general object such as “us,” “you.” or “all people.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God, who shows you his kindness (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God shows undeserved kindness to everyone (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>grace:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>grace</em> here means “undeserved kindness/goodness.” See how you translated this word in 1:2e and 1:10a and 5:5d.</p><h4>5:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who has called you to His eternal glory in Christ,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>will enable you to share with Christ in his glory that will never end.</p></li><li><p>He has summoned us to be united with Christ in unending glory.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who has called you to His eternal glory in Christ:</strong> Peter was saying that God had chosen the believers to share in his glory.

See how you translated <em>glory</em> in 5:1b and 5:4b. Some other ways to translate <em>eternal</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>unending</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that lasts for ever</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in Christ:</strong> The phrase <em>in Christ</em> indicates the means in which we are called to share God’s glory.

They describe four things that God will do to strengthen the Christians when their time of suffering is over. The verbs have similar meanings, and Peter uses four of them together for emphasis.</p><h4>5:10d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:10d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>will Himself restore you,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will make you whole/new</p></li><li><p>God himself will bring you back to wholeness</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will Himself restore you:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>restore</em> means to repair, put into good condition, make whole again.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>establish and strengthen you (RSV) <em>(RSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1), with the majority of English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>secure you, strengthen you:</strong> The two Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>secure</em> and <em>strengthen</em> are a doublet. This means that these two words mean almost the same thing. Because this is a doublet, it is possible to translate these two words as one:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>strengthen you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>secure:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>secure</em> refers to God making us more capable. Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>confirm (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>strengthen:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>strengthen</em> refers to God making us strong with regard to our faith. Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>support…you (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>make you strong in your spirits (EASY)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>establish you:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>establish you</em> is a metaphor referring to providing a good foundation for a building. In some languages it may be natural to keep this figure of speech. In other languages it may be more natural to express the meaning. Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>place you on a firm foundation (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>establish you<sup>(plur)</sup> in your faith</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:10</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reorder this verse and put the reference to suffering at the beginning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You will have to suffer only for a little while: the God of all grace who called you to eternal glory in Christ will restore you, he will confirm, strengthen and support you. (NJB)</p></blockquote></div>",

First, he addressed the leaders and commanded them to be faithful in looking after the believers. He then addressed younger men in the church, and finally the whole community. He concluded this section by reminding them of God’s faithfulness.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other headings for this section include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Leading and Living in God’s Flock (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Advice for Elders and Young Men (NLT)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1061005008\" data-endVerseId=\"1061005011\"><h3>Paragraph 5:8–11</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Peter reminded his readers that Satan was their enemy and they needed to remain alert and steadfast.

Indeed, this is true!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>To Him be the power forever and ever:</strong> The BSB has supplied the word <em>be</em>. In the Greek text there is no verb in this sentence. So there are two ways of understanding this verse:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is a statement of what is already true. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>To him belongs the power forever.

Another way to translate this expression is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for all time</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Amen:</strong> In this context, the word <em>Amen</em> means “This is true!” or “Truly, this is so!” See how you translated this word in 4:11d.</p>",

In Acts he is called Silas. Some English versions follow the Greek and others translate this name as “Silas.” It is recommended that you follow the translation of your national or regional translation.</p><h4>5:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>whom I regard as a faithful brother,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I consider him as a faithful brother <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span>.</p></li><li><p>whom I know to be a faithful Christian.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>whom I regard as a faithful brother:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>whom I regard as a faithful brother</em> means that Peter viewed Silvanus as a faithful Christian believer. Peter was implying that his readers should also view Silvanus in this way and receive him warmly.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>faithful:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>faithful</em> in this context means someone who keeps his word and can be trusted. See how you translated this word in 4:19b, where it is used to describe God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>brother:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates literally as <em>brother</em> here refers to a fellow believer, a brother in Christ.</p><h4>5:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I have written to you briefly,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I have written this short letter to you</p></li><li><p>I am writing this short letter to you</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I have written:</strong> Peter is referring to this letter.

Here is another way to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>declaring (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>this is the true grace of God:</strong> Peter did not say what <em>this</em> refers to. Commentators suggest that <em>this</em> refers to the message of his letter. Peter was saying that all that he had written in his letter about God’s grace was true. So you could translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>what I am writing about God’s grace is true.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>true grace of God:</strong> The phrase <em>true grace of God</em> here refers to God’s goodness or kindness.

The BSB makes this explicit, as do some other translations. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your sister church in Babylon (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Babylon:</strong> <em>Babylon</em> is probably a secret name for Rome. So most commentators think that “She in Babylon” refers to the church in Rome, the city from which Peter was writing the letter. This information can be included in a footnote, if you are using footnotes in your translation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Peter probably used <em>Babylon</em> as a symbolic name for Rome because Rome was then the capital of the pagan world, just as Babylon had been the capital of the ancient pagan world. In Old Testament times Babylon was a godless city that was the center of opposition to God’s people. Babylon was also where the Jews lived when they were exiled from their own land, and Peter had described the people he was writing to as exiles (1:1c; 2:11a).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>chosen together with you:</strong> Peter was saying that God had chosen the believers in Babylon/Rome to be his people, just as he had chosen the Christians to whom Peter was writing.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This expression is passive. It may be more natural in your language to make it active and to indicate that God was the one who chose these believers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God has chosen them (EASY)</p></blockquote><h4>5:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>as does my son Mark.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>My son Mark also <span data-bnType=\"implied\">greets you</span>.</p></li><li><p>Mark, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">whom I love as</span> a son, also <span data-bnType=\"implied\">sends his greetings</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>my son Mark:</strong> <em>Mark</em> is probably the John Mark mentioned in Acts 12:12 who went with Paul on his first missionary journey. When Peter calls Mark <em>my son</em>, that does not mean that Peter was his real father, but that <em>Mark</em> was dear to Peter. If in your language “my son” would mean that Peter had fathered Mark, then you may need to make it clear that this is only a figure of speech. For example, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> a son to me</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as dear to me as</span> a son</p></blockquote>",

In New Testament times, members of a family showed their love for one another by greeting each other with a kiss on the cheek or forehead. It was also the custom in the meetings of the early church for Christians to express their affection for their fellow believers by kissing each other on the cheek or forehead.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Today in cultures where kissing is practiced, it is often strongly associated with sexual love, so a literal translation might convey the wrong meaning. In other cultures the custom of kissing is not known. In either case it may be better to use the word for the usual greeting or a general word such “embrace.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Give each other a warm greeting (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>embrace each other as fellow believers</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you use the word <em>kiss</em>, you may need to make clear the kind of kiss that Peter had in mind and the reason for it:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>kiss on the cheek to show your love for your fellow Christians.</p></blockquote><h4>5:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Peace to all of you who are in Christ.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>May all of you who are in Christ live in peace/harmony.</p></li><li><p>May <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God give</span> peace to you all who are joined/belong to Christ.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Peace to all of you who are in Christ:</strong> This is a blessing.
