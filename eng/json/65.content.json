After that, the writer included a prayer or blessing for their well-being. Jude followed this pattern.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Although Jude did not say where his readers lived, he did say three things about them. These three things are true of all believers:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>God had called them,</p></li><li><p>God the Father loved them,</p></li><li><p>God would keep them safe for the time when Jesus Christ would return.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">In these two verses Jude identified himself as the author of the letter and identified his readers by some of the things that God had done for them. Then he prayed that God would bless them. Jude chose a blessing which related well to the rest of the letter.</p></div><h4>1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Jude,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Jude <span data-bnType=\"implied\">writes this letter to you</span><sup>(plur)</sup>.</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span>, Jude, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">write this letter to you</span><sup>(plur)</sup>.</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">This letter comes from me,</span> Jude.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Jude:</strong> The BSB, like the Greek text, begins with the name of the writer and does not follow it with a verb. This was the common way to start a letter in New Testament times. In many languages today, including English, the writer’s name does not appear until the end of the letter. However, even if this is also true in your language, you should still include <em>Jude</em>’s name in this first verse. You may need to add a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><em>Jude</em> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">writes this letter to you</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, like Greek, it is acceptable for a writer to identify himself in the third person, as Jude did here. If this is not natural in your language, you could add a first person pronoun. For example,</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It is I,</span> <em>Jude</em>, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who write this letter to you</span>.</p></blockquote><h4>1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>a servant of Jesus Christ</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am</span> a servant of Jesus Christ,</p></li><li><p>I work for Jesus Christ,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a servant of Jesus Christ:</strong> Even though Jude was the brother of Jesus, he described himself as a <em>servant of Jesus Christ</em>. His brother James wrote the same thing about himself (James 1:1). This was a common way for followers of Jesus to describe themselves. It is often found at the beginning of the letters in the New Testament. (Philippians 1:1; Titus 1:1; James 1:1; 2 Peter 1:1.)</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>servant:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>servant</em> is <em>doulos</em>. This word may also be translated as “slave.” If your language does not have a noun for <em>servant</em>, you may use a verb instead. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span> serve Jesus Christ.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">who</span> works for Jesus Christ.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates here as <em>Christ</em> may be translated as part of the name, Jesus Christ. See Christ in the Glossary.</p><h4>1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and a brother of James,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am</span> a brother of James.</p></li><li><p>and James is my brother.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and a brother of James:</strong> We do not know which of the brothers was older, James<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In these Notes, <em>James</em> refers to an important leader of the church at Jerusalem (Acts 12:17), the James who was the brother of Jesus (as Paul says in Galatians 2:19). Jude was another brother of Jesus.</span></span> or Jude. If your language requires that you say which brother was older, you may say that Jude is the younger brother of James. It is likely that James was older, because he was an important leader of the Christians in Jerusalem.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>brother:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates here as <em>brother</em> can be used for different relationships. In some languages it is necessary to use a different expression for each of these relationships. James and Jude had the same mother and father.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>James:</strong> This <em>James</em> was a leader of the church at Jerusalem (Acts 12:17). He was also the brother<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some Christians believe that Jude and James were children born to both Joseph and Mary. Jesus would then be their older half-brother, since Joseph was not Jesus’ biological father. Others believe that Jude and James were the children of Joseph by a wife who had died before he married Mary. This would make Jesus their younger stepbrother. Still others believe that the “brother” relationship was by adoption or as part of an extended family. Those who believe in the perpetual virginity of Mary do not believe that Jude and James were born to Mary.</span></span> of Jesus (as Paul says in Galatians 1:19). Jude was another brother of Jesus. In some languages it may be helpful to include this information in a footnote in your translation.</p><h4>1d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>To those who are called,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I write</span> to those <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> who have been called <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by God to believe in him</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I write to you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> people whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has invited/asked <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to believe in him</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>To those who are called:</strong> Here Jude began to say something about the people to whom he was writing. In some languages it may be necessary to introduce this clause by a phrase like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I write</span> to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you,</span> those who….</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>called:</strong> Jude used the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>called</em> to refer to the Christian people to whom he was writing. He described them as <em>called</em>, because God had <em>called</em> them to believe in him. This can be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>To those <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> who have been called <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by God to believe in him</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>To <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you people</span> whom God has called <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to believe in him</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See the general comment at the end of the notes for 1f for other suggestions on using active verbs to translate the ideas in this verse.</p><h4>1e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>loved by God the Father,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">are united/joined with</span> God the Father <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">have been</span> loved by him.</p></li><li><p>God the Father loves you<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with the result that you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">are united/joined with him</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>loved by God the Father:</strong> A literal translation of the Greek text here is “having been loved in (<em>en</em>) God the Father.” This phrase includes two ideas:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>God the Father loved these Christians.</p></li><li><p>These Christians experienced God’s love in their relationship to him, united with him.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>John 17 has other examples where “in” has this meaning.</span></span> Jude expressed the same idea again in 21a where he encouraged his readers “to keep yourselves in the love of God.”</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">If possible, it is best to include both ideas in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who live in the love of God the Father (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You are united with</span> God the Father <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because you have been</span> loved by him.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God the Father loves you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with the result that you are united with him</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>loved:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Copies of the Greek text are slightly different from each other. The KJV has “sanctified” instead of “loved,” because it followed different copies than most other English versions followed. The best evidence supports “loved,” so it is recommended that you use the idea “loved” in your translation. However, if the major language version in your area uses “sanctified,” you may include a footnote to say that “sanctified” can be found in some Greek copies, but that the best evidence supports “loved.”</span></span> God had much affection for these Christians and great concern for their well-being. See Love, Meaning 1, in the Glossary.</p><h4>1f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and kept in Jesus Christ:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He/God</span> has kept <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> safe for Jesus Christ.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">and he</span> keeps <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> safe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to give/present you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> to Jesus Christ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when he returns</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>kept in Jesus Christ:</strong> In this context there are two ways to interpret the Greek expression<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Differences in interpretation arise, in part, because the Greek text has no preposition. In English, a preposition is required.</span></span> that the BSB translates as <em>kept in Jesus Christ</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means kept <u>for</u> <em>Jesus Christ</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>kept safe for Jesus Christ (NJB) <em>(GW, NASB, NET, NJB, NRSV, REB, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means kept <u>by</u> <em>Jesus Christ</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>kept safe by Jesus Christ (CEV) <em>(CEV, JBP, NIV, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Similar ideas are expressed in John chapter 17, especially in John 17:9 and John 17:15.</span></span> It is likely that Jude meant that God was the one who was keeping the readers <u>for</u> <em>Jesus Christ</em>. Jude may be implying “for Jesus Christ <u>when he returns</u>.” Here is an example of how to make this explicit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>are kept safe for the coming of Jesus Christ.(REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Jude may also imply:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">who are</span> kept safe by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God to give/present to</span> Jesus Christ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">at his return</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>kept:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Jude frequently used the Greek verb, <em>tēreō</em>, which the BSB translates here as <em>kept</em>. He used a form of <em>tēreō</em> in 1f, 6a, 6c, 13d (where the BSB uses the verb “reserved”), and 21a. Though it was possible for Jude to use one verb in all these places, the meanings translated into natural English require the use of more than one English verb.</span></span> They were being kept safe.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1d–f</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be necessary to use more active verbs to translate 1d–f.

The word <em>faith</em> here does not refer to the act of believing, but to <u>what Jude and his readers believed</u>. Jude meant that they were to struggle hard to defend from error the true Christian teaching that they had been taught and had believed. He also meant they were to promote <em>the faith</em> by living according to what it taught them (see verses 20–23).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>urge you:</strong> Jude told the readers what he wanted them to do in a polite way. He was encouraging them to follow his advice. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to encourage you (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>encouraging you (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You may be able to translate this as a request. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and ask you (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to appeal to you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>you:</strong> In Greek there is no pronoun (<em>you</em>) after the verb that the BSB translates here in 3e as “urge.” In the Greek text, the pronoun (literally “to you”) occurs after the verb “write” in 3d. Literally, it is “write <u>to you</u>.” However, the BSB chose to place the pronoun after the verb “urge” in 3e. You should place the pronoun where it is most natural in your language. It may be necessary to use a pronoun with both “write” and “urge.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to contend earnestly:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>to contend</em> is translated by many English versions as “fight.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Modern English versions with a form of “fight” are GW, JBP, NCV, NJB, and GNT.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to fight hard (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, Jude did not mean that his readers should fight physically. He was urging them to use all their strength<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This Greek verb is <em>epagōnizomai</em>. Originally, it spoke of an athlete competing to win.</span></span> and ability to resist, counteract, and defeat false teaching. Specifically, Jude wanted them to resist the false teaching of the ungodly people whom he would write about in verse 4. He did not want his readers to be harmed by participating in the sinful actions of those ungodly people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the faith:</strong> Here Jude referred to the true Christian teaching as <em>the faith</em>. He called it <em>the faith</em>, because it is what Jude and his readers believed. See faith, Meaning 2, in the Glossary.</p><h4>3f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>entrusted once for all to the saints.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>which was entrusted one time for all <span data-bnType=\"implied\">time</span> to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">us</span><sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who are God’s</span> holy/sanctified people.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> gave this unchanging <span data-bnType=\"implied\">true teaching</span> to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">us</span><sup>(incl)</sup>, the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> who believe in him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>entrusted once for all to the saints:</strong> This part of the verse further describes the “faith,” which Jude mentioned in 3e.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>once for all:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>once for all</em> may also be translated as “one time for all times” (see Jude 1:3 in UBS). It indicates that “the faith” is unique and that it does not change.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Someone might try to change the faith, the true teaching. The CEV and NLT imply this when they use “to defend” to translate the Greek word which the BSB translates as “contend.” (See the note above for “contend.”)</span></span> No one is allowed to change it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">To translate <em>once for all</em>, you may be able to find a word or phrase that communicates the three parts of its meaning:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>God only had to give this faith to the believers one time.</p></li><li><p>Its teachings would never change throughout the rest of time.</p></li><li><p>They were adequate for all times.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to say this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>once to last forever</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>unique and unchangeable throughout all time</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>entrusted:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Other versions that translate this as “entrusted” are NIV, GW, NET, NJB, NRSV and REB.</span></span> translates as <em>entrusted</em> can also be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>delivered (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>committed (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>given (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The verb implies that the first Christians received the true teachings, and they had the responsibility pass these true teachings faithfully to other people. The text does not say who entrusted the teachings to the first Christians. It could have been God or Jesus or the apostles. If you need to specify who <em>entrusted</em> the teachings to the Christians, it is recommended that you say God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the saints:</strong> The Greek expression that the BSB translates as <em>the saints</em> is literally “the holy (ones)” and means “the holy people.” This expression was used by many New Testament authors to refer to Christians, the people who believe in Jesus Christ. When used in this way, it refers to all Christians, including Jude and his readers. Some ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s holy people.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who believe/trust in Jesus Christ.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people dedicated to God.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See holy, Meaning 1, in the Glossary.</p>",

Because ungodly people had come into their church, the Christians to whom Jude was writing had to defend what they believed. These ungodly people were especially dangerous because the true believers had not recognized that the ungodly people were not really Christians. They were “fake” Christians.</p></div><h4>4</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In this verse, Jude explained the problem that faced the Christians to whom he was writing. People who did not really believe the truth about God were gathering with the real Christians. They were fake Christians.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In verse 4, Jude first mentioned the people who had secretly slipped into the Christian congregation. Jude mentioned them many more times in this letter, but he referred to them with a pronoun, not a name or descriptive phrase. In order to refer to them clearly in these Notes, they are called <u>fake Christians</u>. This matches Jude’s distinctive description of them here in verse 4.</span></span><span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Other writers have referred to these people as “false teachers,” “ungodly men,” or “ungodly people.” Each of these has some difficulty:<u>False teachers</u>: While the texts from which Jude chose his illustrations may imply that these people were teachers or leaders, Jude nowhere directly described them as such. The people Jude had in mind may have included some people who were not teachers or leaders.<u>Ungodly men</u>: Were there no women among these fake Christians? Jude does not say specifically.<u>Ungodly men</u> and <u>ungodly people</u>: To call these fake Christians “ungodly men” or “ungodly people” does not distinguish them from other groups of people in this letter. Jude also referred to ungodly people who were not part of this group, for example, the “ungodly” in verse 15.Therefore, in these Notes, “fake Christians” refers to the people whom Jude described as people who had secretly slipped in among the true believers.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to reorder 4a–c as shown in the Display. The Notes will use this order in the discussion that follows.</p><h4>4a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For certain men</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am writing this letter to you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> because some people</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> The Greek conjunction <em>gar</em> that the BSB translates here as <em>For</em> connects verse 4 with verse 3. It indicates that verse 4 is a reason for an idea<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There are two interpretations as to what this was in verse 3:(1) The presence of these fake Christians was the reason <u>Jude wrote this letter</u>.(2) The presence of these fake Christians was the reason why <u>the true believers needed to contend for the Christian faith</u>.Most English versions are ambiguous, allowing for either interpretation. For languages that must select one of the two interpretations, interpretation (1) is recommended in the Notes, because it implies both interpretations. Because Jude said in verse 3 that <u>he wrote this letter</u> in order to encourage the readers <u>to contend for the Christian faith</u>, translating according to interpretation (1) implies interpretation (2) as well.</span></span> in verse 3. If your language requires you to say what that idea is, the context shows that it is the reason that Jude wrote this letter. In order to make this connection clear, you may need to make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am writing these things to you</span> because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">there are</span> certain men <span data-bnType=\"implied\">among you</span>…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">For languages that normally place the reason first, it may be more natural to change the order of verses 3 and 4. See the general comment on 3–4 at the end of the notes for 4f for an example.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>certain men:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates here as <em>men</em> can also refer to people in general. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Certain people (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>certain persons (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Some people (GW, NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>4b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>have crept in among you unnoticed—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>who pretend to believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Jesus Christ</span> have infiltrated your<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">group</span>.</p></li><li><p>who say they believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Jesus Christ</span>, but who <span data-bnType=\"implied\">really</span> do not, have joined your<sup>(plur)</sup> congregation/church.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>have crept in among you unnoticed:</strong> This is a metaphor. Jude used it to describe how the fake Christians had deceived the true Christians. When the fake Christians joined the church, the true Christians were unaware that these fake Christians did not really believe the truth.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>unnoticed:</strong> Jude indicated here that the fake Christians hid their wrong beliefs when they joined this group of believers. It was not a secret that they had joined the group. Jude’s readers did not realize that these fake Christians did not really believe the truth. Some ways to say this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>4a</sup>certain people <sup>4b</sup>have infiltrated your group.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>4a</sup>certain people <sup>4b</sup>who pretend to believe have joined your group.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>4a</sup>certain people, <sup>4b</sup>who say they believe, but who really do not, have joined your group.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">A general comment at the end of the notes for 4f shows that 4a–f may be reordered, with 4d placed earlier in the verse. In some languages, this may be more natural.</p><h4>4c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>ungodly ones</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They do not respect God.</p></li><li><p>These people do not acknowledge <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that</span> God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">has authority over them</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>ungodly ones:</strong> Jude described the fake Christians as <em>ungodly</em>, because they did not respect God or his authority. Because these people did not respect God’s authority over them, they lived sinful lives. Other ways to say this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They do not respect God.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They do not respect <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the authority of</span> God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">over them</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>ones:</strong> The BSB has supplied the word <em>ones</em> to refer to people in general. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>godless people (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>ungodly persons (NASB, RSV)</p></blockquote><h4>4d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who were designated long ago for condemnation.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Long ago the punishment/doom of these men was written about.</p></li><li><p>A long time ago it was written that these men would be condemned.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The Scriptures</span> that were written long ago <span data-bnType=\"implied\">say</span> that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will judge and punish them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who were designated long ago for condemnation:</strong> Jude described the people he had mentioned in 4a as people <em>who were designated long ago for condemnation</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>were designated:</strong> In this context there are several ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>were designated</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>written about</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the prophets wrote about these people (NCV) <em>(CEV, GW, NCV, NIV, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means that either the people or their punishment was <u>designated</u> or <u>determined</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The fate of such people was determined long ago. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who were long beforehand marked out for this condemnation. (NASB) <em>(BSB, KJV, NLT, NRSV, RSV, NASB, NET, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Jude probably meant that their condemnation was written about in the Old Testament. This interpretation is used in the Meaning Lines of the Display.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the main section of this letter, verses 5–19, Jude used many examples from the Old Testament. However, he also used some examples that are not from the Old Testament (see verses 9, 14–15, 17–18). Therefore, it is best not to specify where the condemnation of these people was written about. However, if your language requires you to make explicit where this was written, you may use your key term for “scripture.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>scripture (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Scriptures (GNT, CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Jude did not mean that the scriptures contained a list of the names of these people. Instead, he meant that God had said in the scriptures that he would punish people who sinned like these people did.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>condemnation:</strong> The word <em>condemnation</em> refers here to God judging<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>From the parallel passage of 2 Peter 2:9, Jude was apparently referring to the judgment which God will speak against them on the last day. This is true regardless of which letter was written first.</span></span> these people and condemning them. This <em>condemnation</em> implies two ideas:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>God would judge them and pronounce them “guilty” of certain sins. Jude listed these sins in 4e–f.</p></li><li><p>This <em>condemnation</em> also included the punishment that they would receive because of these sins.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions also imply both of these ideas. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>…long ago the Scriptures warned that these godless people were doomed (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>4e–f</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 4e–f, Jude mentioned two ways in which these people showed that they did not respect God.</p><h4>4e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>They turn the grace of our God into a license for immorality,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They say/believe that</span> since our<sup>(incl)</sup> God is kind <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to people</span>, they may live/behave immorally,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They use the fact that</span> our<sup>(incl)</sup> God forgives <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people who sin</span> as an excuse <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for them</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to continue</span> to sin sexually.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>They turn the grace of our God into a license for immorality:</strong> These fake Christians were using God’s grace as an excuse to do whatever they wanted to do. They were saying that since God is kind and forgives people when they sin, it was therefore acceptable to continue to behave immorally.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Paul spoke against this false teaching in Romans 5:20–6:2.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the grace:</strong> In this context, <em>grace</em> refers to God’s <u>kindness</u> towards human beings and his <u>desire to forgive</u> their sins. God showed this kindness by sacrificing his Son, Jesus Christ, to enable people to have fellowship with God. The <em>grace</em> of God made Jesus willing to suffer and die to save human beings from being damned because of their sins. For example, the NLT translates <em>the grace</em> as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s forgiveness (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See grace in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>our God:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Several versions omit <em>our</em> (CEV, GW, JBP, NLT). The Greek text includes this idea.</span></span> Jude referred to God as <u><em>our</em></u> <em>God</em>, to indicate the close relationship that he and the true believers had with <em>God</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, in some languages, using a pronoun like <em>our</em> with <em>God</em> might communicate a wrong meaning, such as:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>God belonged to Jude and his readers like a possession.</p></li><li><p>There is another god.</p></li><li><p>The fake Christians claimed to worship a different god, other than the true God.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">If saying <em>our God</em> might communicate wrong meaning (a), you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the God we worship</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God, whom we worship</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If saying <em>our God</em> might communicate wrong meaning (b) or (c), you could omit <em>our</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a license for immorality:</strong> The fake Christians acted as if they could sin freely. Some other ways this has been translated are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to excuse their immoral ways (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>an opportunity for immorality (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a reason for sexual sin (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>allows us to live immoral lives (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>immorality:</strong> The <em>immorality</em> to which Jude referred included sexual sin, but also other sins. If your language has a word, phrase, or idiom that definitely includes sexual sin but could also include other sins, it may be a good choice here.</p><h4>4f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and they deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and they deny our<sup>(incl)</sup> only Ruler and our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord, Jesus Christ.</p></li><li><p>They reject Jesus Christ, who is our<sup>(incl)</sup> only Master and our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and they deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>It is recommended that you do not use the KJV as a model for translating 4f. The KJV followed some copies of the Greek text that contain the word “God” in 4f. However, we can tell from other better copies that “God” was not part of what Jude wrote in 4f.</span></span> In 4f, Jude mentioned another way that the fake Christians showed that they did not respect God: they denied <em>Jesus Christ</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>deny:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates here as <em>deny</em> means “reject [someone] or refuse to accept [him].” Some ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>reject (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>refuse to accept (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>disowning (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The manner in which these fake Christians were denying Jesus Christ may have been:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>by what they said, in words only.</p></li><li><p>by their actions, by what they did.</p></li><li><p>by both their words and their actions.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">From what Jude wrote in this letter, it is obvious that the fake Christians denied and rejected Jesus by both their words and their actions. Therefore, it is good to use an expression that includes <u>both words and actions</u>. However, if you need to choose between words and actions, it is recommended that you refer to <u>sinful actions</u>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates here as <em>Christ</em> is part of the name, Jesus Christ, so it should be translated as a name. See Christ in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Master and Lord:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates here as <em>Master</em> described the someone over the servants or slaves, the head of a household, or a ruler with absolute authority.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Lord</em> is the word that New Testament writers normally used to speak of Jesus as leader or chief. See Lord in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The two Greek words, translated <em>Master and Lord</em>, have almost the same meaning. Jude used them together to emphasize that Jesus has total or absolute authority.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Try to find two words or phrases in your language that speak about the highest authorities. If possible, make sure that one of these is how you normally refer to Jesus as <em>Lord</em>. However, if you can find only one suitable word or phrase, then translate these two Greek words with one expression.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3–4</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">As the notes for 4a mentioned, verse 4 gives the reason for verse 3. Because of the fake Christians, Jude felt that he needed to write this letter urging his readers to defend the faith.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In many languages, it is normal to put the reason for an action first. If this is true in your language, you may need to reorder verses 3 and 4. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>4a</sup>Because certain people <sup>4b</sup>who pretend to believe have joined your group, <sup>3d</sup>I felt the need to write this letter to you <sup>3e</sup>to urge you to defend the faith….</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>4a</sup>However, certain people <sup>4b</sup>who say they believe in God, but who really do not, have joined your group. <sup>3d</sup>Therefore, I must write <sup>3e</sup>to ask you to contend for the faith….</p></blockquote><h5><strong>General Comment on 4a–f</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is more natural to reorder 4a–f, placing 4d later in the verse. There are two options:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>4d may be placed right <u>after 4b</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>4a</sup>For certain persons <sup>4b</sup>have crept in unnoticed, <sup>4d</sup>those who were long beforehand marked out for this condemnation, <sup>4c</sup>ungodly persons <sup>4e</sup>who turn the grace of our God into licentiousness <sup>4f</sup>and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ. (NASB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>4d may be placed <u>after 4f</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>4a</sup>For some <sup>4c</sup>godless people <sup>4b</sup>have slipped in unnoticed among us, <sup>4e</sup>persons who distort the message about the grace of our God in order to excuse their immoral ways, <sup>4f</sup>and who reject Jesus Christ, our only Master and Lord. <sup>4d</sup>Long ago the Scriptures predicted the condemnation they have received.

However, afterwards he destroyed those among them who did not trust in him.</p></li><li><p>Some angels had rebelled against the Lord, so he placed them in chains in a dark place until the day when he would judge them.</p></li><li><p>The people of Sodom and Gomorrah had sinned sexually, so the Lord destroyed them by fire.</p></li></ol></div><h4>5a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">The general comment at the end of the notes for 5b discusses an issue that affects 5a–b. You will want to consider this issue before you make a final decision about how to translate this verse.</p><h4>5a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Although you are fully aware of this, I want to remind you that</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Although you<sup>(plur)</sup> already know all these <span data-bnType=\"implied\">things/facts</span>, I want to remind you<sup>(plur)</sup> that/how</p></li><li><p>¶ You<sup>(plur)</sup> already know all these <span data-bnType=\"implied\">things/facts</span>, but I want you<sup>(plur)</sup> to consider that/how</p></li><li><p>¶ I want to remind you<sup>(plur)</sup> about some things/facts that you<sup>(plur)</sup> already know.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Although you are fully aware of this, I want to remind you that:</strong> Jude realized that the three examples which he used in verses 5–7 were familiar to his readers. He was careful to mention that he knew this fact, probably so that he would not offend them. Some ways to express this meaning include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I want to remind you of some things you already know: (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Although you already know all these <span data-bnType=\"implied\">things/facts</span>, I want to remind you that…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I want you to consider some <span data-bnType=\"implied\">things/facts</span> that you already know.</p></blockquote><h4>5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>after Jesus had delivered His people out of the land of Egypt,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Jesus rescued a/the people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from slavery</span> out of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the country of</span> Egypt,</p></li><li><p>The Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">once</span> freed/released <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the Israelite</span> people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from being slaves</span> and brought them out from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the land of</span> Egypt,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Jesus:</strong> There is a textual issue here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some copies of the Greek text have <u>Lord</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that the Lord, after saving a people (NASB) <em>(CEV, GW, JBP, KJV, NASB, NCV, NIV, NJB, NLT, NRSV, REB, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Other copies of the Greek text have <u>Jesus</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that Jesus, having saved the people (NET) <em>(BSB, NET; notes in NASB, NIV, NLT, NRSV, REB, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Scholars have different opinions about what Jude originally wrote. While most modern versions follow option (1) and have “Lord,” there is also strong evidence for option (2), Jesus.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NET argues the case for Jude having written “Jesus.” The NET does this in two notes at Jude 5 and another at 1 Corinthians 10:9 for “Christ.” (See Jude 5 in NET and 1 Corinthians 10:9 in NET.)</span></span> If Jude wrote “Lord,” then in this context (4f), “Lord” would refer to Jesus Christ before he became a human being.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In your translation, you can follow the major language version in your area. If you follow option (1) (“Lord”), it is recommended that you include a footnote saying that Jude may have written <em>Jesus</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>had delivered His people out of the land of Egypt:</strong> Jude referred here to the time when the Lord freed the Israelites from slavery in <em>Egypt</em> and led them away from there. This is recorded in the book of Exodus.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>had delivered:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates here as <em>delivered</em> includes these ideas:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>to free someone from something bad,</p></li><li><p>to rescue/save,</p></li><li><p>to keep someone safe.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate <em>delivered</em> include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>released</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>rescued</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>saved/freed from slavery</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His people:</strong> The phrase <em>His people</em> refers to the Israelites. The Greek word for <em>His</em> is not explicit in the text. Therefore, you do not need to translate the word <em>His</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a people (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the people (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the people of Israel (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>out of the land of Egypt:</strong> <em>Egypt</em> was the country where the Israelites had been slaves. It was from <u>slavery</u> in this country that the Lord delivered them. It may be more natural in your language to make the idea of slavery explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Lord rescued his people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from slavery, bringing them</span> out of Egypt.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Lord freed his people from Egypt <span data-bnType=\"implied\">where they were slaves</span>.</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The Greek text for verse 5 contains the word <em>hapax</em>. This Greek word can be translated literally as “once” or “once for all.” Many English versions leave it implicit (BSB, CEV, JBP, NCV, NIV, NLT).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Copies of the Greek text differ about where <em>hapax</em> is placed in this verse. This affects which verb <em>hapax</em> relates to. Two options are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It relates to the verb translated as “delivered” in 5b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lord <u>once</u> <u>saved</u> his people from Egypt. (GW) <em>(GW, NRSV, REB, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It relates to the verb translated as “fully aware” in 5a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you have been <u>fully informed</u> of these facts <u>once for all</u>. (NET) <em>(KJV, NASB, NET, NJB, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">If you translate this Greek word, it is recommended that you follow option (1). Option (1) gives a better contrast with 5c than option (2) does. Most of the English versions that do not translate <em>hapax</em> probably also follow option (1).</p></div><h4>5b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>after Jesus had delivered His people out of the land of Egypt, He destroyed those who did not believe:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates here as <em>after</em> is literally “the second” and occurs at the beginning of 5c. With this phrase, Jude indicated that the event in 5c happened <em>after</em> the Lord saved the Israelites out of Egypt. This <em>after</em> action by the Lord contrasts with the saving action he did earlier. Some versions include “but” to indicate this contrast and place the phrase at the beginning of 5c. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5b</sup>the Lord rescued the nation from Egypt, <sup>5c</sup>but afterwards he still destroyed the people who refused to believe him (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5b</sup>The Lord once saved his people from Egypt. <sup>5c</sup>But on another occasion he destroyed those who didn’t believe. (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He destroyed those who did not believe.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but later <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he</span> destroyed those <span data-bnType=\"implied\">among them</span> who did not believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in him</span>.</p></li><li><p>but afterwards <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he</span> killed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all of</span> them who did not believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in him</span>.</p></li><li><p>but later <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he</span> caused <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all</span> of those <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> who did not trust <span data-bnType=\"implied\">him</span> to die <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the desert</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He destroyed:</strong> The Lord <em>destroyed</em> some of the people whom he freed from Egypt. He <em>destroyed</em> them by causing them to die in the wilderness.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those who did not believe:</strong> The Lord destroyed <em>those</em> Israelites <em>who did not believe</em> in him. In some languages it is necessary for a verb like <em>believe</em> to have a stated object. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>did not believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in him</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>did not have faith <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in him</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>did not trust <span data-bnType=\"implied\">him</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See faith, Meaning 1, in the Glossary.</p>",

He used a special Jewish style<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>As mentioned in the Outline, this style was called “midrash.” Jewish rabbis sometimes used this text-application style of presentation.</span></span> in these verses.

This phrase would be similar to “I want to remind you” in 5a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6</sup> <u>And remember</u> the angels…. <sup>7</sup><u>Also remember</u> the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah…. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Several other English versions, including the NLT, REB, and GNT, have a phrase like this.</p><h4>6</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In verse 6, Jude gave his second example of a group that sinned against God, and as a result, suffered terrible punishments.</p><h4>6a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And the angels who did not stay within their own domain</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And <span data-bnType=\"implied\">there were</span> angels who did not keep the positions/responsibilities <span data-bnType=\"implied\">entrusted/delegated to them</span>,</p></li><li><p>In addition, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I want to remind you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the Lord punished even angels.</span> Those angels did not keep their authority/rule <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that God entrusted/delegated to them</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the angels:</strong> Here Jude referred to <em>angels</em> who had rebelled against the Lord. He did not refer to all angels, but only to those who rebelled. See angel, Meaning 2, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Many other <em>angels</em> have always obeyed God (see angel, Meaning 1, in the Glossary). In some languages, it may be necessary to make it clear that Jude was not referring to all angels. For example, it might be helpful to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>some angels</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>certain angels</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In other languages, it may be better to put this information in a footnote.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Translators should avoid using a term that implies that <em>angels</em> are the spirits of human beings, either alive or dead.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the Greek text there is no definite article (<em>the</em>) before the word for <em>angels</em>. Some scholars believe that this emphasizes the high status of <em>angels</em>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Several commentaries understand “angels” without the definite article in this case to be qualitative, emphasizing their high status, or contrasting them with the human beings described in the examples before and after (verses 5 &amp; 7). The meaning seems to be that the Lord punishes <u>even</u> angels who rebel against him. If a translator wanted to include this, then verse 6 could be started like this: “And the Lord has punished even certain angels….”</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And the very angels… (JBP)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who did not stay within their own domain:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Jude frequently used the Greek verb, <em>tēreō</em>, which the BSB translates as <em>stay</em>. He used a form of <em>tēreō</em> in 1f, 6a, 6c, 13d (where the BSB uses the verb “reserved”), and 21a. Though it was possible for Jude to use one verb in all these places, the meanings translated into natural English require the use of more than one English verb.</span></span> Here Jude described the way in which these angels had sinned. God had given authority to the angels by giving each of them certain responsibilities. The angels whom Jude mentioned here rebelled. They left their own domains, refusing to fulfill the responsibilities which God had assigned to them. Some other ways to say this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>didn’t do their work (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>refused to do their duty</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Jude did not say why these angels left their positions of authority.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Most English versions also do not state the reason (BSB, CEV, GW, JBP, KJV, NASB, NCV, NIV, NJB, NRSV, RSV).</span></span> A few English versions have indicated that they abandoned these positions because they were not content or felt limited in some way.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>English versions that indicate a reason why these angels abandoned their positions of authority are: NET, NLT, REB and GNT.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who did not stay <u>within the limits</u> of their proper authority (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who were <u>not content</u> to maintain the dominion assigned to them, (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>their own domain:</strong> In this context the Greek word <em>archē</em>, which the BSB translates as <em>domain</em> means “rule” or “positions of authority.” It indicates that these angels were in charge of something. However, they had received each <em>domain</em> from God, and they were accountable to him. You may be able to use a term that describes the kind of authority that a king or chief gives to someone else to manage his wealth or property.</p><h4>6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but abandoned their proper dwelling—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but <span data-bnType=\"implied\">instead they</span> abandoned their own <span data-bnType=\"implied\">proper</span> areas/domains.</p></li><li><p>but <span data-bnType=\"implied\">instead they</span> deserted their assigned/proper places.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates here as <em>but</em> marks <u>contrast</u>. The contrast is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6a</sup> <u>having</u> their own domain</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><em>but</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6b</sup> <u>abandoned</u> the places where they have that domain</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural to connect 6a and 6b in a different way. A conjunction like “and” would indicate connection and <u>similarity</u> between:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>6a</sup> <u>not keeping</u> their own domain</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>“and”</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>6b</sup> <u>abandoning</u> the places where they have that domain</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>didn’t do their work <u>and</u> left their proper places. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>failed in their high duties <u>and</u> abandoned their proper sphere (JBP)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>abandoned their proper dwelling:</strong> The Greek word <em>oikētērion </em>occurs only twice in the New Testament.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The only other use of <em>oikētērion</em> in the New Testament is by Paul in 2 Corinthians 5:2. There the BSB translates this word as “dwelling.” The context in 2 Corinthians is talking about the resurrection body.</span></span> Here it includes two ideas:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Its literal meaning is <u>home</u>. In this verse, it implies that the angels left their place of residence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>abandoned their own place of residence (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>abandoned their own dwelling place (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>It has an extended meaning that includes the activities that should occur at a home or place. In this context, these angels abandoned their places, including the activities that God had assigned to them to do.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Louw and Nida, classify <em>oikētērion</em> as one of the Greek words that imply “abandoned their proper dwelling.” (Subdomain E, starting at 85.67, footnote 864.)</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>abandoned their assigned place. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>abandoned their proper sphere (JBP)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The second meaning is more in focus in this context. In your translation, it will be helpful to use an expression that includes this idea.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>If your language has a word or phrase which, like <em>oikētērion</em>, can mean home or place of residence, but also implies the activities that happen there, you may be able to use it here.</span></span> Such an expression will also help to indicate that both 6a and 6b describe the way that these angels rebelled against God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>abandoned:</strong> In this context, the Greek word that the BSB translates here as <em>abandoned</em> means “left completely.” These angels left permanently. Try to avoid using a verb that would cause your readers to think that these angels left but intended to return later.</p><h4>6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>these He has kept in eternal chains under darkness,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He has kept these <span data-bnType=\"implied\">angels</span> in chains that no one can break in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a place of</span> darkness,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The Lord</span> has put these <span data-bnType=\"implied\">angels</span> in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a</span> dark <span data-bnType=\"implied\">place</span>, and he <span data-bnType=\"implied\">still</span> keeps them <span data-bnType=\"implied\">there so</span> securely that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they</span> can never free themselves.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>these:</strong> The word <em>these</em> refers to the angels about whom Jude wrote in 6a–b. The BSB has supplied the word <em>these</em> in order to help clarify that the actions in 6c–d happened to <em>these</em> angels.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He has kept in eternal chains under darkness:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Greek word that the BSB translates here as <em>under</em> can mean that these angels were <u>under the control of</u> darkness, that is, unable to escape it.</span></span> Jude did not explain what he meant by <em>darkness</em>. However, it is clear that the Lord put these angels in some kind of dark prison/place and <em>kept</em> them there. This agrees with what Jude mentioned about <em>eternal chains</em> in this verse.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be necessary to mention first that the Lord put the angels <em>under darkness</em> before saying that he kept them there. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He <span data-bnType=\"implied\">put them</span> in darkness, and he has kept them <span data-bnType=\"implied\">there</span>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">put these angels</span> in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a</span> dark <span data-bnType=\"implied\">place</span> where he <span data-bnType=\"implied\">still</span> keeps them.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>He:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Greek text of this verse does not contain either “God” or “Lord.” The English versions refer to the agent, i.e. who it was who “kept” the angels in darkness, in three different ways. <em>He</em> (BSB, GW, KJV, NASB, NET, NIV, NJB, NRSV)<em>-or-</em>the Lord (NCV)<em>-or-</em>God (CEV, JBP, NLT, REB, GNT).</span></span> The pronoun <em>He</em> refers back to “Jesus” in 5b. If it is not natural or not clear to use the pronoun <em>He</em> here, then you may say “the Lord.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Lord has kept these angels in darkness. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>has kept:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Jude frequently used the Greek verb, <em>tēreō</em>, that the BSB translates as <em>kept</em>. He used a form of <em>tēreō</em> in 1f, 6a, 6c, 13d (where the BSB uses the verb “reserved”), and 21a. Though it was possible for Jude to use one verb in all these places, the meanings translated into natural English require the use of more than one English verb.</span></span> In this verse, Jude used a play on words. The Greek verb that the BSB translates here as <em>has kept</em> is a form of the verb that was translated “stay” in 6a. In this way, Jude used a type of irony: the angels would not “keep” their proper places so the Lord <em>has kept</em> <u>them</u> in a place of punishment.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be possible to express the irony in a similar way. However, in some languages it may not be natural to use the same verb in both of these contexts. If that is true in your language, you may express the irony in another way or let it be implied by the context.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>If it is not natural to do this through the verb, the translator may be able to express irony through the use of “place,” that is, “abandoned their place” (6b) versus “place of darkness” (6c).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in eternal chains:</strong> When Jude wrote this letter, it was common to restrain prisoners. Jude used this practice to describe a spiritual reality. These angels were deprived of freedom. It was impossible for them to escape.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>chains:</strong> The <em>chains</em> used in Jude’s time were made of strong metal. In some cultures people may not be familiar with the practice of using chains to bind or restrain someone. If that is true in your culture, it may be better to use a more general expression. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>restrained</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>imprisoned</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>bound with steel</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>tied securely</p></blockquote><h4>6d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>bound for judgment on that great day.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They are</span> bound/tied <span data-bnType=\"implied\">there and waiting</span> to be judged on the great day.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He has</span> bound/tied <span data-bnType=\"implied\">them there</span> until the great day <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when he will</span> judge them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>bound:</strong> The BSB has supplied the verb <em>bound</em>. When talking about chains, <em>bound</em> is a more natural verb in English than “has kept” in 6c. The verb “has kept” in 6c applies also to 6d.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">For some languages, it is more natural to use an active verb and specify <u>who</u> imprisoned the angels. The note for “he” in 6c explains that <u>the Lord</u> imprisoned them in this way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>he</u> has bound them…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for judgment on that great day:</strong> The Lord has imprisoned these angels in darkness until the time comes for them to be judged. This will happen on what Jude called <em>that great day</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word that the BSB translates here as <em>for</em> can refer to time. In this case, it can mean <u>until</u> the great Day. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>until the judgment of the great day. (RSV, JBP)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NJB has the same wording, but capitalizes the D of Day, that is, “the great Day.”</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>until the great day of judgment. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>waiting for the day of judgment. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>judgment:</strong> The outcome of this <em>judgment</em> was not in doubt. The <em>judgment</em> which Jude referred to here included condemnation and punishment for rebelling against God. In some languages, it may be better to use a more specific word, like “condemned.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that great Day on which they will be condemned. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>that great day:</strong> The phrase <em>that great day</em> refers to the <em>day</em> when Christ will deliver the final judgment on angels and people. In other places in the Bible, this day is referred to as, “the great and glorious day of the Lord” (Acts 2:20), and “the great day of God Almighty” (Revelation 16:14).</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6a–e</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be clearer to reorder this verse. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6a</sup>And <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the Lord punished certain</span> angels. <sup>6c</sup>He has put them in a dark <span data-bnType=\"implied\">place</span>, and he keeps them there in everlasting chains, <sup>6d</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">waiting</span> to be judged on the great Day. <sup>6a</sup>These are the angels who did not keep their positions of authority. <sup>6b</sup>Instead <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they</span> abandoned their place.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In 6c, the note on “has kept” explains that Jude expressed irony through his use of the same Greek verb. If it is not natural to do this through the verb, the translator may be able to express irony through use of “place,” that is, “abandoned their place” (6b) versus “place of darkness” (6c).</span></span></p></blockquote></div>",

However, afterwards he destroyed those among them who did not trust in him.</p></li><li><p>Some angels had rebelled against the Lord, so he placed them in chains in a dark place until the day when he would judge them.</p></li><li><p>The people of Sodom and Gomorrah had sinned sexually, so the Lord destroyed them by fire.</p></li></ol></div><h4>7</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(BSB:) In like manner, Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, who indulged in sexual immorality and pursued strange flesh, are on display as an example of those who sustain the punishment of eternal fire.</strong></p></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In verse 7, Jude gave a third example of a group who sinned against God, and as a result, suffered terrible punishment. The people of Sodom and Gomorrah sinned sexually. The Lord destroyed them by fire.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be helpful to use an introductory phrase<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>As mentioned in the note for 6–7, this is also true for the start of verse 6.</span></span> at the beginning of verse 7. You may use a phrase that is similar to the phrase, “I want to remind you,” in 5a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The notes for verse 7 are based on a <u>literal</u> translation of the Greek text, instead of on the BSB. (Notice the abbreviation “lit.” before the words and phrases in the notes below.) Some of the parts of the verse have been reordered to give the notes a more natural order for English. The letters of the verse parts will follow the new order, which is indicated here:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7a</sup>In a similar way to these, <sup>7b</sup>Sodom and Gomorrah and the towns around them <sup>7c</sup>are exhibited as an example of eternal fire, <sup>7d</sup>the penalty they experience, <sup>7e</sup>having committed sexual sin and gone after different flesh.</p></blockquote><h4>7a (reordered)</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(lit:) In a similar way to these,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Like these <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people and angels</span>,</p></li><li><p>Consider/Remember <span data-bnType=\"implied\">another example,</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">which is</span> similar to these <span data-bnType=\"implied\">unbelieving Israelites and the angels who rebelled</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Verse 7 begins with the Greek word, <em>hōs</em>. It can be translated in a variety of ways, including “that” and “how.” In this context Jude used <em>hōs</em> to mark the beginning of this third example of punishment for sin.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Lenski (page 621) thought that Jude used <em>hos</em> here, instead of the <em>hoti</em> (5a) that governs both 5 and 6, because the evidence of what had happened to Sodom and Gomorrah could still be seen. The examples in 5 and 6 were known <u>only</u> through their stories being written or told. However, Jude’s readers could still find evidence of God’s punishment of Sodom and Gomorrah at the south end of the Dead Sea. As the Greek present tense verb <em>prokeintai</em> implies, Sodom and Gomorrah are an example that has observable evidence.</span></span> It indicates that it should be considered along with the first two examples in verse 5 and verse 6. Some ways to express this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Also consider that…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You also know how…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I want to remind you that…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(lit.) In a similar way to these:</strong> In order to translate verse 7, a translator must decide two issues of interpretation:</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><u>Issue 1</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Scholars have different opinions about who <em>these</em> refers to. The two main possibilities are:<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Two other interpretations that are sometimes suggested are:(3) It refers to either the men of Sodom and Gomorrah or to the men of the surrounding towns, one of these groups being compared to the other.(4) It refers to the fake Christians (verse 4).In the Greek text, “these” is marked for both gender and number as <u>masculine</u> and <u>plural</u>. Interpretation (3) is unlikely because the Greek words for “Sodom and Gomorrah” and also for “towns” are not masculine. While some scholars suggest that “these” refers to the men in the towns, there is no compelling reason to assume this. It would require Jude to have linked the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah with the sin of the surrounding towns in a very indirect and unnecessarily complicated way. Finally, interpretation (4) is not correct. In verse 8, Jude definitely wrote about the same fake Christians as in verse 4. If “these” in verse 7 also referred to these same people, then Jude would have been repeating himself in verse 8 for no apparent reason.</span></span></p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to both the angels whom Jude mentioned in verse 6 and to the Israelites who did not believe and were destroyed (verse 5).</p></li><li><p>It refers to just the angels (verse 6).</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Greek grammar would allow either interpretation,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In the Greek text, “these” is marked for both gender and number as <u>masculine</u> and <u>plural</u>. “Angels” is the closest preceding noun that is marked as <u>masculine</u> and <u>plural</u>. The unbelieving Israelites are also marked as <u>masculine</u> and <u>plural</u>.</span></span> but interpretation (1) is more likely because the conjunction used to join verses 5 and 6 indicates a close relationship between these verses. If there is a natural way to include both the angels and unbelieving Israelites in your translation, then it is recommended that you use it here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In a similar way to these <span data-bnType=\"implied\">unbelieving Israelites and angels</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><u>Issue 2</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Another interpretation issue is to decide in what way the people of Sodom and Gomorrah (7b) were <em>similar</em> to the preceding two groups,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This assumes that interpretation (1) above is correct.</span></span> which were:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>the angels who rebelled (verse 6),</p></li><li><p>the unbelieving Israelites (verse 5).</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The two main possibilities are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The three groups were <em>similar</em> because <u>all were examples and warnings</u> that the Lord punishes sinners.

(CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What happened to Sodom and Gomorrah…is <u>an example</u>…of the punishment…. The people of these cities <u>suffered the same fate that</u> God’s people and the angels did…. (GW) <em>(CEV, GW, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The sexual sin committed by the people of Sodom and Gomorrah, was <em>similar</em> <u>in nature</u> to the sins that the angels<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Scholars who accept this view interpret Genesis 6:1–4 as talking about angelic beings taking human wives. No clear biblical evidence exists that angels are capable of having sexual relations with human beings or that angels and human beings have had children together.</span></span> and the unbelieving Israelites<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>While the Israelites who left Egypt did commit sexual sin (Exodus 32:6, Numbers 25:1), verse 5 probably referred to what happened to the Israelites who refused to follow the advice of Joshua and Caleb. They died in the desert because they refused to enter the land that God was giving to them.</span></span> had committed. According to this interpretation, Jude used three examples of sexual sin. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Sodom and Gomorrah…which, <u>in the same manner as they</u>, indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural lust… (NRSV<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>It is possible that the NRSV is comparing the people of Sodom and Gomorrah only to the angels, and not to the Israelites that Jude mentioned. Other English versions that clearly compare the people of Sodom and Gomorrah to the angels but not to the Israelites, are the NET, REB and GNT. All four of these versions imply that Jude was indicating sexual immorality as a similarity between the people of Sodom and Gomorrah and the angels.</span></span>) <em>(NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><h4>7b (reordered)</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(lit:) Sodom and Gomorrah and the towns around them,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighboring towns</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">What happened to the people of</span> Sodom and Gomorrah and the towns near <span data-bnType=\"implied\">them</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(lit.)

God destroyed these cities with fire because of the sexually immoral behavior of the people who lived there. You may read about this in Genesis 18:20–22, 19:1–29.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It was not just the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah themselves (with the buildings and possessions) that were destroyed. All the <u>people</u> who lived there were killed. In some languages it may help to make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the people of</span> Sodom and Gomorrah</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(lit.) and the towns around them:</strong> This phrase refers to the towns near Sodom and Gomorrah that God destroyed at the same time.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The names of two of these towns were Admah and Zeboiim (Deuteronomy 29:23).

What happened to the people of Sodom and Gomorrah was an <em>example</em> and warning that sinful people will be punished by eternal fire in hell. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>are a warning of the eternal fire that will punish all who are evil. (NLT) <em>(GW, JBP, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Eternal fire relates primarily to the word <u>penalty</u> in 7d. Sodom and Gomorrah and the towns were experiencing the penalty of eternal <em>fire</em>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Many scholars who accept interpretation (2) do <u>not</u> think that Jude meant the eternal fire of <u>hell</u>.

(NJB) <em>(BSB, KJV, NASB, NCV, NET, NJB, REB, RSV, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek grammar of this verse allows for either or both to be correct. It is recommended that, if possible, you translate as if both interpretations<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Jude and his readers were very aware that these cities were destroyed by fire.

However, if you must choose between them, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), which has more support in the commentaries.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The following examples show how this verse may be translated with both interpretations.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Like these <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people and angels</span>, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns are a warning of eternal fire, the penalty they suffer <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because</span> they committed sexual sin and went after different flesh.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In a similar way to these <span data-bnType=\"implied\">unbelieving Israelites and angels,</span> Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns are exhibited as an example <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the punishment</span> of eternal fire. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Their people</span> suffer the penalty <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of eternal fire</span>, because they committed sexual sin and went after different flesh.</p></blockquote><h4>7c (reordered)</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(lit:) are exhibited as an example of eternal fire,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>warn <span data-bnType=\"implied\">us</span> of eternal fire,</p></li><li><p>is an apparent warning <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the punishment</span> of eternal fire.</p></li><li><p>is a warning which is plain to see that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">sinful people will be punished by</span> eternal fire.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(lit.) are exhibited as an example:</strong> Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they are an apparent/clear example.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they…are now displayed as an example.

They were guilty of sexual sin. Their sexual immorality was so bad that God caused them and their cities to be destroyed. Some ways to indicate this reason are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>because</u> they committed sexual sins and… (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>since</u> they indulged in sexual immorality and… (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Jude was probably referring to sexual sin that the people of Sodom and Gomorrah did regularly. It was the habit of these people to sin sexually. If your language normally marks habitual action, you may do so here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">habitually/regularly</span> committed sexual sin</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>(lit.) having committed sexual sin:</strong> This phrase is a literal translation of one Greek word. It could refer to any kind of sexual sin. Look for the most natural way in your language to refer to <em>sexual sin</em> <u>in general</u>, rather than to a specific type of sexual sin.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>(lit.) gone after different flesh:</strong> Pursuing <em>different flesh</em> was the way that Jude referred to homosexual acts;<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Scholars have different opinions concerning what sin Jude described as “having <em>gone after different flesh</em>.” The main interpretations are:(1) It refers to <u>homosexual acts</u>; that is, men having sex with men.(2) It refers to <u>bestiality</u>.(3) It refers to the men of Sodom trying to have <u>sex with</u> the two <u>angels</u> who visited Lot (Genesis chapter 19).It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Many scholars say that this going <em>after different flesh</em> was <u>homosexual acts</u>, and they are probably correct.The last interpretation is unlikely, because God had already decided to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding town before the incident with the angels at Lot’s house happened. Also, only the men of <u>Sodom</u> tried to have sex with the angels, and God destroyed more than Sodom. In addition, there is no evidence that the men of Sodom knew that the two visitors to Lot’s house were angels. Another reason to reject this last opinion is that Jude said that these men went after different “flesh,” and angels are spirit beings who do not have “flesh.”</span></span> that is, men having sex with other men. Some ways that English versions have translated this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>engaged in homosexual activities. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>indulged in unnatural lust (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sexual relations that God does not allow. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Languages often have more than one way to refer to this type of sexual activity. Look for the most natural way in your language that is suitable for reading in worship meetings where people of all ages and both sexes may be present. See flesh in the Glossary.</p>",

This word helps to show how verse 8 relates to verses 5–7. Normally, it means “nevertheless.” In some languages this meaning may be implied without a connector, so some translations have left the connection implicit. In other languages a connecting word or phrase may help to make the connection clear.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other ways to translate <em>mentoi</em> here are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nevertheless…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Even though they know these things…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Despite knowing about these examples/warnings…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the same way:</strong> The fake Christians whom Jude wrote about in verse 4 sinned in a manner which was similar to the three examples in verses 5–7.

Look for the most natural way in your language to indicate that <em>these dreamers</em> refers to the same people as the “certain men” (BSB) in verse 4.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It is the same with <u>these people who have entered your group</u>.

They thought that these dreams gave them the authority to sin in the ways that Jude mentioned in this verse. However, these dreams were not really from God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways that English versions have expressed this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as a result of their dreams (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who claim authority from their dreams (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>defile their bodies,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>contaminate/defile their bodies <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with sexual sin</span>,</p></li><li><p>They sin sexually,</p></li><li><p>they use their bodies to sin,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>defile their bodies:</strong> Most scholars agree that <em>defile their bodies</em> refers to sexual sin. This phrase is a figure of speech. Jude was not saying that <em>their bodies</em> were physically dirty. Instead he meant that their sexual sin had made them spiritually impure. Because these people sinned sexually, they were similar to the people of Sodom and Gomorrah (verse 7).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If your language has a similar idiom that associates “being dirty” with “sin,” especially sexual sin, then you may be able to use it here. However, in some languages an expression like “dirty with sin” might simply mean that these people were physically dirty and that they had sinned. If this is true in your language, then you may:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use an idiom that has the correct meaning in your language.</p></li><li><p>Use a descriptive phrase with the correct meaning.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>reject the Lord’s authority (GW) <em>(GW, NCV, NET note, NJB, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Jude meant <em>authority</em> <u>in general</u>, including <u>human</u> authority. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>reject all authority (CEV) <em>(CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Many English versions do not specify what kind of <em>authority</em> Jude meant. Jude probably intended interpretation (1), that these people rejected the Lord’s <em>authority</em>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The discussion of Jude 8 in the UBS Handbook points out: “The word for ‘authority,’ <em>kuriotēta</em>, is related to the word for Lord, <em>kurios</em>. It is likely therefore that <em>reject authority</em> here is equivalent in meaning to ‘deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ’ in verse 4f.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages require a translator to specify whose <em>authority</em> or what type of authority Jude meant. If you need to be specific in your translation, it is recommended that you specify:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Lord’s authority<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NET has this note: “Most likely, the authority of the Lord is in view. This verse, then, echoes the indictment of v. 4: ‘they deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.’”</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, if you have a suitable way in your language to refer to all types of <em>authority</em>, including divine <em>authority</em>, you may use it here.</p><h4>8d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and slander glorious beings.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and scorn <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his</span> glories.</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they</span> lie against/about our<sup>(incl)</sup> glorious Lord.</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they</span> usurp/assume the Lord’s authority.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>slander:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates here as <em>slander</em> is literally “blaspheme.” “Blaspheme” means to insult someone in a way that could injure their reputation.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In English, “blaspheme” would generally apply to a deity, and “slander” to other personal beings, such as angels, human beings, and possibly Jesus according to his human nature.</span></span> It is often used to refer to evil or irreverent statements about God, divine beings, or holy things.

If 1 Peter and 2 Peter have a common author, then it can be assumed that divine attributes are meant in 2 Peter 2:10, and also in the parallel passage, Jude 8.</span></span> that the BSB translates here as <em>glorious beings</em> is literally the noun “glories.” Scholars have different opinions concerning what Jude meant by “glories.” Two different interpretations are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to the glories of Jesus Christ; that is, to what he has done and to what he is like in his splendor and excellence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his glory (GW) <em>(GW, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to angels, or to some type of angel.

See also glory, Meaning 3, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In modern English it is more natural to use the singular form of the noun “glory.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>English versions of 1 Peter 1:11 often translate the plural noun <em>doxas</em> by singular noun “glory” (GW, KJV, NCV, NET, NLT, NRSV, RSV, GNT).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Lord’s glory</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 8d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Jude did not specify exactly what these fake Christians did. They probably claimed that they spoke with the Lord’s authority. Actually, they opposed his true will by lying in order to justify their evil actions. (See the notes on “these dreamers” and “dreamers” in 8a.)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In this way, the fake Christians spoke falsely about the Lord and insulted him. They may also have usurped his authority by passing judgment on other people in his name, or by opposing those who taught the truth.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The situation that Jude most likely referred to was that the fake Christians “blasphemed glories” by speaking <u>with authority that belonged only to the Lord</u>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This seems even more likely when verse 9 is considered, as well as 2 Peter 2:11.

The devil said that Michael did not have the right to take the body and bury it. The devil argued that he himself could claim the body.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The devil argued that he had a right to claim Moses’ body, because Moses had murdered an Egyptian.</span></span> However, Michael refused to give the body to the devil.

Some ways to translate <em>archangel</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>leading angel</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>chief angel</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>leader of God’s angels</p></blockquote><h4>9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>when he disputed with the devil over the body of Moses,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>when he argued/contended with the devil about <span data-bnType=\"implied\">which of them had the right to take</span> the body of Moses,</p></li><li><p>When he disputed with the devil about <span data-bnType=\"implied\">whether it was right for Michael to take</span> the body of Moses <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and bury it</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">The general comment at the end of the notes for 9d shows a way in which the parts of this verse may be reordered. Putting 9b at the end of the verse may be more natural in some languages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>when he disputed with the devil over the body of Moses:</strong> Michael and <em>the devil</em> disputed about which of them had a right to take <em>the body of Moses</em>. For more detail, see the introductory note at the beginning of verse 9.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>disputed:</strong> The Greek text has two verbs here in 9b that express almost the same idea. The text is literally:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when with the devil <u>disputing</u>, he was <u>arguing</u> about the body of Moses.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The two Greek verbs were often used when talking about legal disputes. They do not simply mean that Michael and Satan quarreled. If your language has terms for a disagreement concerning the law, then it may be appropriate to use them here. The term(s) you select should not imply that Michael and the devil fought physically.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Since the two Greek verbs have almost the same meaning,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>English versions that translate each of the two Greek verbs separately include: GW, JBP, KJV, NASB, NET, NRSV, RSV, GNT.

Nor does the text imply that Michael was afraid of the devil. Rather, it meant that Michael refused to use authority which belonged only to the Lord. Another way to say this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>did not dare to condemn him…<span data-bnType=\"implied\">by</span> judging the devil.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to bring a slanderous charge:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>to bring a slanderous charge</em> is literally, “to pronounce a judgment of blasphemy.” Scholars have different opinions about who was blaspheming here and against whom the blasphemy was made. Three ways to interpret this phrase are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means that Michael did not dare to judge the devil or condemn him. Only the Lord had that authority. If Michael had done it, that would have been <u>blasphemy against the Lord</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Michael didn’t dare to hand down a judgment against the devil.

(GNT) <em>(BSB, CEV, JBP, KJV, NASB, NIV, NJB, REB, RSV, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It implies that <u>the devil had committed slander</u> (“blasphemy”), probably against Moses,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Jude contrasted the fake Christians in verse 8 with the archangel Michael, not the devil. The similar passage, 2 Peter 2:11, uses the adjectival form of the word “blasphemy.” Therefore, it is more likely that 2 Peter speaks of a “blasphemous judgment,” not a “judgment <u>for</u> blasphemy.” If the point of comparison is similar in Jude, this favors interpretation (1) over interpretation (3).</span></span> but Michael did not dare to accuse him. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Michael…did not dare accuse Satan of blasphemy. (NLT) <em>(NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).

Jude compared them with well-known individuals and groups mentioned in the Old Testament and in other Jewish writings. He also used things found in nature to describe their sinful ways. Through these examples, he explained that these fake Christians deserved the punishment which they would receive.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1066001008\" data-endVerseId=\"1066001010\"><h3>Paragraph 8–10</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, Jude wrote that the fake Christians (verse 4) had sinned in ways which were similar to the examples of sin in verses 5–7. Jude added another example to show how evil and unwise these people were (verse 9). He then said that they were like unthinking animals (verse 10).</p></div><h4>10</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In this verse, there is a contrast between 10a and 10b–c.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In the Greek text of this verse, there is a <em>men</em>-<em>de</em> relationship between 10a and 10b–c. In English, <em>men</em>-<em>de</em> is often defined as “on the one hand”…“on the other hand.” None of the English versions make this explicit in their translation. This form, when used in English, usually marks some kind of contrast. In this verse, however, both the <em>men</em> and the <em>de</em> reinforce Jude’s point, that is, the sinfulness of the fake Christians. The contrast relates to their response to what (<em>men</em>) they <u>do not</u> understand (10a) and to what (<em>de</em>) they <u>do</u> understand (10b–c). In both cases they act sinfully.</span></span> This contrast is between the response of the fake Christians to what they <u>did not understand</u> and their response to what they <u>did understand</u>. Be sure to express this contrast clearly in your translation.</p><h4>10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>These men, however, slander what they do not understand,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But these men speak disrespectfully against those things they do not understand,</p></li><li><p>These people, however, scorn/do-not-respect whatever <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and whomever</span> they do not understand.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>These men, however:</strong> The Greek pronoun that the BSB translates as <em>These men</em> refers here to the fake Christians whom Jude mentioned in verses 4 and 8a. This pronoun did not necessarily refer only to males. Many English versions use a more general expression. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But these people… (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">For another note that talks about this matter, see “certain men” in 4a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>however:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates here as <em>however</em> indicates a contrast between this verse and verse 9. In this verse, Jude contrasted the sinful ways of the fake Christians with Michael (verse 9), who respected the Lord. Jude described these people as being like unthinking animals.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>slander:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates here as <em>slander</em> is literally “blaspheme.” Forms of this word were also used in 8d and 9c, where the BSB translates them as “slander” and “slanderous.” Here in verse 10, the word is used in a general way. It should be translated with a general expression that could apply to either God or people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In English, “blaspheme” would generally apply to a deity, and “slander” to other personal beings, such as angels, human beings, and possibly Jesus according to his human nature.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>speak against</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>speak disrespectfully about</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>slight</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>what they do not understand:</strong> Jude was probably not referring here to any one thing in particular that these people did not understand.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>English versions that support this interpretation include: BSB, GW, JBP, NASB, NIV, NJB, NRSV, REB, RSV, GNT.</span></span> The people spoke against <u>anything</u> that they did <em>not understand</em>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The CEV disagrees. It seems to say that Jude was speaking specifically about the insulting of angels (see also verse 8 in the CEV, specifically 8d). Here in 10a, the CEV says: “But these people insult powers they don’t know anything about.”</span></span> For example, they did not understand the Lord, the gospel message, divine authority, morality, and many other things.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The fake Christians probably claimed to have special knowledge, perhaps from their dreams. Here and later in this verse, Jude disagreed with their claim to have special understanding.</span></span> Ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But these people abuse anything they do not understand (NJB).</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But these people mock and curse the things they do not understand (NLT).</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>These people, however, speak disrespectfully against whatever <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and whomever</span> they do not understand.</p></blockquote><h4>10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and like irrational animals,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and the things they do understand by instinct, as senseless/dumb animals <span data-bnType=\"implied\">understand things</span>,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">But</span> like dumb animals, they know/understand some things that they do not have to think about.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>like irrational animals:</strong> In general, <em>animals</em> do not reason or think about most things. They follow their natural desires. If they are hungry, they eat. If they are tired, they sleep. If it is time to mate, then they mate. Jude was implying that some of the desires that these people followed were sinful desires. They followed these desires without thinking about the consequences of their actions. The note on 10c discusses this further.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to say this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>like senseless animals (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>like animals that do not reason</p></blockquote><h4>10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>they will be destroyed by the things they do instinctively.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">by doing</span> these same things they destroy <span data-bnType=\"implied\">themselves</span>.</p></li><li><p>When they do these <span data-bnType=\"implied\">sinful</span> things <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that they do know/understand</span>, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">these sinful men cause the Lord to</span> destroy/judge them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they will be destroyed by the things they do instinctively:</strong> Jude indicates that these fake Christians were destroying themselves by doing the things that they knew by instinct. They probably did this by following their instincts in sinful ways, such as by committing sexual sins or gluttony. By such actions, they would cause the Lord to destroy them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>they will be destroyed:</strong> There is implied information here about the way that these people would be destroyed. Their sinful actions would cause <u>the Lord</u> to judge and punish them. The destruction would not be only the natural results of their actions, such as troubles or disease. In some languages it may be necessary to make the Lord’s role explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>10b–c</sup>and when like animals they act on what they do understand by instinct, they <span data-bnType=\"implied\">cause the Lord to</span> destroy them.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the things they do instinctively:</strong> Although there are many <em>things</em> that the fake Christians did not understand (10a), Jude said that they did understand some things. They understood these things <em>instinctively</em>. The things people do <em>instinctively</em> include natural urges like eating, sleeping, and having sexual relations.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>instinctively:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates here as <em>instinctively</em> refers to what people naturally know to do. They understand these things, because doing them is according to their nature.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages may not have a single word for <em>instinctively</em>. If this is true in your language, you may be able to say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>without thinking</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>according to their natural way(s)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Animals live <em>instinctively</em>, so Jude compared what these fake Christians do to animals, as described in the next note.</p>",

These three men were Cain, Balaam, and Korah. They were famous because they had sinned greatly. Jude used these three men to show that the Lord would condemn the fake Christians, because they had sinned like these three men had sinned. Jude also illustrated the wickedness of the fake Christians by comparing them to objects from nature (verses 12–13).</p></div><h4>11</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In this verse, Jude used a style of writing called a “woe oracle.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Woe oracles are common in the Old Testament and in the Gospels.

Instead, they make the connection implicit. If you translate <em>hoti</em>, try to make it clear that it connects 11a with 11b–d, not just with 11b. The NJB shows one way to translate this connection:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>11a</sup>Alas for them, <sup>11b–d</sup>because they have followed Cain…. (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>They have traveled the path of Cain:</strong> In the Bible, words like <em>path</em>, “road,” or “way” often refer to the type of life that a person lives, that is, to his behavior. So <em>They have traveled the path of Cain</em> means:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they have chosen to behave like Cain.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In Genesis chapter 4, Cain and his brother Abel offered sacrifices to God. God accepted Abel’s sacrifice, but he did not accept Cain’s sacrifice. Because of this, Cain became very angry and murdered his brother. Although Cain’s sin of murder was emphasized, he became known more generally to the Jews as someone who was selfish and who led others to sin.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Cain is mentioned in the New Testament in 1 John 3:12 as an example that we should not follow. Non-biblical Jewish literature also used Cain as an example of sinful behavior.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Jude used Cain as an example of someone who sinned throughout his life, so your translation should not be too specific. A translation should not say or imply that Jude was referring only to Cain’s murder of his brother Abel. The idea here is of a lifetime of sin. Ways to say this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because they behave/live <span data-bnType=\"implied\">wickedly</span> like Cain did.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because they sin the way Cain did.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If the people who will read your translation do not know who Cain is, you can tell them more about him in a footnote or perhaps in a glossary.</p><h4>11c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>they have rushed headlong into the error of Balaam;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>they have eagerly <span data-bnType=\"implied\">sinned</span> like Balaam sinned <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because they are greedy</span> for money <span data-bnType=\"implied\">too</span>,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Because they are greedy</span> for money like Balaam <span data-bnType=\"implied\">was</span>, they have eagerly made the same mistake that he made.</p></li><li><p>They have hastily made the same mistake that Balaam made <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of leading other people to sin</span> in order to make money.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they have rushed headlong:</strong> The fake Christians were eager to get what they wanted, and this made them very willing to sin.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Several English versions use <em>rushed</em> to describe the complete willingness of these fake Christians to sin in order to get what they wanted (BSB, GW, JBP, NASB, NIV).</span></span> In fact, the Greek expression literally indicates that they were “carried along” by the sin. This is a figure of speech, and in some languages there may be other figures to express this idea.

Because he wanted money, Balaam made a new plan. He told the enemies of the Israelites to send their women to seduce the Israelite men to sin sexually and worship idols (Numbers chapter 25 and Numbers 31:16). Many Israelite men sinned with these women. Later, the Israelites killed Balaam (Numbers 31:8).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>error:</strong> Balaam’s greed caused his <em>error</em>. His error was sinful, not an error that he made by accident.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for money they have given themselves to doing the wrong that Balaam did.

Other ways to say this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they have…destroyed themselves (GW, JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they have been ruined by the same rebellion as Korah—and share the same fate. (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Lord is the one who would punish the fake Christians, but this verse focuses on their sinful actions. However, in some languages it may be more natural to use a passive verb.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For translators working in a language that does not use passive verbs, it is especially appropriate to use a reflexive translation like “they have destroyed themselves.” Such a translation would not require a translator to specify “the Lord” or “God” as an agent, thus shifting the focus of the verse away from the motivation and actions of the fake Christians. None of the English versions used in these Notes have changed the expression to an active one in such a way.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they will…be destroyed (CEV, NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they will…perish (NET, NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>have perished:</strong> Jude spoke here as though they had already been destroyed or <em>perished</em>. However, he did not mean that the fake Christians had <u>already</u> been punished or had died. Instead, the verb form he used indicates that they had <u>made their destruction certain</u><span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The thought is similar to the English idiomatic expression, “They are as good as dead.”</span></span> by disobeying God. In some languages it may be more natural to use a future tense. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And like Korah, they will perish because of their rebellion. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in Korah’s rebellion:</strong> <em>Korah</em>, along with some other Israelite men, led a <em>rebellion</em> against Moses and Aaron (Numbers chapter 16). By rebelling against the leaders whom God had chosen, <em>Korah</em> and his followers were rebelling against God himself.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>God gave just Aaron and his sons the privilege of being priests, and God assigned just the Levites to serve in his house. <em>Korah</em> and his followers rebelled, by saying that Israelites from other tribes and families could also do these things.</span></span> God destroyed the leaders of this <em>rebellion</em> by causing the earth to open up and “swallow” them alive. He also sent fire from heaven to destroy the people who followed <em>Korah</em> and the other leaders.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>rebellion:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>rebellion</em> does not refer to an armed or military conflict. Instead, it refers to disobedience. Korah <u>disobeyed</u> the Lord and also led other people to disobey him. The fake Christians that Jude wrote about also disobeyed the Lord and influenced others to disobey him.</p>",

The Greek pronoun that the BSB translates here as <em>These men</em> did not necessarily refer only to males. Many English versions use a more general expression. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>These people… (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They… (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Other notes that discuss this matter are “certain men” in 4a and “these men” in 10a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>are hidden reefs:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates here as <em>hidden reefs</em> is used here as a figure of speech. Scholars have interpreted the word in two different ways in this context:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>dangerous rocks or reefs</u>. Jude compared the fake Christians to rocks or reefs <em>hidden</em> in the water that are dangerous to ships that might come too close and hit them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>These men are dangerous reefs at your love feasts. (NET) <em>(BSB, JBP, NASB, NET, NJB, NLT, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to <u>dirty spots or stains</u>. Jude indicated that the behavior of the fake Christians at the love feasts disgraced or dishonored the true Christians. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>With their shameless carousing they are like dirty spots in your fellowship meals. (GNT) <em>(CEV, GW, KJV, NCV, NIV, NRSV, RSV, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Both interpretations are possible. You may want to use the same interpretation that the Bible of the major language in your area uses. It is recommended that you place the other interpretation in a footnote.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>hidden reefs:</strong> In some cultures, where people live far from the sea, they may not understand clearly how rocks in the sea would be dangerous. If this illustration would not be clear to your readers, here are other options:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use a different figure of speech that readers in your culture will understand to mean dangerous.</p></li><li><p>Translate without using a figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They are a dangerous hazard. (NJB)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>love feasts:</strong> Early in the history of the church, Christians gathered together often and had a meal. At these meals they celebrated the Lord’s Supper<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some passages in the New Testament that speak about the Lord’s Supper are: Matthew 26:26–30, Mark 14:22–26, Luke 22:19–20, I Corinthians 10:15–16, I Corinthians 11:23–26.</span></span> (sometimes referred to as the Eucharist or Communion). They called these meals <em>love feasts</em>. Other ways to say this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>fellowship meals (NLT, GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>special Christian meals you share (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See love, Meaning 2, in the Glossary.</p><h4>12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>shamelessly feasting with you</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>When they eat with you,<sup>(plur)</sup> they are bold and do not feel ashamed.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Even though they act shamefully</span> at these meals, they do not feel afraid or ashamed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of their shameful actions</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>shamelessly feasting with you:</strong> This refers to the attitude of the fake Christians. In this context, the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>shamelessly</em> expresses two aspects of their attitude:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>They were not ashamed, even though they should have felt ashamed.</p></li><li><p>They were without fear. They were bold, even though they should have felt afraid.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Scholars have different opinions about how this Greek word relates to the other parts of this verse. There are two possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is connected to the first part of 12b, <em>feasting with you</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They eat with you and don’t feel ashamed. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they eat in your company without a qualm. (JBP) <em>(BSB, GW, JBP, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, NRSV, REB, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is connected to 12c, “shepherds who are <u>shepherding only themselves</u>.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12b</sup>…and quite shamelessly <sup>12c</sup> only looking after themselves. (NJB) <em>(KJV, NJB, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), as most English versions do. The fake Christians behaved badly at the fellowship meals. They should have felt ashamed of how they acted, but they did not feel ashamed. Their behavior showed that they did not respect the love feasts as a time of fellowship. It also showed that they did not respect the real Christians with whom they ate, or God.</p><h4>12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but shepherding only themselves.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They are like</span> shepherds who only feed themselves <span data-bnType=\"implied\">but neglect their sheep</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They</span> are like shepherds who only take care of themselves; <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they do not help other people</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They care for no one but themselves, like</span> shepherds who only benefit themselves <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and do not tend the sheep</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but shepherding only themselves:</strong> Leaders of the Christian church were often called “shepherds.” Jude implied that the fake Christians were leaders in the church to which Jude wrote. Instead of <em>shepherding</em> the real believers by teaching them the truth from God’s word, they were only interested in gaining benefit for <em>themselves</em>. This description of the fake Christians is similar to Ezekiel 34:2 where God said:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Disaster is in store for the shepherds of Israel who feed themselves! Are not shepherds meant to feed a flock? (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">“Shepherds” is a figure of speech that is commonly used in the Bible, so you will want to use it in your translation. In this context it is used as a metaphor. You may need to look for ways to make this metaphor clearer in your language: Here are some possibilities:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the shepherd metaphor, but use a verb like “look after” or “take care of,” instead of <em>shepherding</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They are shepherds who only take care only of themselves. (REB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a simile instead of a metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They are <u>like</u> shepherds who only take care of themselves.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Add implied information to indicate the specific way in which these people were like the selfish shepherds. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Like</span> shepherds who only feed themselves <span data-bnType=\"implied\">but do not feed their sheep, these people only help themselves, not other people.</span></p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>12d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>They are clouds without water, carried along by the wind;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They are <span data-bnType=\"implied\">useless, like</span> clouds that do not produce rain <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because</span> the wind blows them <span data-bnType=\"implied\">past/away</span>.</p></li><li><p>They are <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> clouds that the wind blows over <span data-bnType=\"implied\">dry/thirsty land</span> without <span data-bnType=\"implied\">giving any</span> rain. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">They promise much, but give nothing.</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>clouds without water, carried along by the wind:</strong> The area of the world in which Jude’s readers lived was dry. People needed rain to grow food and to have <em>water</em> for them and their animals to drink. Sometimes <em>clouds</em> appeared, but no rain fell. The <em>wind</em> blew the clouds along quickly, and they passed over without any rain falling. Such clouds were useless and disappointing.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Proverbs 25:14 says, “Like <u>clouds</u> and <u>wind without rain</u> is a man who boasts of gifts he does not give” (NIV).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">These fake Christians also were useless and disappointing. Jude compared them to <em>clouds without water</em>, because they did nothing to help the real Christians to whom Jude wrote.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages this figure of speech may not express this meaning. In that case, it may be necessary to indicate the meaning by adding implied information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They are <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> clouds which the wind blows <span data-bnType=\"implied\">over dry land</span> without rain falling. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">They promise much but produce/give nothing.</span></p></blockquote><h4>12e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>fruitless trees in autumn, twice dead after being uprooted.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They are like</span> trees at harvest time that have no fruit. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Like trees that have been</span> uprooted, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they are</span> completely dead.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They are as useless as fruit</span> trees that have no fruit at harvest time. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Like</span> uprooted <span data-bnType=\"implied\">fruit trees</span> they cannot produce/do anything good.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>fruitless trees in autumn:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>autumn</em> probably referred to late <em>autumn</em>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This is the only place that this Greek word is found in the New Testament.</span></span> This is the time of year when trees would be expected to have fruit ready to pick.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is another way to interpret this metaphor: Late <em>autumn</em> was after the harvest was over, and the <em>trees</em> had lost their leaves. A tree like that cannot have “fruit.” Therefore, according to this interpretation, the meaning of this expression is “ <em>trees</em> that can have no “fruit” because harvest time is over.” Like “fruit trees” cannot have “fruit” after the harvest is over and their leaves have fallen off, these fake Christians cannot do anything good. Some English versions have translated according to this interpretation without mentioning late <em>autumn</em>. Instead they mention the condition of the “trees” at that time. For example:They are like leafless trees…unable to produce fruit (CEV).<em>-or-</em>they are withered…without any fruit (GW).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The meaning of 12e is almost the same as 12d. In both metaphors, Jude illustrated how useless and unhelpful these people were. They are like fruit trees that should have fruit, but have none. Some ways to say this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They are like trees that bear no fruit, even in autumn. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They are like fruit</span> trees that have no fruit <span data-bnType=\"implied\">even</span> at harvest time.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>twice dead:</strong> Jude described these people as trees that are <em>twice dead</em>. The phrase <em>twice dead</em> meant that they were completely dead. They were useless, totally incapable of producing anything good.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Two other interpretations of <em>twice dead</em> are:(1) They were spiritually <em>dead</em> because of their moral corruption, and were already marked/destined to receive the second death on Judgment Day. The phrase <em>twice dead</em> with this interpretation is similar in meaning to “they have been destroyed” in 11d.(2) They were <em>dead</em> in sin prior to conversion, then were brought to life through conversion and baptism, and now were <em>dead</em> a second time because they had become apostates.</span></span> Other ways to say this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>completely dead (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>doubly dead (JBP, NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>not only dead but doubly dead. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>after being uprooted:</strong> Jude used the metaphor of <em>uprooted</em> trees to illustrate how completely unable the fake Christian were to do good. They were as useless as <em>uprooted</em> trees that can never give fruit. They could not do anything good to please God or help his people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some scholars interpret <em>uprooted</em> here to mean that God would destroy these people, like a farmer would uproot a fruit tree that never bears fruit. However, Jude did not make this meaning explicit, and there are other reasonable interpretations. It is recommended that you do not follow the interpretation that <em>uprooted</em> means that God would destroy these fake Christians.</span></span></p>",

Compared to other stars, the planets seemed to wander across the sky, and so they were unreliable guides for navigation. If Jude’s readers understood the <em>wandering stars</em> to be the planets, they might also have seen a comparison to the Roman and Greek gods who shared names with the planets. Whole societies had been misled by believing in these false gods.</span></span> They could do this because stars moved in a way that they could predict. The Greek expression that the BSB translates as <em>wandering stars</em> refers to other lights in the sky. Some scholars believe that this refers to the planets. Compared to the stars, these lights seemed to wander across the sky. This made them useless for indicating direction.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The fake Christians misled people. Like the wandering stars, they were not reliable as guides, and people should not follow (imitate) them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If this metaphor is not clear, you may use a simile. You may also make explicit the similarity between the <em>wandering stars</em> and the fake Christians. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They are unfit guides, like</span> stars that wander <span data-bnType=\"implied\">unpredictably in the sky</span>.</p></blockquote><h4>13d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"13d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for whom blackest darkness has been reserved forever.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">A place of</span> deep darkness <span data-bnType=\"implied\">is</span> waiting/reserved for them, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">where they must stay</span> forever.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The Lord is</span> keeping <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a place</span> for them that is completely dark <span data-bnType=\"implied\">where they must stay</span> forever.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The Lord</span> intends <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to confine</span> them in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the</span> complete darkness <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of hell</span> for eternity.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In this part of the verse Jude indicated that the Lord was keeping a place of eternal darkness for the fake Christians. They would be sent there because they did not really believe in Jesus, and when they joined the church, they planned to do evil. This eternal darkness is one description of the place of eternal punishment, which other biblical writers have called “hell.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for whom blackest darkness has been reserved forever:</strong> Here Jude used irony to emphasize the punishment of the fake Christians. In 13c, he used the metaphor of “wandering stars.” The irony is that though Jude described the fake Christians as lights in the sky, they would have to stay in the <em>blackest darkness</em> forever.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for whom:</strong> The Greek pronoun that the BSB translates here as <em>for whom</em> can refer to either the fake Christians or the wandering stars. Either way, Jude was referring to the fake Christians, because the stars were a metaphor that he had used to describe them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>blackest darkness:</strong> The Bible sometimes refers to the place of eternal punishment as <em>darkness</em> (for example, Matthew 8:12, 22:13, 25:30). The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>blackest</em> is the same word that the BSB translates as <em>darkness</em> in 6c. It can also be translated as “gloom.” Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the utter depths of…darkness (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the deepest darkness (NRSV, GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>gloomy darkness (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>has been reserved:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Jude frequently used the Greek verb, <em>tēreō</em>, which the BSB has translated as “kept” or “stay.” He used a form of <em>tēreō</em> in 1f, 6a, 6c, here in 13d (where the BSB uses the verb “reserved”), and “kept” in 21a. Though it was possible for Jude to use one verb in all these places, the meanings translated into natural English require the use of more than one English verb.</span></span> If it is more natural in your language to use active verbs, you may need to say who it was who <em>reserved</em> the darkness.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NLT makes the verb active without saying who reserved the darkness. The NLT did this by referring to the darkness as the destination that the fake Christians were “heading” for, rather than as something waiting for them. It says: “They are…heading for everlasting gloom and darkness.”</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Lord has reserved a place for them….</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>forever:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates here as <em>forever</em> can be translated literally as “for eternity.” Jude meant that the fake Christians would have to stay in the darkness <em>forever</em>.</p>",

Enoch lived in the Old Testament period, before the great flood. Genesis 5:18–24 indicates that Enoch had a special relationship with God, and that he never died.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Enoch prophesied that the Lord would condemn people like these fake Christians. Jude did not learn this prophecy from the Bible, but from some other reliable source.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Jude presented the information about Enoch in an order that is unusual for some languages, including English. A general comment at the end of the notes for 15d shows a way to reorder 14–15.</p></div><h4>14a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"14a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Enoch, the seventh from Adam,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Enoch was the seventh <span data-bnType=\"implied\">generation</span> from Adam, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who was the first</span>.</p></li><li><p>¶ Enoch <span data-bnType=\"implied\">was born in</span> the seventh <span data-bnType=\"implied\">generation</span> starting with Adam, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who was born in the first generation</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Enoch, the seventh from Adam:</strong> Jude identified <em>Enoch</em> as <em>the seventh from Adam</em>. The list of his ancestors recorded in Genesis chapter 5 begins with Adam, the first person whom God created. The order in Genesis 5 is:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Adam</p></li><li><p>Seth</p></li><li><p>Enosh</p></li><li><p>Kenan</p></li><li><p>Mahalalel</p></li><li><p>Jared</p></li><li><p><u>Enoch</u></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">According to the way that Jude and his readers counted generations, <em>Enoch</em> was <em>the seventh from Adam</em>. They counted Adam as the first generation. According to the way that some other people groups normally count generations today, <em>Enoch</em> was the sixth generation <em>from Adam</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Because the number seven is an important number in the Bible,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The number seven can symbolize completeness.</span></span> it is recommended that you use <em>seventh</em> in your translation, instead of “sixth.” You may be able to say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Enoch was the seventh <span data-bnType=\"implied\">generation</span> from Adam, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who was the first</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If your language requires you to say something other than <em>seventh</em>, it is recommended that you include a footnote explaining that Jude wrote <em>seventh</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This numbering includes both the first and the last in the series of seven names from Adam to Enoch.

However, a similar statement was written in the non-biblical Jewish book of 1 Enoch.</span></span> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>prophesied</em> can also be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>foretold</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>told what would happen</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">was inspired by God to</span> foretell…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See prophesy in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>about them:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Greek pronoun <em>toutois</em> is in the dative case. In a note, the NET interprets this as a dative of disadvantage, meaning that Enoch prophesied “against them.”</span></span> The Greek expression that the BSB translates as <em>about them</em> can also be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>about these men (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>about these people (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>against them (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>them:</strong> The Greek pronoun that the BSB translates here as <em>them</em> refers to the fake Christians whom Jude mentioned in verses 4, 8, and 10–13. Some English versions use a general expression like “these <u>people</u>.” Other notes that refer to this issue are “certain men” in 4a, and “these men” in 12a and in 10a.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 14 a-b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The third word in the Greek text of Jude 14 is <em>kai</em>, which is often translated “and.” Here it probably means “also” as in 14b of the BSB and indicates that the fake Christians were also included in what Enoch prophesied. Consider a natural way in your language to express this. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>It was of these also</u> that Enoch in the seventh generation from Adam prophesied. (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to leave this <em>kai</em> untranslated.</p></div><h4>14c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"14c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Behold, the Lord is coming with myriads of His holy ones</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“Look!<sup>(plur)</sup> The Lord will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">certainly</span> come with many thousands of his holy <span data-bnType=\"implied\">angels</span>.</p></li><li><p>“Listen<sup>(plur)</sup> to this! The Lord will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">certainly</span> come with a very large number of his holy <span data-bnType=\"implied\">angels</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">The Greek text of this verse contains the verb <em>legōn</em>, which can be translated literally as “saying.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It was of these also that Enoch…prophesied, <u>saying</u>, (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">This verb introduces Enoch’s prophecy. In 14c through the end of 15, Jude quoted Enoch’s words. Introduce this quote in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Behold:</strong> The Greek word <em>idou</em> that the BSB translates as <em>Behold</em> is used here to focus the attention of the reader on what Jude was about to say. Other ways to translate this word include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Look!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Listen to this!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I tell you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Consider how to focus the readers’ attention in a natural way in your language. If your language would not use an expression like <em>idou</em> here, you may need to omit it, as some English versions have done. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Lord will come with many thousands of his holy angels… (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Lord:</strong> The phrase <em>the Lord</em> refers here to Jesus Christ. Jude referred to him as <em>Lord</em> in this verse, even though <em>Lord</em> was not in Enoch’s original prophecy.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>1 Enoch 1:9 says, “And behold! He cometh with ten thousands of His holy ones…” (R.H. Charles, <em>The Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament in English</em> (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1973, 1913), page 189.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>is coming:</strong> The form of the Greek verb that the BSB translates here as <em>is coming</em> is past tense (“came”). Enoch’s prophecy concerned future events. However, Jude quoted Enoch as if he were speaking about past events.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The past tense may indicate that the prophet had actually seen the events of the prophecy in a vision or in his mind. For example, the REB says: “I <u>saw</u> the Lord come with his myriads of angels….”</span></span> It was common for prophets to speak like this to indicate that the prophecy would certainly happen.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Another way to think about this certainty is that, by using the past tense, the prophet indicated that what he prophesied was as certain as if it had already happened.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">You may use the verb form that is most appropriate in your language to communicate a prophecy (whether past, present, future, or another form). In some languages it will be helpful to include a word like “certainly” to emphasize that the prophecy was certain to happen. For example,</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Lord will certainly come…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>myriads:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>myriads</em> is the plural form of “ten thousand.” The word is used in a general way to mean “a very large number.” It does not refer to any precise number. Ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>many thousands</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>countless</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>very many</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>of His holy ones:</strong> Most scholars think that <em>His holy ones</em> refers to his <u>angels</u>. See angel, Meaning 1, and holy, Meaning 2, in the Glossary. You may use your key term for angels here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>of his angels</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>of his holy angels</p></blockquote>",

This includes both righteous people and unrighteous people.</p><h4>15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and to convict all the ungodly</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and to condemn all the impious <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span></p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he will</span> convict all of those who did not respect him</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he will</span> declare guilty everyone who did not accept his authority</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and to convict:</strong> In this context, the Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>to convict</em> means “to declare someone to be guilty and to sentence the guilty person to be punished.” Some other ways that English versions translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to sentence (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to condemn (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to punish (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>all the ungodly:</strong> Copies of the Greek text differ about the phrase that is used here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some copies have a phrase that means <em>all the ungodly</em>. Most English versions follow these copies. (Some of these versions leave the idea <em>all</em> implicit.) For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>all the godless (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>all the ungodly (NASB) <em>(BSB, CEV, GW, JBP, KJV, NASB, NIV, NJB, NLT, REB, RSV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Some other copies have a phrase that means “every soul.” Some English versions follow these copies. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>every person (NET) <em>(NET, NRSV, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>ungodly:</strong> The Greek word <em>asebeias</em>, which the BSB translates here as <em>ungodly</em>, is the same word that was used in 4c. This Greek adjective described people who did not respect God or his authority. Because they did not respect God’s authority over them, they lived sinful lives. Ways to translate this include:<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Although the word “un<u>god</u>ly” includes the English word for God, this is not true in Greek (The Greek word is <em>asebeis</em>.) It is not necessary in other languages to include a word for “god” in the expression that is used to translate this idea. Some examples of ways to translate without using a word for god are: “impious,” “irreverent,” “immoral,” or “irreligious.”</span></span></p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>impious</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>irreverent</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>do not respect God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In English an adjective like <em>ungodly</em> implies a noun like “people.” In some languages it may be necessary to include a word to clarify what <em>ungodly</em> describes. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>ungodly <u>people</u> (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>ungodly <u>sinners</u> (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Jude used other forms of this Greek word several times in this verse, and once in 18d.</p><h4>15c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"15c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>of every ungodly act of wickedness</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>for all the immoral acts they have disrespectfully done,</p></li><li><p>for all the immoral and evil things that they have done,</p></li><li><p>because of all of their evil actions,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>of every ungodly act of wickedness:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>of every ungodly act of wickedness</em> can also be translated literally as “concerning all of the/their ungodly works.” These <em>ungodly</em> works are everything that they have done to disobey or disrespect God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Again, Jude used another form of the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>ungodly</em> in 15b. These people did not just disobey and disrespect God, but they did it in ways that showed their disrespect of him. Some ways to say this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they have done in rebellion (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>which they have committed in an ungodly manner</p></blockquote><h4>15d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"15d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and every harsh word spoken against Him by ungodly sinners.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and for all the defiant words that they have disrespectfully spoken against him.”</p></li><li><p>and because of all the insulting/hurtful words that sinful people have spoken against him.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Enoch had prophesied that the Lord would convict ungodly people also for the harsh words they spoke against him. Jude had already stated that Enoch’s prophecy applied to the fake Christians that he wrote about in this letter (14b). Jude had already mentioned that these fake Christians were guilty of disrespectful speech against the Lord Jesus (8d, 10a).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and every harsh word:</strong> The Greek term that the BSB translates here as <em>harsh word</em> refers to talk which is disrespectful, defiant, insulting, or hurtful.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>spoken against Him:</strong> This phrase refers specifically to the words they have <em>spoken against</em> the Lord. Enoch indicated that sinners would be punished for what they said against the Lord, not only for what they did (15c).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Him:</strong> The Greek pronoun that the BSB translates here as <em>Him</em> refers to the Lord. This pronoun refers back to “the Lord” in 14c.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by ungodly sinners:</strong> The Greek adjective that the BSB translates here as <em>sinners</em> can also be translated literally as “sinful.” Here Jude added <u>sinful</u> to his description of the <em>ungodly</em> people. This emphasized that they were guilty and deserved to be punished.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages the words <em>ungodly</em> and <em>sinners</em> may be too similar to translate separately. If that is true in your language, you may need to use only one term here instead of two.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>ungodly:</strong> Here Jude again used another form of the Greek word which the BSB translates as <em>ungodly</em> in 15b.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 15a–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In this verse, Jude repeated the Greek word that the BSB translates as “ungodly” several times. He also used the word “sinners.” He did this to emphasize that the fake Christians were <u>very guilty</u>, and they deserved for the Lord to punish them. Repetition is a natural way to express this emphasis in Greek.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may not be natural to repeat a word so many times in such a short verse. If this is true in your language, look for the most natural way to emphasize their guilt. You may be able to do this by using several different words to express the idea. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to convict all <u>ungodly</u> people for all the <u>immoral</u> and <u>evil</u> things that they have done, and for all the <u>harsh</u> words sinners have spoken against him.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will sentence/condemn all <u>ungodly</u> people for all of their <u>evil</u> and <u>impious</u> actions, and for everything <u>disrespectful</u> that <u>immoral</u> and <u>sinful</u> people have spoken against him.</p></blockquote><h5><strong>General Comment on 14–15</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The BSB text of 14a–b has reordered the phrases to be more natural English. In the Greek text, Jude began the verse by referring to the fake Christians as the ones whom Enoch prophesied about. The RSV follows the Greek order more closely here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>14b</sup>It was of these also that <sup>14a</sup>Enoch in the seventh generation from Adam <sup>14b</sup>prophesied, saying… (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may not be natural or possible to introduce the information in that order. It may help to reorder verses 14–15. Reordering may also help to connect these verses to verse 16. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>14a</sup> Enoch, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">born in</span> the seventh <span data-bnType=\"implied\">generation</span> from Adam, <sup>14b</sup>prophesied, <sup>14c</sup>“See, the Lord will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">certainly</span> come with many thousands of his holy <span data-bnType=\"implied\">angels</span>. <sup>15a</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">When he comes,</span> he will judge everyone, <sup>15b</sup>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he will</span> sentence all ungodly people. <sup>15c</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He will condemn them</span> for all the immoral and evil things they have done, <sup>15d</sup>and for everything disrespectful that ungodly and sinful people have spoken against him.” <sup>14b</sup>Enoch’s prophecy applies also to the people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who have infiltrated your church</span>. <sup>16a</sup>These men are…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">If you use this order, you may need to use a more specific phrase at the end of 14–15 to refer to the fake Christians. Since “These men” in 16a resumes the description of the fake Christians, it may be helpful at the end of 14–15 to use a clear phrase in your language. You can consider using the one which you used in 4c. In the example above, these people are referred to as “the people who have infiltrated your church.”</p></div>",

Enoch lived in the Old Testament period, before the great flood. Genesis 5:18–24 indicates that Enoch had a special relationship with God, and that he never died.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Enoch prophesied that the Lord would condemn people like these fake Christians. Jude did not learn this prophecy from the Bible, but from some other reliable source.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Jude presented the information about Enoch in an order that is unusual for some languages, including English. A general comment at the end of the notes for 15d shows a way to reorder 14–15.</p></div><h4>16</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In this verse, Jude applied Enoch’s prophecy (14c and 15a–d) directly to the fake Christians in the Christian church to which he was writing.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>As mentioned in the Introduction for these Notes, Jude used the “midrash” style, which was sometimes used by Jewish rabbis. This style had text-application pairs. Here Jude wrote the application part (verse 16) of this midrash (14–16). This comment applied the text part (14c–15) to the situation about which Jude was writing. In 16 he further described the ways of the fake Christians.</span></span></p><h4>16a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"16a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>These men are discontented grumblers,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>These men grumble and complain <span data-bnType=\"implied\">continually</span>,</p></li><li><p>These people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about whom I am writing to you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">always</span> complain and blame <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the Lord</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>These men:</strong> Again, <em>These men</em> refers to the fake Christians. Jude mentioned these people frequently throughout his letter (4, 8a, 10–13, 14b).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>men:</strong> The Greek pronoun that the BSB translates as “These men” did not necessarily refer only to males. Many English versions do not indicate whether they were male or female. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>These people… (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They… (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>discontented:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>discontented</em> refers to people who are critical and find fault with others. They criticize other people, the Lord,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The fake Christians may have been blaming the Lord for the things they did not like.</span></span> situations, or anything at all. This word is similar in meaning to the word that the BSB translates as “grumblers,” and the form also implies that the fake Christians did this repeatedly or as a habit. Some ways to translate this idea are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>faultfinders (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>blame others (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>criticizers</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>malcontents</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to specify with whom they found fault. If that is true in your language, you may specify that they found fault with the Lord. However, it is better to be general here, if possible.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>grumblers:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>grumblers</em> refers to people who complain. Some English versions use a verb to translate this idea. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>These people grumble. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>These people complain. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word indicates that the people grumbled as a habit. They complained repeatedly. If your language has a special way to indicate habitual or repeated action, consider using it here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Jude did not say <u>against whom</u> the fake Christians were grumbling or what they were grumbling about. However, in the context, he may be referring to the “harsh words” they “spoke against” the Lord (verse 15).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Specifically, the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></span> In a sense, all grumbling is against the Lord, because he is ruler over everything.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In this letter, whenever Jude specified the person against whom a particular sin was directed, it was always against the Lord.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In verse 4, the fake Christians rejected the <u>Lord</u>, and in verse 5, the Israelites did not trust him. Here in verse 16 Jude was commenting on verses 14–15, where Enoch’s prophecy said that the <u>Lord</u> would declare guilty people who spoke harsh words against him. Therefore, it is reasonable to think that the fake Christians whom Jude described in verse 16 were grumbling against the Lord.</span></span> In some languages it may be necessary to make “the Lord” explicit here.</p><h4>16b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"16b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>following after their own lusts;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>they use <span data-bnType=\"implied\">only</span> their own desires to decide what they will do.</p></li><li><p>and they do the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">evil</span> acts they desire to do.</p></li><li><p>Their own desires lead them <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to sin</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>following after their own lusts:</strong> This English phrase is a figure of speech. The Greek text says literally: “proceeding/going according to their desires.” It indicates that their desires were the basis for their actions. They used their own desires to decide what to do, instead of considering the Lord’s will. Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>follow their own desires (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>lusts:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>lusts</em> is neutral. It can refer to good desires as well as to evil ones, depending on the context. The text implies that these people followed their own desires instead of what the Lord desired. However, in this context, their desires were evil. Some ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They do the evil acts they desire to do.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Their own evil desires lead/entice them to sin.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>governed only by their own desires (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who go wherever their desires lead them (NET)</p></blockquote><h4>16c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"16c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>their mouths spew arrogance;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They brag <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about how great they are</span>,</p></li><li><p>They make boastful claims <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about themselves</span>,</p></li><li><p>With their mouths they boast,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>their mouths spew arrogance:</strong> The Greek text that the BSB translates as <em>their mouths spew arrogance</em> is literally “and the mouths of them speaking too-large.” The fake Christians were saying arrogant things. In the context, Jude may be referring to their arrogant claims that showed their disrespect for the Lord’s authority. Some ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>say arrogant things (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>with mouths full of boastful talk (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They brag about themselves.

As he closed the portion of his letter dealing with these people, he left no doubt that they were not true Christians. Even though these people had infiltrated the church and mixed with the true believers, they did not really love God or desire to submit to him.

They were to do this by depending more and more on the truth that Christians believe (20b), and by praying with the help of the Holy Spirit (20c).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In verses 22–23 Jude told his readers how they were to act toward three types of people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Jude instructed the Christians to:(a) show mercy to people who were uncertain about what to believe,(b) quickly rescue those who were beginning to follow the fake Christians,(c) while being very careful, show mercy to those who were already following these fake Christians.</span></span> The fake Christians were harming these people through their false teaching and the sinful things that they did.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1066001020\" data-endVerseId=\"1066001021\"><h3>Paragraph 20–21</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Jude wanted his readers to continue in fellowship with God, as they waited to experience the eternal life that Jesus had provided for them.</p></div><h4>20–21</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>building yourselves up…praying…keep:</strong> The Greek verbs that the BSB translates as <em>building…up</em> (20b) and <em>praying</em> (20c) relate to <em>keep</em> in Jude 21a. Scholars have different views about exactly how these words relate to <em>keep</em>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Scholars have different opinions concerning the relationship of the participles in verse 20 to the main verb in verse 21, which the BSB translates as “keep.” Some scholars and versions interpret these participles as imperatives, because the main verb is imperative. Others interpret them as attendant circumstance, and still others as means.</span></span> The Notes takes the view that they express the means by which Jude’s readers could <em>keep</em> themselves in God’s love. The NET says:<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NET contains the following note for verse 20.“The participles in v. 20 have been variously interpreted. Some treat them imperativally or as attendant circumstance to the imperative in v. 21 (‘maintain’): ‘build yourselves up…pray.’ But they do not follow the normal contours of either the imperatival or attendant circumstance participles, rendering this unlikely. A better option is to treat them as the means by which the readers are to maintain themselves in the love of God. This both makes eminently good sense and fits the structural patterns of instrumental participles elsewhere.”</span></span></p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>20</sup>But you, dear friends, <u>by building yourselves up</u> in your most holy faith, <u>by praying</u> in the Holy Spirit, <sup>21</sup>maintain yourselves in the love of God…. (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be necessary to reorder parts of verses 20 and 21 in order to express means. For example, it may be more natural for the verb <em>keep</em> to come before these two verbs. A general comment on 20–21 at the end of the notes for 21b–c gives examples.</p><h4>20a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"20a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But you, beloved,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ But you,<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">my</span> dear friends,</p></li><li><p>¶ But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as for</span> you,<sup>(plur)</sup> friends whom I love,</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">My</span> friends, you<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">are different from them</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But you, beloved:</strong> The Greek words that the BSB translates here as <em>But you, beloved</em> are the same words that begin 17a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">These words begin a new section. They indicate that what Jude said in verses 20–21 was especially important.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>But you:</strong> The Greek word <em>de</em> that the BSB translates here as <em>But</em> shows that this paragraph contrasts with the paragraph that precedes it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The pronoun <em>you</em> is emphatic and implies a contrast between the fake Christians and Jude’s readers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>beloved:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates here as <em>beloved</em> was a normal way for Jude to address Christian friends whom he loved. It is used in the same way in 3a and 17a. See the note on 17a. See also love, Meaning 2, in the Glossary.</p><h4>20b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"20b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>by building yourselves up in your most holy faith</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>by continually building yourselves<sup>(plur)</sup> up on the very holy truths <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that</span> you<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believe</span>,</p></li><li><p>by continuing to build your<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">lives</span> on <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the foundation of</span> the completely holy truths <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that</span> you<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">have learned and believe</span>,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">have believed</span> the completely true teaching <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that God gave us</span><sup>(incl)</sup>.

Some versions make the building metaphor more explicit, by adding “foundation.” Their <em>faith</em> was something to build upon, like a foundation. This corresponds well with the case of the noun, <em>pistei</em>, which is dative.</span></span> The word can be used in a literal way to refer to constructing a building on a foundation. In this verse it is used in a figurative way. It implies that the Christians should use their holy faith as the foundation or basis for their lives (for their thoughts and actions).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation of the figure of speech may not be clear. Other ways to express the idea are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>by building your lives on the foundation of your holy faith.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>use your most holy faith to grow. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>by depending on your most holy faith as the basis for your lives.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>building yourselves up:</strong> This was a metaphor. It was based on constructing a building. In the New Testament, this metaphor was commonly used. However, it had been used so much by Jude’s time that the saying probably had a set meaning.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>It had become a “dead metaphor.”</span></span> In that case, people may have no longer thought of constructing an actual building. In many languages it may be best to express the meaning here without the metaphor of <em>building</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>By <u>using</u> your most holy faith <u>to grow</u>…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>By <u>trusting even more</u> the most holy truths that you believe…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>building…up:</strong> The form of the Greek verb that the BSB translates here as <em>building…up</em> indicates that the action should be continuing.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The same is true for the other participles and verbs in this paragraph.</span></span> It was something that Jude wanted his readers to keep doing; it was not an action that they would do only once. Some ways to indicate this in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p><u>continue</u> to build… (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p><u>keep</u> building… (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, as in Greek, there is a verb form that indicates that an action is continuing. Look for the most natural way in your language to express this idea.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">As stated in the note on 20–21, in this context <em>building…up</em> expresses a means or way by which Jude’s readers could keep themselves in God’s love (21a).</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>yourselves:</strong> Scholars interpret <em>yourselves</em> in different ways in this context:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Jude meant that <u>each individual Christian</u> should build <u>himself or herself</u> up.</p></li><li><p>Jude meant that <u>the Christians</u> were to build <u>each other</u> up.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">If your language requires you to distinguish between these two interpretations, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>While interpretation (1) may have been Jude’s primary meaning here, he certainly would have favored building others up as well.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in your most holy faith:</strong> In some languages, it may be more natural to translate this idea without using a preposition like <em>in</em> or “on.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>by continuing to <u>use</u> your most holy faith <u>to build</u> your lives</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>by basing your life/actions/thought more and more on the true teachings that you believe</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>your…faith:</strong> Here, <em>your…faith</em> refers to the true Christian teachings that Jude’s readers had been taught. See faith, Meaning 2, in the Glossary. The Greek form that the BSB translates as <em>your</em> is plural. As Christians, this faith was something that they all believed.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>most holy faith:</strong> Jude described their faith as <em>most holy</em>, because:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>God<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.</span></span> is <em>holy</em>, and God had revealed this faith to them.</p></li><li><p>This faith was about how God saved us by providing a <em>holy</em> sacrifice for our sins, Jesus Christ.</p></li><li><p>Nothing is more <em>holy</em> than God.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Jude was not comparing their faith to other faiths here. He was expressing the unique holiness of their faith. Other ways to translate <em>most holy faith</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>most sacred faith (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the truth about God that you believe</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the unique beliefs that you received from God</p></blockquote><h4>20c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"20c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and praying in the Holy Spirit,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">and</span> by praying with the Holy Spirit helping/directing you,<sup>(plur)</sup></p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">and</span> by continuing to pray with the Holy Spirit as your<sup>(plur)</sup> guide,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and praying in the Holy Spirit:</strong> The note on 20–21 mentioned that the verb <em>praying</em> is related to the verb “keep” in 21a. Praying <em>in the Holy Spirit</em> was a means/way by which Jude’s readers were to keep themselves in God’s love (21a).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Praying <em>in the Holy Spirit</em> implies that they should be <em>praying</em> with the help and guidance of the <em>Holy Spirit</em>. Two ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>pray with the Holy Spirit helping/directing you.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>praying with the Holy Spirit as your guide.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>praying:</strong> The form of the Greek verb that the BSB translates here as <em>praying</em> indicates that the action should be continuing.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The same is true for the other participles and verbs in this paragraph.</span></span> Jude meant for his readers to continue to pray. Refer to the note on “building…up” in 20b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>by continuing to pray</u> as you are directed by the Holy Spirit.</p></blockquote>",

They were to continue to do this as they waited for the Lord, Jesus Christ, to return so that they could live forever with him.</p><h4>21a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"21a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>keep yourselves in the love of God</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>maintain yourselves<sup>(plur)</sup> in God’s love <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for you</span><sup>(plur)</sup>,</p></li><li><p>keep experiencing God’s love <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for you</span><sup>(plur)</sup>,</p></li><li><p>stay constantly aware that God loves <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span><sup>(plur)</sup>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>keep yourselves in the love of God:</strong> This clause means “continue to experience God’s love.” It indicates that Jude’s readers should always remember that God loves them. They should live in such a way that they enjoy that knowledge. They should not do anything that would hinder them from experiencing his love or from receiving his blessings. Some ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>maintain yourselves in God’s love.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>keep experiencing God’s love <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for you</span>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>always remain in God’s love <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for you</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>keep:</strong> Jude frequently used the Greek verb <em>tēreō</em>, which the BSB translates as <em>keep</em>. He used a form of <em>tēreō</em> in 1f, 6a, 6c, 13d (where the BSB translates it as “reserved”), and here in 21a. It was possible for Jude to use one verb in all these contexts in Greek because <em>tēreō</em> could be used in many different ways.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In other languages, including English, it may not be natural or possible to use the same verb in all these contexts. In each context, you should use a verb that expresses the meaning in a natural way.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the love of God:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>love of God</em> in this context probably refers to God’s love for them, rather than to their love for God.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some English versions indicate this explicitly, including CEV, GW, JBP, NCV, NIV, NJB, and NLT. English versions which are ambiguous are: BSB, KJV, NASB, NET, NRSV, REB, RSV, and GNT.</span></span> See love, Meaning 1, in the Glossary. Here is another way to translate this verse part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Live in such a way that God’s love can bless you. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>love of God</em> is then parallel in meaning to “the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ” in 21c. These two phrases together are similar in meaning to what Jude wrote in 1e and 1f:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>loved by God the Father and kept by Jesus Christ:</p></blockquote><h4>21b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"21b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>as you await</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>as you<sup>(plur)</sup> wait</p></li><li><p>as you<sup>(plur)</sup> wait/hope for</p></li><li><p>as you<sup>(plur)</sup> keep looking forward to</p></li></ul></div><h4>21c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"21c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you eternal life.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be transformed in order</span> to live forever, because of the mercy that our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord, Jesus Christ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">has shown us</span><sup>(incl)</sup>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the time/day when</span> our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord, Jesus Christ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will return</span>, so that you<sup>(plur)</sup> will live <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with him</span> forever, because he had mercy on <span data-bnType=\"implied\">us</span><sup>(incl)</sup>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the return of</span> our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord, Jesus Christ.

It may be easier to understand the meaning if the ideas are expressed in a different order. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>21c</sup>Our Lord Jesus Christ is merciful to you. Because of his mercy, he will give you eternal life. <sup>21b</sup>You are expecting/waiting-for him to do that.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Below are some ways that English versions have expressed the meaning. Notice that in each version a different idea follows the verb. These ideas are underlined.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as you wait for <u>our Lord Jesus Christ</u> in his mercy to give you eternal life. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as you wait for the <u>eternal life</u> that our Lord Jesus Christ in his mercy is going to give you. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as you look forward to <u>the day</u> when our Lord Jesus Christ in his mercy will give you eternal life.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">These are not different interpretations. Instead, they are different ways to express the same interpretation in a clear and natural way. Use a natural way to express the idea in your language.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example, in English, the objects “Jesus Christ” and “the day” are most natural when a form of the verb “wait” is used. The objects “eternal life” and “the day” work well in English with “look forward to.” However, while “the mercy” follows the form of the Greek wording, it is less natural with these verbs in English.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>as you await:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates <em>as you await</em> is related to the verb “keep” in Jude 21a. Scholars have different views about exactly how it relates to this verb:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It relates to the <u>time</u> of the verb “keep.” The action of the verb (<em>await</em>) happens <u>at the same time</u> as the action “keep.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>keep…<u>as</u> you wait (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>maintain…<u>while</u> anticipating (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Remain…<u>as</u> you look for (GW) <em>(BSB, CEV, GW, KJV, NASB, NCV, NET, NIV, NLT, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is another command, like the verb “keep.” The waiting was <u>another thing that Jude told his readers to do</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>keep…and wait for (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Keep…and look forward to (REB) <em>(JBP, NJB, NRSV, REB, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), as the majority of the English versions do.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">A general comment on 21b–c at the end of these notes for 21b–c gives suggestions for how to relate the parts of 21b–c to each other in a translation.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>await:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In the Bible, waiting and anticipation are often associated with the end times, and that is true here. Jude already referred to the end times in verses 6e and 14c–15.</span></span> In this context, the Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>await</em> means “expect” or “anticipate.” The English expression <em>await</em> is also used here with that meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ:</strong> The <em>mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ</em> is the kindness that Jesus would show toward Jude’s readers. He would show this mercy to them specifically by giving them eternal life when he returned.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>mercy:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>mercy</em> is also discussed in a note for verse 2. See mercy, Meaning 2, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>our Lord Jesus Christ:</strong> Jude used the phrase <u><em>our</em></u> <em>Lord Jesus Christ</em> to indicate the relationship that he and his readers had with their master <em>Jesus Christ</em>. This same phrase is also used in 4f and 17b. See Lord in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to bring you eternal life:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates here as <em>to bring you eternal life</em> is literally, “to/for eternal life.” The English versions have supplied a verb,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example, the BSB supplied <em>to bring</em>. Many English versions supply the verb “give.” (CEV, GW, NCV, NJB, NLT, REB, GNT). When considering whether a verb such as “give” should be supplied as implied information, you may wish to make sure that it does not imply that believers do not, in any way, have eternal life during their time on earth, because in one sense they do (John 3:36, John 5:24, and John 6:47).</span></span> because it is required in English for the translation to be natural and clear.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>eternal life:</strong> Here, <em>eternal life</em> is life that never ends. Jesus made <em>eternal life</em> possible by paying the penalty for people’s sins when he suffered and died on the cross. In one sense, Christians receive <em>eternal life</em> when they first believe in Jesus Christ as their Savior. However, in another sense, they will experience it fully only when Jesus returns. Then they will be transformed, and there will no longer be any sin or death.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here Jude was talking about this time when Jesus returns.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Here <em>eternal life</em> refers specifically to the life without end that believers experience following the resurrection of the dead that will take place when Jesus returns.</span></span> It is not recommended that you include such details in your translation.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 21b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">A translator must determine the best way to write about the connection that Jude intended to express between his readers “awaiting,” “Jesus Christ,” “mercy,” and “eternal life.” The ways that English versions have expressed this may not fit your language. Here are some examples of other ways to express the relationship between the parts of 21b–c:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as you wait <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be transformed in order</span> to live forever, because our Lord Jesus Christ had mercy <span data-bnType=\"implied\">on us</span><sup>(incl)</sup>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as you look forward to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the return</span> of our Lord Jesus Christ. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Then</span> you will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">enjoy</span> the life that does not end, because he is compassionate <span data-bnType=\"implied\">toward us</span><sup>(incl)</sup>.</p></blockquote><h5><strong>General Comment on 20–21</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In English, this paragraph sounds more natural if its parts are reordered so that the main verb (BSB: “keep”) comes before the verbs of verse 20 (BSB: “building…up” and “praying”). Here are examples of how this might be done:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>20a</sup> But you, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">my</span> dear friends, <sup>21a</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you should</span> maintain yourselves in God’s love. <sup>20b</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Do this</span> by building your lives upon <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the foundation of</span> the uniquely holy truths that you believe, <sup>20c</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and</span> by praying with the Holy Spirit <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as your guide</span>, <sup>21b</sup> as you wait <sup>21c</sup>to live forever because of the mercy our Lord Jesus Christ shows us.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>20a</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">My</span> friends, <sup>21a</sup> continue to experience God’s love <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for you</span>. <sup>20b</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Do this</span> by basing your lives more and more on the most sacred truths you have believed <sup>20c</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and</span> by praying with the guidance of the Holy Spirit. <sup>21b</sup> Keep doing this while you wait <sup>21c</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">for the day when</span> our Lord, Jesus Christ, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will return</span>. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Then</span> you will live forever, because he had mercy <span data-bnType=\"implied\">on us</span>.</p></blockquote></div>",

The phrase <em>by snatching them from the fire</em> expresses <u>the way by which</u> Jude’s readers should save these other people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>English versions that translate this way include: BSB, GW, NET, NJB, NLT, NRSV, REB, RSV, GNT. Others may also be understood this way, especially the CEV and NASB.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">See save, Word 1, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>others:</strong> The <em>others</em> here refers to the second type of people whom the fake Christians had influenced. Jude wanted his readers to help them, too. Because the fake Christians had more influence on this second group of people than on the first group in verse 22, they were in even greater spiritual danger. They seem to have believed the lies that the fake Christians had told them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>snatching them from the fire:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Amos 4:11 and Zechariah 3:2 use similar figures of speech. These two passages use the image of a stick being snatched from the fire to describe how the Lord rescued people from danger.</span></span> The Greek word that the BSB translates here as <em>snatching</em> means to pull or remove something quickly. The phrase <em>snatching…from the fire</em> refers to pulling people away from the fire. Jude’s readers were not literally <em>snatching</em> or pulling people from the fire of God’s judgment. However, they could help people to repent and escape it. The Greek text has expressed this idea in a vivid way. Use an appropriate expression in your language to communicate this meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>from the fire:</strong> Scholars have different opinions about what <em>the fire</em> represents in this verse. Two different interpretations are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The phrase <em>the fire</em> here is the eternal <em>fire</em>, also mentioned in verse 7. It refers to <u>hell</u> (or God’s <u>judgment</u> of sinners). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the fire <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of hell</span> (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the flames of judgment (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>The phrase <em>the fire</em> here is a metaphor that represents <u>some other unspecified danger</u>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example, the fire could represent their lifestyle of following the fake Christians.</span></span></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is most likely that <em>the fire</em> refers to hell or God’s judgment, as interpretation (1) indicates. However, most English versions, including the BSB, do not make that idea explicit. If you must include this information, see the examples above and the Display for suggestions.</p><h4>23b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"23b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and to still others show mercy tempered with fear,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Show<sup>(plur)</sup> mercy to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">still/yet</span> others.

Their influence on this third type was even worse than it was on the first two types (verse 22–23a). The people of this third group believed the wrong teaching of the fake Christians and committed the same sins.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>show mercy:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates here as <em>show mercy</em> is the same word that the BSB translates as “have mercy” in verse 22. (See the note on verse 22.) It means to be kind and compassionate to people by helping them. Jude wanted his readers to do this for the people mentioned in verse 22, and also for this third group of people (23b–c). See mercy, Meaning 3, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>tempered with fear:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates here as <em>tempered with fear</em> is literally <em>with fear</em>. Scholars have different opinions about who or what it was that Jude wanted his readers to <em>fear</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Jude was telling his readers to <em>fear</em> becoming involved in the same sins as these people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>23b</sup>There are still others to whom you need to show mercy, but be careful <sup>23c</sup>that you aren’t contaminated by their sins. (NLT) <em>(CEV, GW, NJB, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Jude was telling his readers to <em>fear</em> God, to revere and respect him. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>have mercy on others, coupled with a fear of God. (NET) <em>(NET)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions are ambiguous. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). It fits the context better, and it has more support in commentaries. Although Jude wanted his readers to help these people, he cautioned them to be careful, lest contact with them lead his readers to sin.</p><h4>23c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"23c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>hating even the clothing stained by the flesh.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Detest even the clothes <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they have</span> stained/soiled by their filthy/sinful deeds.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">so that you</span> are not tempted by their sins, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and become stained by committing those sins yourselves</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>hating even the clothing stained by the flesh:</strong> Jude further explained here what he meant by “with fear” in 23b by using a figure of speech. He mentioned that people <em>stained</em> their clothes as a result of sin. They could do this by an emission from their bodies. For example, someone who drank too much alcohol might soil his clothes with vomit or urine, or people might soil their clothes through sinful sexual acts.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Jude used the stained clothes as a figure of speech to emphasize that his readers must be <u>very careful</u> to avoid those sins. The people’s soiled clothing represented their sinful actions. Jude was not afraid that his readers might literally touch the soiled <em>clothing</em>. He did not want them to have <u>anything</u> to do with those sins in any way.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages this figure of speech may not express the right meaning. If that is true in your language, it may be best to use a more general expression. For example, some English versions do not mention clothes:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>…afraid that you might be <em>stained</em> by their sinful lives. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but be careful that you aren’t contaminated by their sins. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>hating:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates here as <em>hating</em> may be translated in this context as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>avoiding</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>detesting</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may not be natural to use a verb like “hate” for an object like clothes. Look for a verb in your language that fits this context.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>even:</strong> The BSB and most other English versions translate the Greek word <em>kai</em> here as <em>even</em>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BGD classifies this use of <em>kai</em> as ascensive (II.2.). The clause it introduces (“hating even the clothing stained by corrupted flesh”) intensifies what precedes it (“be merciful with fear”). Jude was highlighting the caution his readers were to exercise in their dealings with this third group of people whom they were to help. He intensified the extent to which they were to be cautious by mentioning that they were to hate/detest even the things associated with the sins of these people. The things he chose were the clothes that these people stained through their sinful actions. To highlight and intensify the degree to which they were to avoid <u>moral</u> corruption, he speaks of detesting, and hence being careful around, even things that could cause <u>physical</u> contamination or corruption.What makes this verse part particularly difficult to translate is that a translation, even with implied information made explicit, will usually sound as if Jude was really warning his readers to avoid physical contact with stained clothing. That was not Jude’s concern. Rather, by telling them to detest <u>even</u> the physical clothing, he intensified his real point, that they are to be extremely cautious lest they suffer moral contamination through becoming involved in the sins of the people they were to be helping.</span></span> Jude used it to emphasize that his readers should be very careful not to sin. They must fear sinning so much that they would <em>even</em> avoid anything that represented the sins, like the sinners’ soiled clothing.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the clothing:</strong> The word that the BSB translates here as <em>clothing</em> refers to an inner garment worn next to the skin,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NRSV calls this garment “the tunic.”</span></span> not to the long outer garment that people wore at that time. If you refer to <em>clothing</em> in your translation, here are two options:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a general expression like “clothes,” <em>clothing</em>, or “garments.”</p></li><li><p>Use a specific word that refers to a type of clothing that people wear next to their skin.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This is only a concern if your language and culture make a similar distinction between outer and inner garments. If a generic term, like <em>clothing</em>, sounds natural in this context, then you may use it.</span></span></p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Avoid words that refer to an outer garment, like a coat, that people often remove.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>stained:</strong> You may need to translate this idea differently. Use a natural expression to refer to the idea in this context.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways that English versions have translated the idea of <em>stained</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>made dirty (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>polluted (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>contaminated (NLT, REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>defiled (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the flesh:</strong> The word that the BSB translates as <em>flesh</em> refers literally to “the body.” However, Jude used the <em>flesh</em> here as a metaphor to refer to the sinful desires and actions<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A good case can be made that “the flesh” refers to the body itself that craves for things. An even better case can be made that “the flesh” refers to the sinful nature of these people that led them to sin. Ultimately, however, “the flesh” points to the sins themselves. The <u>sinful nature</u> of these people committed these <u>sins</u> in order to satisfy sinful cravings of <u>the body</u>. The three concepts are so integrally connected, that it is hard to conceive of one without the other two.</span></span> of the people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This refers to the third type/group of people that Jude wanted his readers, the Christians, to help.</span></span> See flesh in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The <em>flesh</em> was a good way for Jude to speak about the people’s sins, because they often sinned to indulge the lusts/desires of their <u>bodies</u>. Examples of these sins are:</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 22–23</strong></h5><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>eating too much food,</p></li><li><p>drinking too much alcohol,</p></li><li><p>having sex outside of marriage.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">In verses 22–23 Jude mentioned three types of people. His readers knew some people of all three types, because such people were members of their church. In some languages, it may be helpful to imply this in some way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>other people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you know</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>other people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in your church/congregation</span></p></blockquote></div>",

Despite the danger from the false teaching and sinful living of the fake Christians, Jude declared that God was able to keep them from sinning in that way, so that after they died, they would be with God. With God they would experience great joy and have no sin (24b). Jude praised God for who he is<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>He is the only God.</span></span> and for what he has done<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>He has saved us through our Lord, Jesus Christ.</span></span> (25a–b). He listed some attributes of God: glory, majesty, power, and authority. Jude ascribed these attributes to God for all times: past, present, and in the future.</p></div><h4>24–25</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Now to Him…to the only God our Savior be glory…Amen:</strong> In these verses Jude praised God using a special form called a “doxology.” The words <em>to Him</em> and <em>to the only God our Savior</em> are part of this special form of praise. In the Bible, authors often concluded a book, letter, or section of a letter with a doxology. If possible, you should be consistent in the way you translate doxologies throughout the Bible.</p><h4>24</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In this verse, Jude spoke of God as the one who could protect his readers from sin and cause them to be with him forever.</p><h4>24a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"24a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ God is able to protect/defend you<sup>(plur)</sup> so that you<sup>(plur)</sup> do not fall,</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">In conclusion,</span> God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">is the one who</span> is able to protect/defend you<sup>(plur)</sup> so that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">sin/evil</span> will not trip you.<sup>(plur)</sup></p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Glory belongs</span> to God. He is able to keep you<sup>(plur)</sup> from falling <span data-bnType=\"implied\">away from him</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Now to Him who is able:</strong> The Greek expression that the BSB translates as <em>to Him who is able</em> describes <u>God</u>. It is literally “to the being-able-(one).” It is linked closely to the phrase “to the only God” in verse 25.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span><em>Tō</em>, the masculine definite article is in the dative case, as is <em>monō</em> <em>theō</em>, “only God,” at the beginning of verse 25.</span></span> God is the <u>only one</u> who can do the things that this verse mentions. Jude’s readers could not do those things to save themselves.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to use the word for “God” here in 24a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God can guard you so that you don’t fall. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God is strong and can help you not to fall. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to keep you:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates here as <em>keep</em> is different from the verb that Jude used<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In this letter, the BSB translates this Greek verb in different ways: “kept” (1f, 6c), “stay” (6a) “keep” (21a), and “reserved” (13d).</span></span> in 1f, 6a, 6c, 13d<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See the first footnote under the note for “reserved.”</span></span>, and 21a. In this context, it means:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>guard</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>defend</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>protect</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Jude indicated that God was able to protect his readers from the bad influence of the fake Christians. In English the words “keep from” have the same meaning. Look for the most natural way in your language to make the meaning clear.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you:</strong> Although <em>you</em> refers to Jude’s readers, what Jude said in this verse is true for everyone who trusts in God and in Jesus Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>from stumbling:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>from stumbling</em> is literally “without stumbling.” In this context it is used as a figure of speech. It may refer to <em>stumbling</em> from faith into a life of sin. Specifically, it may imply <u>being deceived</u> by the sinful living and false teaching of the fake Christians. God was able to protect Jude’s readers from this type of stumbling and falling.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Many scholars understand <em>stumbling</em> to refer to not attaining salvation at the final judgment.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to make the meaning more explicit.

Then it would be as if these Christians had never sinned at all. They would appear before God <em>unblemished</em> or without fault. There would be nothing for which God would blame them. A positive way to state this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that you will be <u>innocent</u>….</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in His glorious presence:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates here as <em>His glorious presence</em> is literally “the glory of him” or “his glory.” It refers here to being in the presence of <u>God</u>, that is, <u>with</u> God. The BSB supplies the word <em>presence</em>. It is natural in English to use the word <em>presence</em> when referring to someone very great, such as God, a king, or a person of high status. Another way to say this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>with God himself in his glory</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>with him where you will see his glory</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>glorious:</strong> The Greek words that the BSB translates here as <em>glorious</em> are literally “the glory.” In this context this expression refers to the <u>excellence of God’s divine qualities</u>. Everything about God is the best. God is so splendid and great that nothing can even be compared to him. Sometimes the visible sign of his splendor is described as very bright light.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Bible indicates that bright light is part of God’s splendor. (See, for example, Exodus 24:17 and Revelation 21:23.)</span></span> See glory, Meaning 2, in the Glossary. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>before him, where his splendor shines.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with great joy:</strong> Jude also wanted his readers to know that they would be very joyful when they came to God. Because they would be “unblemished” or without fault, they would not have to be afraid that God would punish them. Their <em>joy</em> would not be diminished by sin or fear. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>extremely happy</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>full of joy (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>rejoicing (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>jubilant (REB)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 24b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to reorder the phrases in 24b.

Despite the danger from the false teaching and sinful living of the fake Christians, Jude declared that God was able to keep them from sinning in that way, so that after they died, they would be with God. With God they would experience great joy and have no sin (24b). Jude praised God for who he is<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>He is the only God.</span></span> and for what he has done<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>He has saved us through our Lord, Jesus Christ.</span></span> (25a–b). He listed some attributes of God: glory, majesty, power, and authority. Jude ascribed these attributes to God for all times: past, present, and in the future.</p></div><h4>25a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"25a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to the only God our Savior</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He is</span> the only God and the one who saved us<sup>(incl)</sup></p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He is</span> the only <span data-bnType=\"implied\">true</span> God. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">He has</span> saved us<sup>(incl)</sup></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to the only God our Savior:</strong> Here Jude affirmed that there is <em>only</em> one <em>God</em>, that he is <em>the only</em> true <em>God</em>, and that God is our Savior.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>our Savior:</strong> It was common in the Old Testament to speak about God as <em>Savior</em>. God saves (rescues) his people from many types of danger or harm.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the New Testament this word usually refers to the salvation which God provided through Jesus. This is the way that Jude used it in this verse. Through Jesus Christ, God saved people from being slaves to their sins and from eternal punishment and separation from God. Other ways to say this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>our rescuer</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>our deliverer</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Savior:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Savior</em> has the same root as the one that was translated “salvation” in 3c. This is the same Greek word that the Bible often uses to talk about Jesus. See save, Word 3, in the Glossary.</p><h4>25b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"25b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Glory, majesty, power, and rule <span data-bnType=\"implied\">were his/God’s since</span></p></li><li><p>Excellence/splendor, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">supreme</span> greatness, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">perfect/complete</span> power, and rightful rule <span data-bnType=\"implied\">belong to God</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God is</span> great and excellent. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">He has the</span> power <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to do what he wants</span>, and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he has</span> the right to rule.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority:</strong> The Greek text of Jude 25 has no verb. However, in English and some other languages, it is necessary to supply a verb. There are two ways to interpret the meaning of the Greek text here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Jude was <u>giving praise to God by stating what God is like</u>. So, <em>glory, majesty, dominion, and authority</em> are attributes of God. In English, this idea can be expressed by a verb like “belong” or “are.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>glory, majesty, power, and authority <u>belong</u> to him. (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Jude was expressing as <u>a type of prayer or desire</u> for God to receive <em>glory, majesty, dominion, and authority</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>To him be glory, greatness, power, and authority. (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is difficult to determine which interpretation English versions follow only by the verb that is used. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Jude was praising God by describing what he is like.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>glory:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>glory</em> is another form of the word that was translated as “glorious” in 24b. In both places it refers to God’s splendor and excellence. Everything about God is the best. He is so splendid and great that nothing can even be compared to him. Sometimes the <em>glory</em> of God is described as the bright light that is part of his splendor.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span><em>glory</em>, as it is used here, is not something external to God or something that he is given. Rather, it is a characteristic of God himself. Everything about him is the best. He has this <em>glory</em> as part of who and what he is.</span></span> See glory, Meaning 1, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>majesty:</strong> This refers to God’s greatness as the king. There is no greater ruler. If your language has a word or phrase that describes the splendor or greatness of an earthly king or chief, you may be able to use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>dominion:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates here as <em>dominion</em> refers to the fact that God is able to do whatever he wants. God is able to accomplish all his perfect plans. In this context, the word does not refer to physical power or strength.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>authority:</strong> The meaning of the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>authority</em> is related to the word translated “dominion.” Here, <em>authority</em> refers to God’s right to rule as the absolute sovereign. He is the rightful ruler of everyone and everything.</p><h4>25c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"25c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>through Jesus Christ our Lord</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>through our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord, Jesus Christ.</p></li><li><p>by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">means of what</span> our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord, Jesus Christ, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">has done for us</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>through Jesus Christ our Lord:</strong> Scholars have different opinions concerning how this phrase relates to the other parts of this verse. Two possibilities are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It connects with “our Savior” in 25a. <em>Jesus Christ</em> is the agent/person <em>through</em> whom God saved us. God is our Savior <em>through Jesus Christ our Lord</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>25a</sup>to the only God, our Savior <sup>25c</sup>through Jesus Christ our Lord, (RSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>It connects with the list of God’s attributes in 25b, that is, “glory, majesty, dominion, and authority.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>25a</sup>to the only God our Saviour, <sup>25b</sup>…glory and majesty, power and authority, <sup>25c</sup>through Jesus Christ our Lord, (REB)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Many English versions are ambiguous on this issue. It is impossible to determine which interpretation they follow, based only on the order of phrases. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), which fits best with the meaning of each part of the doxology.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Jesus Christ our Lord:</strong> This has the same meaning as the similar phrase “our Lord Jesus Christ.” See the notes on 17b and 21b–c. See also Lord in the Glossary.</p><h4>25d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"25d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>before all time, and now, and for all eternity. Amen.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>before time <span data-bnType=\"implied\">began</span>, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">are still his</span> now, and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will remain/be his</span> forever.

He still is like this</span> now, and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he</span> always <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will be like this</span>. Indeed!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek text of Jude 25, this verse part follows 25b. The attributes of God listed there, “glory, majesty, dominion, and authority,” belonged to God for all time. They were his “before all time,” and they belong to him “now, and for all eternity.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>before all time, and now, and for all eternity:</strong> The Greek expressions that the BSB translates as <em>before all time, and</em> <em>now</em>, <em>and for all eternity</em> refer to time. They work together to communicate one idea: The attributes in 25b always have belonged to God and always will.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the notes below, definitions are given for each of these expressions of time. However, in many languages it is not necessary to translate each expression separately to communicate the idea. Look for the most natural way in your language to communicate the meaning. Your translation does not have to follow the form of the Greek text. Examples include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>from the start of time until today and until the end of time</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>from the very beginning to the very end</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It has always been so, and it always will be so.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>always and forever</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>before all time:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates here as <em>before all time</em> is literally “before all the time/eternity.” This means <em>before</em> time even began. Some ways to say this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>before all ages</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>before time began/was</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>before God created anything</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>now:</strong> This means more than just “today.” It refers to the passing of time in this present age, including the time <em>now</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for all eternity:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates here as <em>for all eternity</em> is literally “into all the ages,” and it means “forevermore, never to end.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Amen:</strong> This word occurs over one hundred times in the New Testament, so you have probably seen it before. It may be familiar to your readers from the Bible version in your national language, or your people may use it to end prayers. If this is so, it is recommended that you use that familiar term here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, you may decide to use an expression from your own language to translate the meaning. Some ways to express the meaning in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Truly!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Indeed!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So it shall be.</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 24–25</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be necessary or more natural to identify God as “the only God” at the beginning of this paragraph. In addition, it may be clearer if you reorder other parts of this paragraph. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>25a</sup>The only God <sup>24a</sup>is the one who is able to keep you from falling, <sup>24b</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">and he is able to make you</span> innocent and joyful when he brings you to stand before him in his glory. <sup>25a</sup>He has saved us <sup>25c</sup>through our Lord, Jesus Christ. <sup>25b</sup>Glory, majesty, power, and authority <span data-bnType=\"implied\">were his</span> <sup>25d</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">since</span> before time <span data-bnType=\"implied\">began</span>, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">are still his</span> now, and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will be his</span> forever. Amen.</p></blockquote></div>",
