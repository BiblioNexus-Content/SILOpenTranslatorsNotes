Other versions such as BSB follow manuscripts which do not have this text. In your translation it may be best to follow the BSB.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the church:</strong> <em>(Multiple Senses)</em> Here this means the group of Christians in the place where Diotrephes was.

In translation he should be referred to as someone who has not previously been mentioned in this letter.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>loves to be first:</strong> <em>(Connotation)</em> This implies that even if Diotrephes thinks that he is the leader of the church, John does not recognize him as the leader. He condemns Diotrephes for actively seeking such a position.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>first:</strong> <em>(Multiple Senses)</em> This means being the leader of the church in that place. John does not use either of the biblical terms “bishop” or “elder” here, and at that time Christian leaders were not called pastors or priests. So a more neutral term for a Christian leader should be used in translation here. See GNT, JB, NEB, JBP, LB.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will not accept:</strong> <em>(Meaning)</em> The Greek word used here means that Diotrephes did not accept or obey what John had written. It implies that he did not accept John’s authority to give him instructions.
