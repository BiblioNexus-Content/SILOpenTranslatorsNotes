In the Greek text, as in the BSB, 1:1–3 is a single long sentence. You may want to translate it in shorter sentences with three main topics:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The writer was Paul.</p></li><li><p>Paul wrote to the members of the church in Corinth.</p></li><li><p>Paul prayed that God would bless them.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">See the Display on 1:1–3 for suggestions.</p></div><h4>1:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">This letter is from me,</span> Paul, chosen/appointed as an apostle of Christ Jesus,</p></li><li><p>¶ I, Paul, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">greet you</span><sup>(plur)</sup>. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> chose/appointed me to be a representative of Christ Jesus.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Paul:</strong> The apostle Paul began the letter with his name so that the readers would know who had written this letter to them. The Greek language does not need to add anything more. However, in some languages, it is necessary to include a verb such as “write.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I, Paul, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">write this letter to you</span>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This letter is written by me,</span> Paul.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may not be natural for a writer to talk about/refer to himself using the same pronoun that is used to refer to another person. It may be necessary to use the first person. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This letter is from me, Paul.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I, Paul, write this letter.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus:</strong> The phrase <em>called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus</em> indicates that God appointed Paul as an apostle of Christ Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to translate this part of the verse as a clause and use the implied subject. “God” (as in 1:1b). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God called me to be an apostle of Christ Jesus. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>called:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates literally as <em>called</em> means “summoned, chosen, or appointed.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>an apostle:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>apostle</em> is literally “a messenger.” It refers to a person whom someone sends with authority to give a message or do a task. Paul was an <em>apostle</em> whom Jesus chose and gave authority. After Jesus returned to heaven, his apostles were the leaders for those who believed in him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you have already translated the Gospels, you can probably use the same term for <em>apostle</em> as you used there. In some languages you may need to change it slightly for this context. Some ways to translate <em>apostle</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">special</span> messenger</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a representative</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ Jesus:</strong> There is a textual issue here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Most Greek manuscripts have the two words in the order <u>Christ Jesus</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>an apostle of Christ Jesus (GNT) <em>(BSB, NIV, RSV, GNT, NJB, NET, ESV, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Some Greek manuscripts have the two words in the order <u>Jesus Christ</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>an apostle of Jesus Christ (KJV) <em>(KJV, NASB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ:</strong> The Greek word for <em>Christ</em> is a translation of the Hebrew word for “Messiah.” It means “the one whom God anointed.” It refers to the special man God had promised to send to save his people. Here the word <em>Christ</em> is used as a name for Jesus. Therefore you should use the word and write it in a way that is appropriate for your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the Display the name <em>Christ</em>, as well as all other names, is spelled according to normal English spelling. You may need to write this and other names as they would be said and written in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Christo</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Kraist</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Kristi</p></blockquote><h4>1:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>by the will of God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because that is what God decided.</p></li><li><p>That is the work that God wants me to do.</p></li><li><p>That is what God appointed/willed me to do.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by the will of God:</strong> The phrase <em>by the will of God</em> indicates that God decided that Paul was to be an apostle. In many languages it is necessary to translate the noun <em>will</em> as a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because that is what God wanted (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>according to what God willed/decided</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also 2 Timothy 1:1, where the same phrase occurs.</p><h4>1:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and our brother Sosthenes,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Sosthenes, our<sup>(incl)</sup> Christian brother/friend, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">joins me in greeting you</span>.</p></li><li><p>Our<sup>(incl)</sup> fellow believer Sosthenes also sends greetings.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>our brother Sosthenes:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>brother</em> is the term commonly used in the New Testament to refer to another person who believes in Jesus. This term indicates that Sosthenes was like a brother to Paul and the other Christians.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages the phrase <em>our brother</em> is only used literally to refer to a blood relative. If that is true in your language, use a natural way to refer to a fellow Christian. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>our fellow believer</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>our friend/companion who believes in Jesus as we do</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Sosthenes:</strong> <em>Sosthenes</em> is the name of a man who was with Paul in Ephesus when he wrote this letter.</p>",

In the Greek text, as in the BSB, 1:1–3 is a single long sentence. You may want to translate it in shorter sentences with three main topics:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The writer was Paul.</p></li><li><p>Paul wrote to the members of the church in Corinth.</p></li><li><p>Paul prayed that God would bless them.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">See the Display on 1:1–3 for suggestions.</p></div><h4>1:2a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>To the church of God in Corinth,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I send this letter</span> to you<sup>(plur)</sup> who meet together to worship God in Corinth.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We</span><sup>(excl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">greet you</span>, the people in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the city of</span> Corinth who belong to God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>To the church of God in Corinth:</strong> The word <em>church</em> refers here to a group of people who believe in Jesus Christ and meet together to worship God. Here the term refers specifically to the believers in Corinth. It does not refer to a building. Therefore the phrase <em>the church of God</em> can be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the group of people in Corinth who belong to God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the people in Corinth who meet together to worship God</p></blockquote><h4>1:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to those sanctified in Christ Jesus</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God has</span> set you apart for himself by making you one with Christ Jesus.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God has</span> set you apart for himself by joining you together with Christ Jesus.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to those sanctified in Christ Jesus:</strong> This is the first of two phrases describing the believers in Corinth, the people who together formed the church. The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>sanctified</em> means “ones having been made holy.” It indicates that those people have been dedicated to or set apart for God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is passive. Some ways to translate it are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to those dedicated to him in Christ Jesus,</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active verb. The implied subject is “God.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to those whom God has set apart as his own people since you are united with Christ Jesus</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in Christ Jesus:</strong> The phrase <em>in Christ Jesus</em> indicates both when and how God causes people to belong completely to himself. That takes place when they are united to Christ Jesus. God sanctified the Corinthians <em>in Christ Jesus</em> when he made them his own people by uniting them to Christ Jesus. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in union with Christ Jesus, (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>1:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and called to be holy,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He has called you to be his people,</p></li><li><p>He has summoned/chosen you to be his holy people.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>called to be holy:</strong> This is the second phrase that describes the Corinthian believers. The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>called to be holy</em> is literally “the called saints.” Some English versions use “saints.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>called to be saints (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The members of the Corinthian church were called to be <em>holy</em> people or saints because they belonged to God. They were set apart for God as his own special people to reflect his holy character. God had <em>called</em> or chosen them for this purpose.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who God called to be his people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who God has called to be his own holy people</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is passive. Some ways to translate it are:</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:2a-c</strong></h5><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You were called to be God’s holy people… (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active verb. The implied subject is God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has called to be his holy people</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">In verse 1:2a Paul addressed the church as a whole, so he used the singular noun “church.” In 1:2b-c he addressed all the individual believers in the church, so there he used plural forms. In some languages it is not natural to make this shift. It may not be clear that this verse is still talking about the same people. You may need to make that clear by saying:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to the believers in Corinth, whom he made holy in union with Christ Jesus and whom he called to belong to him</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:2d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>along with believers everywhere who worship our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord Jesus Christ.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He has also chosen</span> believers/those from everywhere who pray to our<sup>(incl)</sup> Master Jesus Christ.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>together with all those everywhere:</strong> This phrase refers to a second group of people. Besides the Corinthian believers, there were believers in other places. There are two different interpretations of this phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is connected to the phrase “called to be holy,” and perhaps “sanctified in Christ Jesus” also. God has set apart all believers for himself. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>called to be saints together with all those who in every place… (RSV) <em>(RSV, ESV, NET, NLT, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is connected to the phrase “to the church of God in Corinth.” Paul was writing his letter to other believers, not only to the Corinthians. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and to people everywhere (GW) <em>(GNT, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) since it seems to have stronger support in the English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ:</strong> The phrase <em>call on the name of…Jesus Christ</em> indicates that these people all worshiped Jesus Christ. They called on his name in the sense that they worshiped him and trusted him to help them. This is a reference to Joel 2:32. See Romans 10:13 and Acts 2:21. Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as we and all others do who call him Lord (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>all who invoke the name of our Lord Jesus Christ (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>our Lord:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Lord</em> means “master, chief.” In the passage in Joel, <em>Lord</em> was a reference to God. However, in this context it is a title for Jesus Christ. Jesus was the master whom the Corinthian believers, Paul and Sosthenes all obeyed. Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Master</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Leader</p></blockquote><h4>1:2e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>their Lord and ours:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He is</span> their Lord and our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord also.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They worship/serve him as</span> their Lord, and so do we<sup>(incl)</sup>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>their Lord and ours:</strong> This verse part adds to the information of the previous verse part. Jesus was not only the Lord whom Paul and the Corinthian believers obeyed. He was also <em>their</em> Lord, that is, the Lord of all believers everywhere. In some languages it may be more natural to make this phrase into a separate sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He is their Lord and is also our Lord.</p></blockquote>",

May he cause you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believers</span> to live together peacefully.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Grace and peace to you:</strong> The phrase <em>Grace and peace to you</em> was a common Christian greeting. Paul included a similar greeting near the beginning of every letter he wrote. It is a prayer that can be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I pray/wish that God will give</span> you grace and peace.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">May God give</span> you grace and peace.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Grace:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Grace</em> refers to God’s love and kindness toward people. People have done nothing to deserve this love and kindness.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate it in this context are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>kindness</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>generous help</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In many languages it may be more natural to translate <em>Grace</em> with a verb or clause.

He has given them spiritual life. God is also like a father in the sense that he takes care of his children. Therefore, they should obey him and trust him. In some languages it may be more natural to translate this as a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God, who is like a father to us</p></blockquote>",

He thanked God for all he had done to help the believers in Corinth. Paul said that he was thankful that God had given them spiritual gifts, especially the ability to speak well about spiritual things and to know spiritual things.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Verses 1:4–8 are one long sentence in the Greek, with the one main verb “I thank” in 1:4. The BSB translated these verses using several shorter sentences. Each sentence tells something for which Paul thanked God. See the General Comment at the end of 1:9 for another suggestion.</p></div><h4>1:4a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:4a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I always thank my God for you</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ I always/continually thank my God for/concerning you,</p></li><li><p>¶ I often/repeatedly say thank you to my God for you,</p></li><li><p>¶ I am always thankful to our<sup>(incl)</sup> God for you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I always thank my God for you:</strong> This is a figure of speech called a hyperbole. It is an exaggeration intended to emphasize something important. Paul did not mean that he talked with God about the Corinthian believers all day long. Rather, he meant that he prayed often to God on their behalf.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Each time Paul prayed for the Corinthian believers he also thanked God for them. In some languages it may be more natural to translate this hyperbole as a negative statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I never stop thanking my God… (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>thank my God:</strong> There is a textual issue here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Many Greek manuscripts have the word “my” here.

The people have done nothing to deserve his kindness (see note on 1:3). Here Paul refers to the way God had been kind to the Corinthian believers. In some languages it may be more natural to translate <em>grace</em> as an adjective or adverb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he has been gracious/generous to you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because he is kind he has given you blessings</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he graciously helped you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in Christ Jesus:</strong> The phrase <em>in Christ Jesus</em> indicates that there is a close relationship between believers and Christ. God gave the believers grace <em>in Christ Jesus</em> because he blessed them as they were joined with Christ Jesus. Another way to translate this phrase is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>now that you belong to Christ Jesus (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to translate this phrase at the beginning of this verse part.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God blessed/enriched the Corinthians with every kind of spiritual gift, and <em>therefore</em> they did not lack any spiritual gift.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you do not lack any spiritual gift:</strong> God’s Spirit had given to the Corinthian believers all the abilities they needed to do God’s work. Each person did not have every gift, but together as a church they had every gift they needed.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The verb phrase <em>you do not lack</em> is a double negative.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you have every gift from God… (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you have every spiritual gift you need… (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>any spiritual gift:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>gift</em> here means a special ability or skill. The BSB has supplied the word <em>spiritual</em>. It is <em>spiritual</em> in the sense that it is a gift from God’s Spirit. The Spirit gives these special abilities to believers so that they can serve God.</p><h4>1:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>as you eagerly await the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>as/while you are eagerly waiting for our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord Jesus Christ to appear visibly <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to you again</span>.</p></li><li><p>during this time you wait expectantly for our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord Jesus Christ to come back <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to the earth again</span>.</p></li><li><p>as you wait eagerly to see our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord Jesus Christ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">again</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as you eagerly await the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>eagerly await</em> is literally “waiting.” It refers to eagerly expecting something to happen.

(CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to the time when the believers die, the end of their time on earth</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It refers to the time when the believers die, the end of their time on earth. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul probably referred to Jesus Christ’s return, and the judgment which will take place then. Therefore the two phrases <em>the end</em> (1:8a) and “the day of our Lord Jesus Christ” (1:8b) form a doublet. A doublet is two ways of saying the same thing. A doublet is used in order to emphasize something. See the General Comment at the end of 1:8.</p><h4>1:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that you will be without fault on the day when our Lord Jesus Christ returns.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He will keep you steadfast</span> so that when our Lord Jesus Christ returns, no one can accuse you of any wrongdoing.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that you will be blameless:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>so that you will be blameless</em> is literally <em>blameless</em>. The BSB clause can be understood as either a purpose clause or as a result clause. It may be more natural to translate <em>blameless</em> as a verb clause in your language. If that is true, it is probably better to use a result clause. For example;</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that no one can accuse you… (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">God will keep believers strong and faithful. As a result, they will be found blameless on the day that he returns.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>blameless:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>blameless</em> means “irreproachable” or “faultless.” It describes someone who cannot justly be accused of wrongdoing. When Christ returns, believers will not be found guilty of any wrong or sin. This is true because they trust in Christ alone. Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>completely innocent (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>there will be no wrong in you (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ:</strong> The word <em>day</em> here does not mean a literal day of twenty-four hours. It means the time in the future that God has chosen. Two things will happen then: the Lord Jesus Christ will return to earth, and he will judge all people. In some languages it may be necessary to make some of this implied information explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>on the day our Lord Jesus Christ comes again (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Sometimes the phrase “the Lord’s day” is used to refer to Sunday. Paul was not saying that believers will be or should be blameless only on Sundays. If you decide to translate this phrase literally, check that readers do not think it means the Sabbath or Sunday.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:8a-b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The phrases “the end” (1:8a), and “the day of our Lord Jesus Christ” (1:8b) refer to the same event. Some ways to translate this to make it clear are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He/God will keep you strong so that there will be no fault in you on the day Christ returns.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God will keep you strong to the end so that you will be blameless on <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that</span> day when he returns.</p></blockquote></div>",

Then he thanked God for helping them.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1047001004\" data-endVerseId=\"1047001009\"><h3>Paragraph 1:4–9</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph Paul told the Corinthian believers what he wanted to thank God for. He thanked God for all he had done to help the believers in Corinth. Paul said that he was thankful that God had given them spiritual gifts, especially the ability to speak well about spiritual things and to know spiritual things.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Verses 1:4–8 are one long sentence in the Greek, with the one main verb “I thank” in 1:4. The BSB translated these verses using several shorter sentences. Each sentence tells something for which Paul thanked God. See the General Comment at the end of 1:9 for another suggestion.</p></div><h4>1:9</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>God, who has called you into fellowship with His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, is faithful.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>God is trustworthy, and he has called you into union with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</p></li><li><p>You can trust God, who has invited/appointed you to be joined/united to his Son Jesus Christ our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">He always does just what he says.</span></p></li><li><p>God always does what he promises/says and he is the one who has chosen you to share in the life of his Son, our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord Jesus Christ.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God…is faithful:</strong> The clause <em>God…is faithful</em> means that God always does what he says he will do. God called us into fellowship with his Son. Thus we can trust him to give us the blessings of verses 4–8. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God will surely do this for you, for he always does just what he says (NLT96)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>called:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>called</em> is the same word found in 1:1a. It means that God chose/invited/appointed the Corinthian believers to be united with Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>fellowship with His Son:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>fellowship</em> means “to have something in common with someone.” It means that these people who have a common desire/goal will have a close relationship.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here it means that God has put us into a close relationship with his Son. Thus, we share with him in the life and honor that God has given him. Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to share in the life of his Son (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>partners with his Son (GW, CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to share everything with his Son (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His Son:</strong> The phrase <em>His Son</em> further describes “Jesus Christ our Lord.” “God’s Son” or “the Son of God” is a title that was often used to refer to a savior who would be a descendant of King David. God would send this savior to rescue his people. This person was often referred to as the “Messiah” or “Christ.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The title “the Son of God” also indicates that Jesus has the same nature and character as God. The relationship between God the Father and Jesus, his Son, is similar in some way to the relationship between human fathers and sons. God the Father does not have a physical body. He did not have a sexual relationship with Mary that resulted in her becoming pregnant and giving birth to Jesus. The Son of God existed eternally as the Son with his Father.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In areas where people do not understand the title “the Son of God” in this way, you may want to include a footnote that explains the correct meaning. Here is a suggested footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This title refers to Jesus. It indicates that Jesus has the same nature and character as God. It does not mean that God the Father had a sexual relationship with Mary that resulted in her becoming pregnant and giving birth to Jesus. Mary became pregnant with Jesus in a miraculous way by the Holy Spirit of God.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is natural to speak of a son as a “child,” without specifying male or female. If that is true in your language, you may use a more general term, such as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his Child<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A translation of the title “the Son of God” must include a familial term such as “son” or “child.” Translations such as “the man who is God,” “the divine man,” or “the God man” are not acceptable, since they do not retain familial language. Examples of acceptable translation options include “the Son who comes from God,” and “the divine/unique/eternal Son of God.”</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Other verses will usually make clear that Jesus was a male child. If you use a phrase such as “his male child,” be sure that it does not imply that God had another child who was female.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:9</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">There are two main ideas in this verse. The main idea is that God is faithful. The BSB translates one idea inside the other idea. You may wish to separate the ideas and show that one is the main idea. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God faithfully keeps his promises. He called you to be partners with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God will do this, for he is faithful to do what he says, and he has invited you into partnership with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. (NLT04)</p></blockquote><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:4–9</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">There are many ways to divide these verses into shorter sentences. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>4</sup>I always thank God for you because Christ Jesus has shown you God’s good will. <sup>5</sup>Through Christ Jesus you have become rich in every way—in speech and knowledge of every kind. <sup>6</sup>Our message about Christ has been verified among you. <sup>7</sup>Therefore, you don’t lack any gift as you wait eagerly for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed. <sup>8</sup>He will continue to give you strength until the end so that no one can accuse you of anything on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. <sup>9</sup>God faithfully keeps his promises. He called you to be partners with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p></p></blockquote></div>",

His message was that all believers are united in Christ.</p></div><h4>1:10</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to translate Paul’s request using direct rather than indirect speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10a</sup>Brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I make this appeal to you. <sup>10b</sup>Agree with one another. <sup>10c</sup>Do not divide up into <span data-bnType=\"implied\">competing</span> groups. <sup>10d</sup>Come together having the same purpose and goals.</p></blockquote><h4>1:10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I appeal to you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ My fellow believers, speaking with the authority of our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord Jesus Christ, I urge you</p></li><li><p>¶ So now, my Christian brothers and sisters, since our Lord Jesus Christ Lord sent me to speak in his name/as his apostle, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">please listen to me</span> I strongly request/urge you to do this:</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek text this paragraph is connected to the previous paragraph with a conjunction. The conjunction begins a new topic. The BSB and many other versions do not explicitly translate this conjunction. However, some versions use/have “Now.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now, dear brothers and sisters, (NLT96)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But, dear brothers, (LB) <em>(KJV, NRSV, NASB, LB)</em></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">You may have a way in your language to indicate/show that you are beginning a new topic. If that is true, you should use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I appeal to you:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>appeal</em> means “to request, encourage, or urge someone to do something.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I urge you (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>brothers:</strong> Paul addressed the Corinthian believers in a friendly way. He was talking to both men and women. See also the note on 1:1c, where the singular form “brother” appears.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Brothers and sisters</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Christian friends</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>my friends (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You should research/check which is the most natural order in your language. In some languages it is best/most natural to place this word or phrase in the middle of the sentence. However, in others it is best/most natural to put it at the beginning or end of the sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>My dear friends,…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ:</strong> Paul made his request based on the authority that Jesus had given him. He wrote to the Corinthian believers as their apostle, as Christ’s own representative.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>By the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as an apostle/representative of our Lord Jesus Christ</p></blockquote><h4>1:10b-d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In this verse Paul began with a positive statement. He said, “[I appeal] that all of you agree with one another” (1:10b).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Then he said the same thing in a negative way. He said, “so that there may be no divisions among you” (1:10c).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Finally he wrote in a positive way again. He said, “so that you may be perfectly united in mind and thought” (1:10d).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Research/Check whether this is a natural order in your language. In some languages it may be more natural to put the negative command at the end. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10b</sup>I ask all of you to live in harmony. <sup>10d</sup>Live together as one united group, with the same thoughts and purposes. <sup>10c</sup>Do not split up into competing groups.</p></blockquote><h4>1:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that all of you agree together,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to all agree with one another <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in what you say and think</span>.</p></li><li><p>All of you stop arguing with one another.</p></li><li><p>Do not disagree <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with each other</span>, but be in agreement in/about what you profess to believe,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>that</em> introduces the content of Paul’s request or appeal.

They omit this conjunction.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) which is supported by several commentaries.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>there may be no divisions among you:</strong> Some of the believers in Corinth were disagreeing and arguing with each other. They were working against each other instead of working together as one body. The believers split up into separate groups/parties, according to what they thought the teachers were teaching them about following Christ. Paul wanted them to work together and be united.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>stop dividing up into groups</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>end your divisions (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to translate the abstract noun <em>divisions</em> as a verb phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I encourage all of you</span> …not to split into opposing groups.

Paul was urging the believers to get along and to live in harmony.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and that you may be united in mind and conviction:</strong> The phrase <em>mind and conviction</em> is a doublet. This means that these two nouns mean almost the same thing. They refer to how the believers are to be united.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you have two words, you should use them as the BSB has done.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, both nouns can be translated by one noun or by one noun phrase.

The GNT places it in the middle of the verse.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>some from Chloe’s household have informed me:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>some from Chloe’s household have informed me</em> is more literally “it has been reported to me by Chloe’s people.” In Greek, this clause is passive. Translate this is a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this phrase are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it has been brought to my notice by Chloe’s people (REB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active verb.

This phrase could refer to either some of Chloe’s relatives, or to some servants or slaves who worked for Chloe. Chloe was a woman, probably a rich business woman. We do not know where she lived.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Apparently some of Chloe’s relatives or workers traveled from Corinth to Ephesus where Paul was staying.

They divided into groups according to which leader they thought was the best one to follow. Paul taught them that Christ was not divided, so neither should his church be divided. His message was that all believers are united in Christ.</p></div><h4>1:12a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>What I mean is this:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Here is what I mean:</p></li><li><p>I am talking about:</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>What I mean is this:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>What I mean is this</em> is literally “But I say this.” Here this phrase introduces a detailed explanation of the previous verse part. Paul explained what sort of quarrels he meant/was talking about. Some English versions omit this phrase (see NLT, CEV). Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am referring to this:</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am talking about</p></blockquote><h4>1:12b-e</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Individuals among you are saying, “I follow Paul,” “I follow Apollos,” “I follow Cephas,” or “I follow Christ.”:</strong> Here Paul quoted what the Corinthian believers were saying to each other. Paul did not actually hear them say this. Chloe’s relatives/workers told Paul what the believers in Corinth were saying.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>Individuals among you are saying</em> is more literally “Each of you says.” This phrase does not mean that <u>each person</u> said each of these things. Paul was giving examples of the kinds of things that many people in the group were saying. In some languages it is necessary to translate this phrase in the plural, as the BSB does. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>Some of you say</u>, “We<sup>(excl)</sup> are followers of Paul.” Some others say, “We are followers of Apollos” or “We are followers of Cephas.” Still others say, “We follow Christ.”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to use direct quotes, as Paul does here. However, it is also possible to translate this verse using indirect quotes. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Some of you claim to be my followers. Some others say that they follow Apollos. Others say that they follow Peter. Still others say they are followers of Christ.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Corinthian believers were proud of their differences. Those who said that they followed Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or Christ, all said this with a proud attitude. They thought that they were better than the others who followed someone else.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The teachers themselves were not trying to form these groups/parties. Rather, the believers separated into groups according to which leader they thought was best.</p><h4>1:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Individuals among you are saying, “I follow Paul,”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>One believer says, “I belong to Paul.”</p></li><li><p>Some of you claim/say that you are following Paul’s/my teaching,</p></li><li><p>Some believers among you are saying, “As for us<sup>(excl)</sup>, Paul is our<sup>(excl)</sup> teacher.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I follow Paul:</strong> The pronoun <em>I</em> is emphatic: “As for me, <u>I</u> follow Paul.” The Greek literally says “I am of Paul.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I belong to Paul (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I am a follower of Paul (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We<sup>(excl)</sup> are in Paul’s group.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You should translate each of the verse parts 12b-e in the same way. Use the form that you choose here for each of the verse parts.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In many languages it is acceptable for Paul to use his own name here, since he was only quoting what someone else said. However, in many other languages it is not natural for Paul to use his own name here. Readers may think that Paul was talking about someone else who was also named Paul, or that Paul did not write this letter. In these languages it is necessary to translate 1:12b as an indirect quote. Then Paul can refer to himself as “I/me.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Some of you say that you are followers of me.</p></blockquote><h4>1:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“I follow Apollos,”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Someone else says,</span> “I am follow Apollos’s teaching.”</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">but others of you claim/say that</span> you are on Apollos’s side.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">But other believers among you are saying,</span> “Apollos is our<sup>(excl)</sup> teacher.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I follow Apollos:</strong> The story about Apollos and his visit to Corinth is in Acts 18:24–28.

Aramaic was the language spoken in the Judean and Syrian provinces. “Peter” and <em>Cephas</em> both mean “a stone.” The first time Peter met Jesus, Jesus gave him that name (John 1:42). Some English versions use the name “Peter” here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I follow Peter (NCV) <em>(CEV, NCV, NLT, GNT)</em></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You may wish to use the name “Peter” in order to make it more clear who Paul referred to. If you choose to use the name <em>Cephas</em>, explain in a footnote that <em>Cephas</em> was another name for Peter.</p><h4>1:12e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>or “I follow Christ.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">And yet another believer says,</span> “It is Christ’s teaching that I obey.”</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">And still others of you claim/say that</span> you are the ones who follow Christ.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">And still other believers among you say,</span> “Christ is our<sup>(excl)</sup> teacher.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I follow Christ:</strong> You should use the same form here as you used in verse parts 12b-d.</p>",

His message was that all believers are united in Christ.</p></div><h4>1:13</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse has three rhetorical questions. They function as a rebuke. Paul rebuked the Corinthian believers for thinking it was good to separate into groups. He reminded them of three things that they knew were not true. There are two ways to translate these rebukes:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>As rhetorical questions, possibly with the answer supplied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Has Christ been divided into factions? Was I, Paul, crucified for you? Were any of you baptized in the name of Paul? Of course not! (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As strong statements. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ cannot be divided! Remember, it was not I who was crucified for you. You were not baptized in the name of Paul!</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">Translate this rebuke in the way that is most natural in your language.</p><h4>1:13a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Is Christ divided?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Can you divide Christ?</p></li><li><p>It is impossible to divide Christ.</p></li><li><p>Christ cannot be divided up like that!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Is Christ divided?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. It functions as a rebuke. There are three ways to translate this rhetorical question:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Has Christ been divided? (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Can Christ be divided into pieces? (NLT96) <em>(BSB, NJB, NIV, NET, KJV, NASB, RSV, ESV, GW, NLT, CEV, JBP)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a rhetorical question with its own response. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Has Christ been divided? Of course not!</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ has been divided into groups! (GNT) <em>(GNT, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this rebuke:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>How dare you divide Christ up into factions!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this rebuke in the most natural way in your language.</p><h4>1:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Was Paul crucified for you?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Was it <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span> Paul who died on the cross for you?</p></li><li><p>It was not I who died on a cross to save you.</p></li><li><p>Did they/soldiers nail <span data-bnType=\"implied\">me</span>, Paul, to a wooden cross for you? Of course not!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Was Paul crucified for you?:</strong> Again, the obvious implied answer is: “Of course not.” The Corinthian believers knew that Christ is the one who died to rescue them from sin/wrongdoing. They were supposed to live like Christ taught them to. He was their Savior, not Paul. Since Paul was talking about himself, in some languages it is natural to use a first-person pronoun. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do you think that I was crucified for you?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Was Paul crucified:</strong> The verb <em>crucified</em> means “to be executed by being nailed onto a wooden cross.” It is a passive clause. In some languages, it may be more natural to translate this clause without using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Was it Paul who died on the cross for you? (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Did soldiers nail Paul on a cross to die?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for you:</strong> The phrase <em>for you</em> here means “for your sake,” “for your benefit,” or “to help/save you.”</p><h4>1:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Were you baptized into the name of Paul?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>When you were baptized, did they use my name, Paul?</p></li><li><p>Or, did people baptize you using my name so that you became my disciples? Certainly not!</p></li><li><p>Also consider this: you were not baptized in my name <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to become my followers</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek Paul begins this third rhetorical question with a conjunction. It can be translated as “or.” In this context, it probably signals the last in the series of rhetorical questions. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Or were you baptized… (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>(NRSV, RSV, NET, KJV, ESV, NASB, NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Several of the English versions do not translate this conjunction. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Were any of you baptized… (NLT) <em>(BSB, CEV, REB, NIV, GNT, NLT, GW, NCV)</em></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Begin this last rhetorical question in a way that is natural for your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Were you baptized into the name of Paul?:</strong> Again, the implied answer is “no.” Paul was still talking about himself here. Thus, it may again be more natural or necessary to use a first-person pronoun in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Were you baptized in my name? (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">As in 1:13a and 1:13b, the purpose of this rhetorical question is to rebuke the Corinthian believers. The Corinthian believers were baptized in Christ’s name. They followed Christ’s teachings, so they should not have been saying that they were Paul’s followers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Were you baptized:</strong> The verb “baptize” means to purify people with water during a special ritual. This ritual purified people from sin. It did not mean that the person was cleaned to remove dirt. Baptism was an initiation that marked the beginning of a person’s life as one of God’s pure people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the verb <em>baptized</em> are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a descriptive term. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">ritually</span> washed</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>initiated in/with water</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a term for a similar ritual that is already used in your culture. You may need to indicate that in this context it has a special connection with God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>purified with <u>God’s</u> ceremonial bath</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>washed in initiation water <u>for God</u></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a term that is already accepted by the local churches. In some areas this term may have been borrowed from the national language or transliterated from Greek or English.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">You may need to use footnotes or a glossary to explain the meaning more fully.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The verb <em>Were…baptized</em> is passive. Some ways to translate this verb are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>were you initiated/purified</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Did you receive baptism</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Did someone baptize/wash you in the name of Paul?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Did I baptize you in the name of Paul?</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>into the name of Paul:</strong> In the Greek culture of Paul’s time, baptism meant ownership. Being baptized into someone’s name meant that the one whose name was used owned the one being baptized. When people baptized a person using Christ’s name, the person gave/submitted himself to Christ. He then belonged to Christ. He became follower of Christ. Paul did not want anyone to think that some baptized believers belonged to him rather than to Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as followers of Paul</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as Paul’s disciples? (GNT)</p></blockquote>",

He was not saying, however, that Christ had commanded him not to baptize people. It was just not his main responsibility.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>send me:</strong> The focus of this clause is not on where Christ sent Paul but on what Christ send Paul to do. The Greek text does not say where Christ sent Paul.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to specify where God sent Paul. In some languages it may be possible to be general, using “out/around.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Christ did not send me out…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In other languages it may be necessary to be more specific. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>send me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to Corinth/you</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>send me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to faraway towns</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>send me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to foreign places</span></p></blockquote><h4>1:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but to preach the gospel,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Rather, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he sent me</span> to preach the good news.</p></li><li><p>Instead, my main work as Christ’s apostle is to tell people God’s/the gospel message about Christ.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but:</strong> There is contrast here. The contrast is between what Christ did not send Paul to do and what Christ did send him to do. Some English versions do not use a conjunction here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ did not send me to baptize. He sent me to tell the Good News (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to preach the gospel:</strong> The phrase <em>preach the gospel</em> indicates that Christ sent Paul out to do something special for him. He sent Paul out to preach the good news about salvation to people.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:17</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In 1:17a-b Paul makes a negative statement first, and then a positive statement:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Negative</u>: <em>For Christ did not send me to baptize</em>,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Positive</u>: <em>but Christ did send me to preach the Gospel</em>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">However, in other languages it may be more natural to structure this verse differently. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>17a</sup>For Christ sent me, not to baptize people, <sup>17b</sup>but to preach the gospel.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In other languages it may be more natural to reorder the clauses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>17b</sup>Christ sent me to preach the gospel. <sup>17a</sup>He did not send me to baptize people.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">If you reorder the clauses, you need to be careful about how you translate 1:17c so that the verse will be natural in your language.</p></div><h4>1:17c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:17c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>not with words of wisdom,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I do not preach the Gospel using eloquent words of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">human</span> wisdom,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I do not use</span> the clever/persuasive speech of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">human</span> wisdom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to preach the Gospel</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not with words of wisdom:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>with words of wisdom</em> is literally “in wisdom of speech/word.” There are two ways to interpret the phrase <em>with words of wisdom</em> here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “wisdom which is expressed through speech.” This refers to the rhetoric and intellectual arguments of Greek philosophy.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Fee, p. 64, and Hodge pp. 17–18.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>eloquent wisdom (RSV) <em>(RSV, NIV, GNT, NCV, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “wise speech”; that is, rhetorical skill, a clever way of talking.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Garland p. 56; Thiselton p. 143–45.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>clever speech (NET) <em>(NASB, REB, NET, NLT, CEV, JBP)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages there may not be much difference between these two interpretations. In some English versions it is difficult to be sure which interpretation is being followed (KJV, GW).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is necessary to choose between the two interpretations. If that is true in your language, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). It has slightly more support from commentaries and English versions. However, you may also use the interpretation that is followed by your own major language version.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>wisdom:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>wisdom</em> is a key/important word in this section of 1 Corinthians (1:17–31). Here it refers to the philosophical arguments that the Greek people greatly admired.</p><h4>1:17d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:17d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the death of</span> Christ on the cross would not lose its power/impact.</p></li><li><p>I do not want to rob <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the message about</span> the cross of Christ of its power <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to save people/you</span>.</p></li><li><p>I do not want to cause <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the message of</span> Christ’s death on the cross to be ineffective/powerless/useless <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to those listening</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power:</strong> The Greek clause is literally “in order that the cross of Christ should not be emptied of its power.” The English word <em>lest</em> introduces a result that Paul wanted to avoid.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If Paul preached the gospel with words of human wisdom, the power/impact of the death of Christ on the cross would be less. Paul did not want people to believe the gospel message only because of words of human wisdom. He wanted to present the gospel fully and effectively. People should decide to follow Christ because of Christ’s death on the cross for them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the cross of Christ:</strong> The phrase <em>the cross of Christ</em> literally refers to the wooden cross on which Christ died. However, in this context it is a figure of speech referring to Christ’s death for us. Another way to translate this phrase is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Christ’s death on the cross… (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>be emptied of its power:</strong> The phrase <em>be emptied of its power</em> here means “have its power taken away,” or “be made useless/powerless.” Another way to translate this phrase is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>is not robbed of its power (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a passive phrase. In some languages it may be more natural to translate it using an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>does not lose its power</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>does not become powerless</p></blockquote>",

In 1:17 he said that Christ sent him to preach the gospel, the message about the “cross of Christ.” He also said that he did not preach “with words of human wisdom.” Beginning in 1:18, Paul explained why the message about the cross is so important, and why human wisdom is not important.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Several English versions do not translate this conjunction.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing:</strong> In this verse part Paul talked about how unbelievers think about the gospel message.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a foolish message</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a nonsensical message</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, in your language it may not be natural to say that a <u>message</u> is “foolish.” It may be more natural to say that the <u>people</u> who tell this message are foolish.

This quote from Isaiah 29:14 confirms what Paul had just said about those who are perishing. What Paul means is: What I have said in 1:18 is true, because the Scriptures say the same thing.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Paul quotes Isaiah 29:14 because that verse is a good example of the truth that people cannot save themselves by their clever ideas. The prophet Isaiah lived long ago, at a time when the nation of Israel was in danger and suffered from enemies who came into their country and attacked them. Instead of turning from their bad ways and trusting God to help them, they listened to their humanly wise men telling them to go and get help from the people Egypt. Because of that, God used their enemies to punish them for their bad ways. In that way, God “destroyed the wisdom of the wise”; that is, he caused the wise men’s advice to come to nothing. From this passage in the OT, Paul reminds the believers that they should not trust humanly wise thoughts and plans about how to become good in God’s sight and how to live in ways pleasing to him.</span></span> Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For it says in the Scriptures</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For God’s book says</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The quote that follows is spoken by God. So another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>As God says in the Scriptures (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>1:19b-c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In this quote from the OT there are two short sentences joined with the word “and.” The second sentence says the same thing as the first sentence using/in different words. This is a common form of Hebrew poetry. Notice how similar these two sentences are. For example:</p><table style=\"min-width: 50px\"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p><u>1:19b</u></p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p><u>1:19c</u></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>“I will cause</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>I will make</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>the wise men</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>the wise men</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>to lose their</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>unable to</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>wisdom;</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>understand.”</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p></p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>(NCV)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p data-indent=\"1\">You may translate each of these sentences separately as the BSB and most other English versions do. However, if the repetition does not sound natural in your language, you can combine these two sentences into one. See the General Comment at the end of the Notes for 1:19c.</p><h4>1:19b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:19b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“I will ruin/destroy the wise thoughts of wise people.</p></li><li><p>“I will show how worthless/foolish are the clever thoughts of clever people.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will destroy the wisdom of the wise:</strong> This clause means that God will cause the plans of people who trust in human wisdom to fail.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is not natural to talk about destroying <em>wisdom</em>.

It means ruining something completely, making it worthless and useless.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>I:</strong> The pronoun, <em>I</em>, here refers to God. God is the one who says these words. You may need to make the subject explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>God says, “I will destroy…”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the wisdom of the wise:</strong> The phrase <em>the wisdom of the wise</em> here means something like “the clever thoughts of people who think themselves clever/wise.” In some languages, it may be more natural to translate this abstract noun <em>wisdom</em> as a noun phrase. You may use “wise thoughts” or “clever plans.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the clever plans that clever people make</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the wise thoughts of wise people</p></blockquote><h4>1:19c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:19c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I will ruin the intelligent/clever plans of smart people.”</p></li><li><p>I will show/prove that the clever ideas of clever people are not successful.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate:</strong> This clause means approximately the same thing as 1:19b.

They should be united by true wisdom, the message of the cross.</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this section Paul wrote about a serious problem in the Corinthian church. The Corinthian believers were dividing up into competing groups. They were following whichever human leader they admired the most. Paul tried to solve this problem by reminding the Corinthians of the message of the cross. He wanted them to stop following human wisdom and to follow God’s wisdom.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1047001020\" data-endVerseId=\"1047001025\"><h3>Paragraph 1:20–25</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph Paul talked more about foolishness and wisdom. The gospel message expresses God’s power and wisdom. For different reasons, both Jewish people and Greek people may reject it. However, to those who believe the message/gospel, it brings salvation from sin and death.</p></div><h4>1:20a-c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul began this verse with three rhetorical questions. Each of these questions asks where some of the clever people of this world are. Paul used these rhetorical questions to emphasize that these clever people have failed. They are not able to know God through their cleverness.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some ways to translate this emphasis are:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use rhetorical questions. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Where is the wise person? Where is the educated person? Where is the skilled talker of this world? (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use emphatic statements. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The wise man has failed. The educated person has failed. The skilled talker has failed.</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>1:20a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:20a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Where is the wise man?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ What is the position/status of wise people?</p></li><li><p>¶ So, wise people have no special advantage <span data-bnType=\"implied\">before God</span>.</p></li><li><p>¶ The wise people have no special significance/importance <span data-bnType=\"implied\">according to God’s thoughts</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Where is the wise man?:</strong> This is the first of the three rhetorical questions beginning with the word <em>Where</em>. Paul was not asking where these people were living. Paul used this rhetorical question to emphasize that people who the world thinks are wise have failed. They are not wise according to God’s thoughts or plans. God has defeated them and their clever thoughts.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul also did not mean that being wise is of <u>no value at all</u>. He meant that worldly wisdom does not help a person to know God and his eternal plan.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this emphasis are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. You may want to indicate the implied answer. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What happened to those wise people? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">They failed!</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The wise man has failed completely.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The wise man is foolish.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the wise man:</strong> The phrase <em>the wise man</em> refers to a person whom the people of this world admire as being wise. Paul did not talk about one wise man, but about all such people. In some languages it may be more natural to use a plural form. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people who are wise</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those wise people (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>1:20b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:20b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Where is the scribe?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>What is the position/status of expert people?</p></li><li><p>Scholars have no special advantage <span data-bnType=\"implied\">before God</span>.</p></li><li><p>The scholars have no special significance/importance/have failed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">according to God’s thoughts</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Where is the scribe?:</strong> This is the second of the three rhetorical questions beginning with the word <em>Where</em>. This functions as an emphatic statement that people who the world thinks of as educated people are foolish.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this emphatic statement are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Where is the educated person?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What happened to the educated person?</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The educated person has failed.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the scribe:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the word <em>scribe</em> here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to an educated professional person of any culture.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Thiselton p. 164.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the educated person (NCV) <em>(NCV, NIV, REB, GNT, GW, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to a teacher of the Jewish laws. See <em>scribe</em> in the Gospels (e.g., Mark 1:22) and in KBT. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the expert in the Mosaic law (NET) <em>(BSB, NET, RSV, KJV, NASB, ESV, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) since it has slightly stronger support in the commentaries.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul was not writing to Jewish people here. He was likely writing in general terms about any educated professional person. Professional people, at that time, were all men. Another English example is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>man of learning (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to translate this using a plural word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the scholars (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the experts</p></blockquote><h4>1:20c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:20c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Where is the philosopher of this age?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>What is the position/status of the skillful debaters of this world <span data-bnType=\"implied\">before God</span>?</p></li><li><p>The clever/skillful debaters/philosophers of this world have no special advantage <span data-bnType=\"implied\">before God</span>.</p></li><li><p>The clever/skillful debaters/speakers of this world have no special significance/importance/have failed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">according to God’s thoughts</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Where is the philosopher of this age?:</strong> This is a third rhetorical question. Paul used this rhetorical question to emphasis that skilled speakers are foolish compared to God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this emphasis are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Where are the skillful debaters of this world? (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The skilled talkers of this world are foolish.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the philosopher:</strong> The Greek word which the BSB translates <em>philosopher</em> refers to a person who has learned to debate, talk and argue cleverly. He is clever especially about philosophical thoughts. Another English example is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the debater</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul was talking about debaters in general. In some languages it may be more natural to use a plural word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The skillful debaters (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>of this age:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>this age</em> refers to the time we live in before Christ returns. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>of our time (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>this present age (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>this world order</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:20a-c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other ways to translate these rhetorical questions are:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>You can combine these three “Where” questions into one sentence.

Paul used this rhetorical question for emphasis. It can be understood as an answer to the three questions in 1:20a-c. Paul was saying that God himself has made foolish the wisdom of the world.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">God does not make use of people’s wise thinking in his plan to save people. His thoughts/plans cause wise thinking to come to nothing. Some ways to translate this emphasis are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Hasn’t God turned the wisdom of the world into nonsense? (GW)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God has shown that this world’s wisdom is foolishness! (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the wisdom of the world:</strong> Paul here referred to the wisdom of the three groups of people that he had just mentioned. They are: the wise men, the scholars, and the debaters. It may be more natural to make the connection clear by referring to “<u>those</u> wise people.” You can also be general at this point and use “all.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God has made them all look foolish and has shown their wisdom to be useless nonsense. (NLT96)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the world:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>world</em> here refers to the moral system of the world. The world’s moral system is opposed to God and Christ.</p>",

In 1:20 Paul said that God has shown that wise people’s ideas are of no value in knowing God. In 1:21–25, Paul explained that God proved that the wisdom of people who do not know God/him is really only foolishness.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>since:</strong> The conjunction <em>since</em> introduces a contrast between the methods God could have chosen to save people. God chose the method “wise” people did not expect. God did not choose to save people by letting them know him through their own wisdom (1:21a), instead he chose to save them through the foolish gospel message (1:21b).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>For God in his wisdom made it impossible for people to know him by means of their own wisdom. <u>Instead</u>, by means of the so-called “foolish” message we preach, God decided to save those who believe. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the wisdom of God:</strong> The phrase <em>in the wisdom of God</em> means “it was God’s wise plan.” In some languages it may be more natural to translate this as a verb phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>since God wisely decided</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as God in his wisdom ordained (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the world through its wisdom did not know Him:</strong> This clause indicates human failure.

This phrase also implies that God actually did what he had decided to do.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>through the foolishness of what was preached:</strong> This is a figure of speech called irony. Paul meant the opposite of the literal meaning of these words. He was not saying that the message he and the other apostles preached was really <em>foolishness</em>. He meant that people who were not saved by the message thought it was foolish.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the foolishness of what was preached:</strong> This phrase also does not mean that people thought that the <u>way</u> or <u>manner</u> in which Paul preached was foolish. Rather, people thought that the <u>content</u>, the <u>message itself</u>, was foolish.</p><p data-indent=\"3\">Translate this in a way that makes the meaning clear in your language.

He meant that many of the Jewish people he had preached to wanted proof that the message was true.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>Jews</em> refers to the ethnic group that is descended from the Old Testament figure Jacob, also named Israel. Today Jewish people may be of any nationality (Israeli, Russian, American, etc.). Therefore you should not translate this in a way that would imply it referred only to the citizens/inhabitants of the present day country of Israel.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>signs:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>signs</em> is a word that is often used in the four Gospels and Acts. This word refers to miracles, that is, acts of God’s power. (See Matthew 12:38–39; 16:1–4.) This is the main word used in the Gospel of John for miracles.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Jewish people believed that someone who could do miracles was sent by God. Therefore, they would believe what Paul/the apostles told them about Christ if they could do miracles to prove it.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Again and again the Jewish people told Jesus they would not believe what he said unless he would show them a miracle. See Matthew 12:38–39; Luke 11:16; John 4:48; John 7:3. Here in 1 Corinthians 1:22, Paul says that they demanded the same thing of the apostles, Jesus Christ’s representatives. They wanted to judge God’s message for themselves, rather than let God’s message judge them for their sins. Jesus did many miracles, but they were not the kind the Jewish people wanted to see and therefore they did not accept them as proof that he was the one God had sent to help them.</span></span></p><h4>1:22b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:22b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and Greeks search for wisdom,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And Greek people want wise thoughts.</p></li><li><p>Greek people want to hear what they think is a wise message.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Greeks search for wisdom:</strong> The clause <em>Greeks search for wisdom</em> here means that Greek people were only willing to believe things that were explained wisely. They did not want to believe things that were not presented to them in the language of Greek philosophy. Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Greeks want wisdom (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it is foolish to the Greeks, who seek human wisdom (NLT04)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Greeks:</strong> Here this word refers to people who spoke the Greek language. They also followed the Greek culture, as opposed to the Jewish culture. Paul was probably thinking of the Greeks as representatives of the Gentiles in general.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The word “Greeks” is a translation of the Greek word “Helenes.” The word “Gentiles” is a translation of the Greek word “ethnos.” It is possible that Paul uses the word “Greeks” in 1:22 and 1:24 instead of “Gentiles” because Greeks were the people who loved philosophy and wisdom the most. Also, the city of Corinth was in the province of Achaia (Greece), and so most of the Corinthians believers may have been Greeks.Most English versions follow the Greek by using the word “Greeks” in 1:22 and 1:24, and “Gentiles” in 1:23. The KJV uses the word “Greeks” in all three verses, because it follows a different Greek text.</span></span> Again, Paul did not mean that all Greeks followed human wisdom, but that <u>most</u> of them did.</p>",

The contrast is between what the Jewish people and the Greek people wanted (1:22) and what Paul and the other Christian teachers preached (1:23a). The Jewish people wanted to see miracles as proof that Paul and the others said was true. The Greeks wanted to hear/listen to wise words. Instead, Paul just preached the simple message that Christ was crucified for their sins.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we preach Christ crucified:</strong> The verb <em>crucified</em> means that people nailed Christ to a wooden cross and left him there to die.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we:</strong> The pronoun <em>we</em> here refers to the apostles and other preachers of the gospel. It is in an emphatic position. Its position emphasizes the contrast between what the Jewish people and Greek people wanted, and what the apostles preached.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If there is a way for you translate this emphasis in your language, you should use it here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>As for us, we</u> proclaim the crucified Christ (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ crucified:</strong> This is a passive clause. Some ways to translate it are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ was crucified (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ was nailed to a cross (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active verb.

It means something that makes people angry. This phrase is a metaphor. A <em>stumbling block</em> is something in a person’s path that causes him to fall down.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The message that Paul preached was like a <em>stumbling block</em> to the Jewish people. That was because they refused to believe that God would allow the Christ (Messiah) to be crucified. This was not what they expected would happen to their Messiah. So they refused to believe the gospel, and thus they were lost.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this phrase that do not use this metaphor are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This offends Jewish people… (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a message that is offensive to the Jews… (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This is a big problem to the Jews, (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to Jews:</strong> In the Greek, these words <em>to Jews</em> are placed at the beginning of the clause. By doing this, Paul emphasized the different responses of the three different groups to the message that Christ was crucified for them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If there is a way for you translate this emphasis in your language, you should use it here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>To Jewish people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the message that Christ was crucified is</span> a stumbling block.</p></blockquote><h4>1:23c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:23c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and foolishness to Gentiles,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and Gentiles think that it is nonsense.</p></li><li><p>And non-Jews <span data-bnType=\"implied\">think that our</span><sup>(excl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">message about Christ</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">is the talk of</span> foolish people.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>foolishness to Gentiles:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>foolishness to Gentiles</em> is literally “to Gentiles foolishness.” There is some implied information here. The complete sentence would be: “<span data-bnType=\"implied\">the message that we preach about Christ being crucified sounds/seems like</span> foolishness to the Gentiles.” Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>nonsense to the Gentiles (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>makes no sense to people who are not Jewish (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>most Gentiles think it is foolish (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Gentiles:</strong> The word <em>Gentiles</em> means “people who are not Jewish.” Here it means approximately the same as “Greeks” in 1:22b. The Gentiles could not understand how Christ’s shameful death as a common criminal could help anyone at all.</p>",

The complete sentence would be: “Christ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">is</span> the power and wisdom of God.” Christ is <em>the power of God</em> and <em>the wisdom of God</em> in the sense that he reveals God’s power and wisdom. Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">reveals</span> the power of God and the wisdom of God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>this message is Christ, who is the power of God and the wisdom of God (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul indicated that in/through Christ God demonstrated/showed his power and wisdom. In some languages it is more natural to translate the abstract nouns <em>power</em> and <em>wisdom</em> as adjectives. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Christ shows/demonstrates how powerful and how wise God is</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Christ has shown that God is both powerful and wise</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the power of God and the wisdom of God:</strong> Paul used the words <em>of God</em> twice here to add emphasis: “the power <u>of God</u> and the wisdom <u>of God</u>.” Both the power and the wisdom are from God. Paul showed how different people respond to the gospel message very differently.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">A Jew or Greek, whom God has not called, thinks only human thoughts. Thus, they reject the gospel message when they hear it. But when people whom God has called hear it, they think like <em>God</em> does. They understand and believe God’s message.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the power of God:</strong> Paul used the same phrase, <em>the power of God</em>, in 1:18b. Here Paul indicated that Jesus Christ reveals God’s power. God worked powerfully through Christ’s death and resurrection to save men and women. When Christ died on the cross, he appeared weak, but he was actually demonstrating God’s power. Through Christ’s death on the cross, God saves people powerfully.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the wisdom of God:</strong> The phrase <em>the wisdom of God</em> here indicates that Christ reveals God’s wisdom. God’s way/plan of saving people through the death of Christ appears foolish, but it is actually wise. Christ was crucified to take/pay the punishment for our sins.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to translate 1:24 is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But God has called some people, both Jewish people and Gentiles, to be his own. When these people hear our message, they hear a message about Christ who reveals God’s power and wisdom.</p></blockquote>",

Christ is the power and wisdom of God (1:24b-c) since the foolishness of God is wiser than the wisdom of men and the weakness of God is stronger than the strength of men (1:25a-b). The message of the cross that appears foolish and weak to unbelievers is actually wise and strong.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the foolishness of God is wiser than man’s wisdom:</strong> The phrase <em>the foolishness of God</em> here refers to what God did when he sent Jesus to die on the cross. Paul did not really mean that God did something foolish when he sent Christ to die on a cross. Paul was speaking ironically. Even though unbelievers think that the message about Christ is foolish, God is much wiser than all people. Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>what seems to be God’s foolishness is wiser than human wisdom (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>even when God appears to be acting foolishly, he is still more wise than any man</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the foolishness of God:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the foolishness of God</em> is more literally “the foolish thing of God.” It refers to the thing that God did that people think is foolish. God sent his Son to die on the cross. This was something that people considered foolish.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>is wiser than man’s wisdom:</strong> This phrase in the Greek is more literally “is wiser than people/men.” The BSB has added the word <em>wisdom</em> for stylistic reasons. In some languages it may be more natural to omit it. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>is wiser than men (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>is wiser than people are</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>is wiser than any human being</p></blockquote><h4>1:25b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:25b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and the weakness of God is stronger than man’s strength.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and when God appears to be weak, he is still more powerful than any human being.</p></li><li><p>Although unbelievers think that God was weak <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when he allowed Christ to die</span>, he wasn’t.

The conjunction introduces one basis for Paul’s statement in 1:25. The foolishness of God is wiser than man’s wisdom and the weakness of God is stranger than man’s strength. One basis for Paul saying that is that God was foolish in calling the foolish Corinthian believers to become believers (1:26–31). According to human wisdom God should have called wise and important people to become believers. Some English versions do not translate this conjunction.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul also used this conjunction to introduce a new part/step/point of his argument. In the BSB this change is shown by beginning a new paragraph. You should begin this part of the argument in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Brothers:</strong> Paul often used a term of address (like <em>Brothers</em>) when he began a new topic. Here he introduced the topic of boasting only about God and never boasting about ourselves.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the BSB, the word <em>Brothers</em> is first in the sentence. You should put/place it where it sounds natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If a literal translation suggests that Paul was only addressing males, you may need to be more explicit or general. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Brothers and sisters</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Christian friends</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>consider the time of your calling:</strong> In Greek this clause is literally “Consider your calling.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The KJV translates this as an indicative clause: “ye see your calling.” It is alone in this among the major English versions, although it is supported by Barrett, p. 56. The imperative is supported by Fee p. 79, Thiselton p. 179.</span></span> Paul wanted the Corinthian believers to think about who they were when God called them to be his people. Specifically, he wanted them to remember that they had no high status or position in the world when God called them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Most of the first Corinthian believers were uneducated people, poor people, and slaves. However, they had become proud. Paul wanted to remind them that they had no reason to be proud of themselves. The only reason they had to be proud now came from their relationship with Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the time of your calling:</strong> The Greek phrase that BSB translates as <em>the time of your calling</em> is literally <em>your calling</em>. This phrase refers to the time when God called or invited the Corinthians to believe the gospel. In some languages, it may be more natural to state who called the Corinthians. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> called you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to say what God called the Corinthians to do. If that is true in your language, you may add the implied information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when God called you to be Christians (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when God called you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to follow Christ</span></p></blockquote><h4>1:26b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:26b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Not many of you were wise by human standards;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Not many of you were what most people consider wise.</p></li><li><p>According to human standards, not many of you were clever/wise.</p></li><li><p>The people of this world thought/considered very few of you to be wise people.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Not many of you were wise by human standards:</strong> In Greek this clause indicates/shows what the Corinthian people were originally like according to human standards. When the Corinthian believers were called, not many of them were considered wise by other people. Another way to translate this phrase is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>From the human point of view, few of you were wise (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>by human standards:</strong> In Greek this phrase is literally “according to the flesh.” This phrase is often used to contrast earthly, worldly standards with divine standards. Worldly people did not consider the Corinthian believers to be wise, influential, or noble people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to make these people the subject of the sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The people of this world didn’t think that many of you were wise. (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>1:26c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:26c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>not many were powerful;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Not many of you were powerful people.</p></li><li><p>Not many of you held power over other people.</p></li><li><p>Only a few of you had positions of power/influence.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not many were powerful:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>powerful</em> refers to those people who were powerful in society and politics, the prominent leaders in Corinth. Many languages have idioms for influential people. Some languages use phrases such as “big men” or “people with big names.” Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Not many of you had great influence. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>not many were influential (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You were not in powerful positions… (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>1:26d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:26d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>not many were of noble birth.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Not many of you were born into the higher classes of society.</p></li><li><p>Only a few of you were born into important/noble families.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not many were of noble birth:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>noble birth</em> refers to people whose parents are members of the ruling classes. Some languages have a term for “nobles” or “high caste” that can be used here. Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>not many were born to a privileged position (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You were not…in the upper social classes. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Not many of you came from important families. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You may have an idiom in your language for a privileged birth. If that is true you may use it here since Paul is talking generally. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He was <u>born with a silver spoon in his mouth</u>.</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:26b-d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">There are two ways to understand how the phrase “by human standards” is used:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is connected only to the word <u>wise</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The people of this world didn&apos;t think that many of you were wise.

(CEV) <em>(GW, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is connected to each part of the entire sentence, that is, <u>wise, influential</u>, and <u>of noble birth</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>From the human point of view few of you were wise or powerful or of high social standing (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1) since it has stronger support in the commentaries.</p></div>",

They should be united by true wisdom, the message of the cross.</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this section Paul wrote about a serious problem in the Corinthian church. The Corinthian believers were dividing up into competing groups. They were following whichever human leader they admired the most. Paul tried to solve this problem by reminding the Corinthians of the message of the cross. He wanted them to stop following human wisdom and to follow God’s wisdom.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1047001026\" data-endVerseId=\"1047001031\"><h3>Paragraph 1:26–31</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph Paul reminded the Corinthians that God did not choose them because they were wise or important. Instead, he deliberately chose people of no importance in this world. So the Corinthians had nothing to boast about, except what Christ had done for them.</p></div><h4>1:27–28</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the foolish things of the world…the weak things of the world…the lowly things of the world:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>of the world</em> occurs three times in verses 27 and 28. There are two different ways to interpret the phrase <em>of the world</em> here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “as the people of the world think, by worldly standards.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Ellingworth and Hatton p. 38, and Garland p, 76; Barrett p. 58.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>what the world considers nonsense… (GNT) <em>(GNT, NJB, NET, REB, GW, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “that part of the world that is characterized by the following quality.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Thiselton p. 184.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>what is foolish in the world… (RSV) <em>(RSV, BSB, NIV, KJV, NASB, ESV, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) for each of the three places where this phrase occurs. This is consistent with the negative use of the word <em>world</em> in this paragraph.</p><h4>1:27a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:27a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But God chose the foolish things of the world</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But God chose what <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people of</span> this world think of as foolish</p></li><li><p>On the contrary, God chose what seems foolish in the opinion of this world’s people.</p></li><li><p>Instead, God chose what seems to be nonsense according to the people/human standards of this world.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But God chose:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>But</em> indicates a strong contrast here. One would humanly expect God to choose wise, influential and noble people to follow Christ. Instead, he chose the weak and uneducated people. This conjunction can also be translated using other words that indicate contrast. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Instead, God chose… (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Yet…God has chosen… (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this in a way that is natural for your language so that this contrast is clear.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>foolish things:</strong> This phrase has a general meaning. It can include <em>foolish</em> people as well as <em>foolish</em> thoughts/plans and objects. Therefore it can include plans, such as God’s plan of salvation, and also objects, such as the cross of Christ. These seem foolish to unbelievers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Try to use an expression that can include uneducated, unsophisticated, simple people, as well as objects or ideas. If you must choose between referring to people or to things/objects, it is recommended that you refer to people. This best fits the context of this verse.</p><h4>1:27b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:27b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to shame the wise;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>in order to humiliate wise people.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He used foolishness</span> to dishonor/disgrace the wise people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the world</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s purposely used foolish things</span> in order to show <span data-bnType=\"implied\">everyone</span> that those wise people do not have <span data-bnType=\"implied\">true</span> wisdom.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to shame the wise:</strong> This is a purpose clause. God chose the so-called foolish things and people, <u>in order to</u> shame the wise. The phrase <em>to shame the wise</em> here means to show that the wise people are wrong.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Wise people may proudly think that God chooses or prefers them because they are wise. However, God instead chose people who are not wise. He chose those not wise so that wise people could not proudly say, “God chose me because I am wise.” Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to put to shame the wise (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to put wise people to shame (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the wise:</strong> The phrase <em>the wise</em> here refers to people who are wise and clever in their own eyes. They may also be wise in the eyes of the world. These may be people who view themselves as wise intellectuals. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who think they are wise (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>1:27c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:27c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>God chose the weak things of the world</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>God chose what this world’s people think of as weak</p></li><li><p>God chose what seems powerless, unimportant according to our human standards.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the weak things:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translated as <em>weak things</em> here refers to both things and people that appear to be powerless. It is the opposite of “powerful” in 1:26c. It means people who are not in important positions. However, it does not refer to people who are physically weak.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul does not mean that the people God chose are really physically <em>weak</em>. He means that “God chose people whom most people in the world <u>consider</u> to be unimportant.” In other words, he means those “…whom most people in the world do not consider to be leaders/prominent.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated <em>weak</em> in 1:25b.</p><h4>1:27d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:27d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to shame the strong.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>in order to shame people who are powerful.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">His purpose was</span> to show that strong/powerful people do not have true strength/power.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to shame the strong:</strong> The phrase the <em>strong</em> here refers to strong people. In other words, those who are influential, prominent people, leaders in the community (1:26c). Paul was not referring to people who are physically strong. As in 1:27b, the verb <em>shame</em> here means to show that someone is in the wrong.</p>",

Paul here referred to things and people who are not esteemed or considered important.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and despised things:</strong> The <em>despised things</em> are the people, and things, which most people despise or look down upon. They are “scorned” or “not honored.”</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:28a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to separate this verse part into two phrases.

Some Greek texts contain the word <em>and</em>. Some do not have the word. According to the UBS Greek text, the original Greek likely did not contain the word the BSB has translated as <em>and</em>. If your language would normally use a connecting word here, you may use it. However, it is not necessary. It is also possible to begin this verse part using other words. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>even</u> things that are not,… (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the things that are not:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translated as <em>the things that are not</em> literally is “the things that do not exist.” It refers to people, things, and objects that are considered worthless and of no value. There are different ways to interpret how this phrase functions in this sentence:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is a summary description of the things that God chose. It is not a separate category. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>27</sup>No, God chose…<sup>28</sup>those who by human standards are common and contemptible—indeed those who count for nothing—to reduce to nothing all those that do count for something. (NJB) <em>(REB, NASB, RSV, GNT, NJB, ESV, NLT, NET, CEV, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to a separate group or category.

It describes the things that God chose.</p><h4>1:28c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:28c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to nullify the things that are,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>in order to bring to nothing the things that are</p></li><li><p>to abolish/do away with what is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">valued by the world</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to nullify the things that are:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>nullify</em> means “to put an end to something, to do away with it, replace it with something more powerful.” Here it indicates that God purposely ignores or puts aside what the people of this world think of as important. Thus, God shows what is really important to him. People of this world think it is important to be rich and powerful and clever. God says that those things are not important to him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the things that are:</strong> In Greek this phrase is literally “the things that exist.” This is the opposite of the things talked about in the previous verse part as “things that are not.”</p>",

So the Corinthians had nothing to boast about, except what Christ had done for them.</p></div><h4>1:30a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:30a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>It is because of Him that you are in Christ Jesus,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>No, you are united with Christ Jesus only because of what God has done.</p></li><li><p>God is the one who unites you to Christ Jesus.</p></li><li><p>Instead, it is because of what God has done for you that you are in Christ Jesus,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>It is because of Him that you are in Christ Jesus:</strong> Paul explained that a person is not called to belong to Christ Jesus because he/she is an important person. Rather, God calls people to be in Christ. It is as a gift from God that we are joined to Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>because of Him:</strong> In Greek this phrase is literally “from him.” It is by God’s choice and act that humans are joined to Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in Christ Jesus:</strong> The phrase <em>in Christ Jesus</em> means “in union with Christ Jesus,” or “in fellowship with Christ Jesus.” This is a description of everyone who trusts Jesus and thus belongs to him. See the Notes on 1:2b and 1:4b.</p><h4>1:30b-e</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>wisdom…righteousness…holiness…redemption:</strong> There are different ways to understand how these four words relate to each other:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><em>wisdom</em> is a general word. The three other words are more specific. The BSB shows/indicates this by putting a colon at the end of 1:30b. In other words, Paul first says that Christ became “wisdom from God” for us. Then he explains what he means about wisdom by saying that Christ became <em>righteousness</em>, <em>holiness</em>, and <em>redemption</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God, in other words, our righteousness, holiness and redemption. <em>(BSB, NIV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Each of the four words represents a separate thing. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He sent Christ Jesus to save us and to make us wise, acceptable, and holy. (CEV) <em>(KJV, NASB, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This appears the most likely interpretation because of the way that the Greek sentence is constructed. The <em>wisdom</em> from God is God’s plan to make his people righteous and holy and to redeem them.</p><h4>1:30b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:30b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who has become for us wisdom from God:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ Jesus</span> is God’s wise way to save us<sup>(incl)</sup>.</p></li><li><p>It is through Christ Jesus that God wisely acted to save us<sup>(incl)</sup>.</p></li><li><p>Christ Jesus is God’s wise way to save people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from sin and death</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who has become for us wisdom from God:</strong> There are two different interpretations of the Greek clause that the BSB translated as <em>who has become for us wisdom from God</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “Christ Jesus became God’s wise way to save us.” Christ is the way of salvation that God in his wisdom has given to us.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Fee pp. 85–87 and Garland p. 79: “The crucified Christ became the manifestation of God’s wisdom, which here refers to God’s long-established plan for the world’s salvation.”</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who became for us wisdom from God (NET) <em>(BSB, NET, NIV, NCV, NLT, ESV, NJB, KJV, NASB, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means that Christ Jesus made us wise. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He sent Christ Jesus…to make us wise…. (CEV) <em>(GNT, CEV, GW, REB, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) because it has stronger support in English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In 1:24c, Paul also said that Christ is the “wisdom of God.” You will probably want to translate the phrase <em>wisdom from God</em> here in 1:30b similar to the way you translated “wisdom of God” in 1:24c.</p><h4>1:30c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:30c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>our righteousness,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>That is, God put us<sup>(incl)</sup> right,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ made</span> us<sup>(incl)</sup> right with God,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>our righteousness:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>righteousness</em> could also be translated “justification.” The phrase <em>our righteousness</em> here means that Christ made it possible for us to be justified. He made it possible for humans/mankind to be made right/just in God’s sight. You will probably want to translate this using your key term for “justify.” Christ Jesus shows us that God is wise by making it possible for us to become acceptable to God. He has put us in a right relationship with God. For example;</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>By him we are put right with God. (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>1:30d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:30d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>holiness,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>we<sup>(incl)</sup> became God’s holy people,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">he</span> set us<sup>(incl)</sup> apart to be God’s own people,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>holiness:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>holiness</em> can also be translated as “sanctification.” It means “to be set apart for God.” Paul was saying that through Christ Jesus, God has set us apart to be God’s own people. See notes on 1:2b and 1:2c. Other ways to translate this word is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we…have been made holy… (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>1:30e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:30e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and redemption.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and by him we<sup>(incl)</sup> are redeemed.</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he</span> set us<sup>(incl)</sup> free/freed us <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from sin/evil</span>.</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">through Christ</span> we are ransomed from sin and death.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>redemption:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>redemption</em> means “to set someone free, often by paying a price.” Here it indicates that Christ has set his people free by paying their penalty for sin. That is, Christ released them from sin. Christ did that by dying on the cross. Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>our ransom from sin (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we…are set free (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he freed us from sin (NLT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:30</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In 1:30 Paul said that Christ Jesus “became” (past tense in the Greek) for us “wisdom,” “righteousness,” “holiness,” and “redemption.” Christ Jesus did these things for us in the past, when he became a man and died on the cross and rose again. However, we are experiencing these things at the present time. So some English versions use the present tense instead of the past. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>has become for us wisdom from God… (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we become God’s holy people and are set free. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use the tense that which tense would communicate the correct meaning in your language.</p></div>",

Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And so</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As the result of all that Christ has done for us</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as it is written:</strong> Paul used this phrase to introduce a quotation from the Old Testament. See 1:19a. In some languages it may be helpful to make it explicit that the words which follow are quoted exactly from the Scriptures. They are repeated from God’s Word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as the Scriptures say</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a prophet</span> wrote in God’s book</p></blockquote><h4>1:31b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:31b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Let him who boasts boast in the Lord.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“If someone boasts, he should only boast about the Lord.”</p></li><li><p>“People should not brag about anything except what the Lord/Christ has done for them.”</p></li><li><p>The only thing that someone can truthfully boast/brag about is how Christ/the Lord saved him/her <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from eternal death</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Let him who boasts boast in the Lord:</strong> This is a paraphrase/quotation from Jeremiah 9:24.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If you are going to boast, the only thing you can boast about is what the Lord has done for you.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In this context boasting is spoken of in a positive/good way. It is good to speak well of what the Lord has done for us. However, your word for <em>boast</em> may only have a negative meaning. If that is true, then you may need to follow one of these examples:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So if you want to brag, do what the Scriptures say and brag about the Lord. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>People should not boastfully say, “This and this are the reasons why I am better than other people.” No, they should say, “God has done this and this to save me.”</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:31a-b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to change the order of the verse parts in this verse. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>31b</sup>If someone wants to talk with pride, he should talk proudly only about/of what Christ has done for him, <sup>31a</sup>just as God’s book tells us to.</p></blockquote></div>",

He used himself as an example of one who boasted only of what the Lord had done (1:31).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>came to you:</strong> Consider whether it is more natural to translate this phrase using a word meaning <em>came</em> or a word meaning “went.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>brothers:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>brothers</em> here refers to all the believers in Corinth.</p><h4>2:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I did not come with eloquence or wisdom</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I did not speak to you using important-sounding speech and I did not try to sound wise</p></li><li><p>I did not use big/fancy words, and I did no talk to you as though I knew more than others</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I did not come with eloquence or wisdom:</strong> Paul indicated that when he spoke in Corinth, he did not make eloquent, clever speeches or show off his learning. He used normal words and a normal way of speaking. In some languages it may be more natural to translate the phrase <em>with eloquence or wisdom</em> as a clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I did not come speaking eloquently or showing off my great wisdom.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I didn’t use big words or try to sound wise. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>eloquence or wisdom:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>eloquence or wisdom</em> is literally “excellence of speech or [excellence] of wisdom.” “Excellence of speech” or <em>eloquence</em> refers to speaking in a complicated and elegant way in order to sound clever and important. “Excellence…of wisdom” or <em>wisdom</em> here refers to human cleverness or learning. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I did not use big words and great learning.

It is from the UBS Greek text. Thus the NRSV is used in the Display.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word that some versions translated as “mystery” is used in a special way here.

I was shaking/quiver with fear.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I came to you:</strong> As in 2:1a, the Greek text begins this sentence with a word meaning “And I (emphatic),” or “And I, for my part.” In 2:1 Paul was again talking about himself. He described the qualities he did not use as he spoke to the Corinthians. Now he began to describe how he did speak to them. There are two ways to interpret the phrase <em>I came to you</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to the time when he was with them in Corinth. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was with you… (RSV) <em>(KJV, NASB, RSV, ESV, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to the time when Paul first arrived there in Corinth. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I came to you… (NRSV) <em>(BSB, CEV, NIV, NRSV, GW, NLT, NCV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). The context suggests that Paul was thinking of his entire stay with the Corinthians.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in weakness and fear, and with much trembling:</strong> Paul said that he experienced three things: weakness, fear, and much trembling. The English versions combine these words in different ways. Also, some versions translate all three words as nouns, and others translate one or more as a verb or an adjective. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And I was with you in weakness and in fear and with much trembling. (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was weak and fearful and trembling. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was weak and trembled all over with fear. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I felt weak and so afraid that I was shaking.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use the combination of grammatical forms that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in weakness:</strong> Paul says that when he was in Corinth, he was there <em>in weakness</em>. There are two ways to interpret this phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Paul was talking about feeling inadequate or not able to do his job of preaching well.</p></li><li><p>Paul was talking about being physically weak.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Both of these interpretations are possible. From Acts 18:9–11, we know that when Paul was in Corinth he was afraid that he could not do his job of preaching well enough. From 2 Corinthians, we also know that some people in Corinth thought that Paul was not a good speaker. They thought that he did not speak in a powerful way. (See for example 2 Corinthians 10:10.)</p><p data-indent=\"2\">And from his letter to the Galatians, it appears that Paul did have some physical ailment. So it would be good to make your translation general so that it includes all different types of weakness.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In 2:3 Paul wrote about the strong negative feelings he had when he first arrived in Corinth. Why did he feel that way? There may have been several reasons. The most important reason was that he greatly respected God’s message about Christ and knew that <u>God</u> wanted the Corinthians to believe that message. So since God sent him there to tell it, he had the big responsibility of telling it in such a way that God himself could cause them to believe it. Also he understood how much the Corinthians liked to hear clever ideas and talk. But that did not make them want to change their ways. And many of them did live in sinful ways. So he knew it would not be easy for anyone to tell God’s message there. Also Paul was concerned/worried about other things at the time. He was probably remembering how much he and his fellow workers had suffered in Philippi and Thessalonica and Berea, and how the people in Athens did not really respect his message. He may have felt alone in Corinth because he had sent Timothy back to Thessalonica to encourage the believers there and had left Silas behind in Berea for the same reason.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>much trembling:</strong> The word <em>trembling</em> indicates that Paul felt afraid in some way. If a literal translation will not communicate this meaning, you may need to be more explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>great trepidation (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>very nervous (GW)</p></blockquote>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When I spoke to you and proclaimed my message to you.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul was not necessarily referring to two different things here. He was probably using two words in order to refer to both the content and the style of his preaching. Here are some suggestions of how to translate this phrase so that it is clear that it refers to only one thing:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The word I spoke, the gospel I proclaimed… (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When I preached my message to you…</p></blockquote><h4>2:4b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:4b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>were not with persuasive words of wisdom,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I did</span> not tell you my own wise thoughts and I did not speak in clever arguments.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I did</span> not try to persuade/convince you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to believe me</span> by using wise thoughts and clever arguments.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>were not with persuasive words of wisdom:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>persuasive words of wisdom</em> is in different forms in different Greek manuscripts. Scholars do not agree about the exact form or meaning. Most major English versions follow the same text as the BSB.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The UBS Greek NT gives this a D rating, and enclosed the word logois in square brackets.</span></span> There are two ways to interpret the phrase <em>persuasive words of wisdom</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to using clever words and thoughts in order to persuade people. It refers to <u>what one talks about</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to convince by philosophical argument, (NJB) <em>(NJB, REB, NCV, KJV, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to talking in a clever or skillful way to try to persuade listeners.

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This agrees with what Paul said in 1:17c.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>persuasive:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>persuasive</em> describes words that attempt to persuade or convince the listeners of something. Some English versions translate it as a verb and use a general object. For example;</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>persuade people (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sway you (REB)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:4a-b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to translate the main verb in 2:4a-b as a negative.

However, he was not explicitly saying that at this point.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>of this age:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>of this age</em> means “of this present world order.” Refer to your translation of 1:20c. The same phrase occurs in verse 1:20c. Check your translation of that verse. An example is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to the governing powers/government/rulers of this present time…</p></blockquote><h4>2:6d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:6d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who are coming to nothing.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>All of those rulers will soon lose their power.</p></li><li><p>All those rulers will soon no longer have any authority/importance/significance.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who are coming to nothing:</strong> The Greek word that is translated <em>coming to nothing</em> is the same word that Paul used in 1:28d. In that verse it was translated as “nullify.” Here Paul was indicating that the rulers of this world were losing their power. It might appear that they were very powerful. However, it was certain that they would eventually/soon become powerless. Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who are doomed to perish (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they will certainly be destroyed</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who are losing their power (NCV)</p></blockquote>",

The Spirit makes God’s thoughts known only to people/believers who are under the Spirit’s control. These believers try to obey the Spirit in following God’s ways.</p></div><h4>2:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>No, we speak of the mysterious and hidden wisdom of God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>No, the wise message we<sup>(excl)</sup> tell is God’s. It concerns his secret plan which he did not previously reveal to mankind/anyone.</p></li><li><p>Instead, we<sup>(excl)</sup> talk about the wise plan that God formed/made. Until now no one knew about it because God did not make it known/reveal it to anyone.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>No:</strong> The BSB uses the word <em>No</em> to translate a strong contrast word in the Greek text. Paul used the word to indicate the contrast between wisdom of this age and the wisdom of God. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But (RSV, NRSV, KJV, ESV, NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Instead (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Several English versions do not explicitly translate this word. You should translate this word in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we speak:</strong> The pronoun <em>we</em> here probably refers to Paul and the other apostles and Christian teachers, as in 2:6a. Follow the same interpretation here that you did there.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the mysterious and hidden wisdom of God:</strong> The Greek text that the BSB translates as <em>the mysterious and hidden wisdom of God</em> is more literally “the hidden wisdom of God in a mystery.” The word <em>God</em> is emphatic. Paul was not speaking about the wisdom that is from the world, but about wisdom that is from God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>mysterious</em> here refers to something that no one can know unless God reveals it to them. The <em>mysterious…wisdom of God</em> means “God’s secret plan that he wisely made/formed.” Another example is, “the plan that God made with his wisdom, and which no one fully knew about.” Paul was referring to God’s plan to send Christ to die on the cross to save his people. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s wisdom, secret and hidden, (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a secret and hidden wisdom of God, (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>hidden wisdom of God:</strong> This phrase says something more about God’s wise plan to help mankind. The way it was <em>hidden</em> is that God had not revealed or told it to people before this. In some languages it may not be possible to use the word <em>hidden</em> in this figurative sense. You may need to make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>this wisdom was unknown to people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God had not revealed this wise plan to people</p></blockquote><h4>2:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>which He destined for our glory before time began.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>We<sup>(excl)</sup> tell about God’s plan to give us<sup>(incl)</sup> a glorious/wonderful life. Before God made the world he decided to do this for us.</p></li><li><p>It is what God long ago decided to do even before he started to make anything. And it includes all the surpassingly good things he intends to do for us<sup>(incl)</sup>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>which He destined:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>destined</em> means “to decide something ahead of time.” Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God decided (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he had already chosen (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for our glory:</strong> The phrase <em>for our glory</em> explains God’s purpose or intention. God formed his wise plan <u>in order</u> to give glory to us, that is, to believers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>our:</strong> The Greek pronoun that the BSB translates as <em>our</em> refers here to Paul and his readers, and to everyone who believes in the Lord Jesus Christ. If you must choose between an inclusive and an exclusive pronoun, you should use an inclusive pronoun here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>glory:</strong> Here <em>glory</em> refers to three things. It refers to the joy and honor of knowing God, to being made like Jesus Christ, and to being in his presence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for our joy and honor</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It may not be natural for your language to use an abstract noun here. If that is true, you may need to translate glory as a verb or an adjective. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that we should be glorified</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to make us glorious</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>before time began:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>before time began</em> is literally “before the ages.” It indicates that God thought up his wise plan before he started to make this world. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>even before the world was made (GNT)</p></blockquote>",

The rulers of the world did not understand God’s plan, but God revealed it to those who love him (2:10a). The quotation that immediately follows is thus parenthetical. If it is unnatural in your language to have a contrasting conjunction before this parenthetical quotation, you may leave it untranslated. For example,</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is just as the Scriptures say…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as it is written:</strong> The phrase <em>as it is written</em> generally introduces a quotation from the Old Testament Scriptures. Here, however, it does not introduce a direct quote from any single OT passage. Paul probably put together these thoughts from several verses, such as the Greek translation of Isaiah 64:4 and 65:17.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Thiselton pp. 250–52 for a discussion of this issue.</span></span> Since this is not a specific quotation from one passage, it may be best not to use quotation marks. However, you need to indicate that Paul was referring to some written passages of Scripture. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Scripture speaks of ‘things beyond our seeing…’ (REB)</p></blockquote><h4>2:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“No eye has seen, no ear has heard,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“No one has ever seen or heard about it.</p></li><li><p>“Nobody has ever seen or heard about it.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>No eye has seen:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>No eye has seen</em> is a figure of speech that means “No person has ever seen.” The object of the verb is given in 2:9c. In some languages it may be more natural to use a general object here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No one has ever seen this (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>no ear has heard:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>no ear has heard</em> means “no person has ever heard.” It refers to hearing news or information about something. In some languages it may be more natural to use an object here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and no one has ever heard about it (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>2:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>no heart has imagined, what God has prepared for those who love Him.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>No one has ever imagined/thought of all of the things that God has prepared for the people who love him.</p></li><li><p>Nobody has even dreamed of/imagined the wonderful things that God has planned to do for <span data-bnType=\"implied\">us</span><sup>(incl)</sup>, the people who love him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>no heart has imagined:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>no heart has imagined</em> is more literally “it has not come upon the heart of man.” In Paul’s time people thought that the <em>heart</em> was the center of their inner life. They considered the <em>heart</em> to be the source of thinking and feeling. Therefore this phrase means that nobody had ever thought about God’s wise plan before God revealed it to people. You should translate this phrase in a way that is natural in your own language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No one has ever imagined… (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>what no one ever thought could happen… (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>what God has prepared for those who love Him:</strong> This phrase tells what no one had ever seen, heard, or thought before. It is implied that the things God has prepared are wonderful and too good to imagine. In some languages it may be more natural to make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the wonderful things</span> that God has prepared for those who love him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the very good things</span> God has made ready for those who love him</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:9b-c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to change the order of 2:9b-c.

The contrast is between what unbelievers are not able to understand and what God revealed to believers through his Spirit. God had allowed believers to know what he has prepared for those who love him. In some languages it may not be natural to have a conjunction here as well as in 2:9a. It may be more natural to leave it untranslated here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God has revealed those things to us by his Spirit. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God has revealed it to us:</strong> The BSB has used the pronoun <em>it</em> to refer to “God’s secret wisdom” as in 2:7. It also refers to the things that “God has prepared for those that love him” in 2:9.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>us:</strong> The Greek pronoun that the BSB translates as <em>us</em> here refers to Paul and the other apostles, and also to all believers. God had revealed the gospel to Paul and the apostles first, but then they shared this gospel with the Corinthians. Through the Holy Spirit they had all come to know the good things that God was preparing for them. You may need to choose between an inclusive and an exclusive pronoun <em>us</em> here.

It introduces Paul’s basis for saying that God’s Spirit was the one who had revealed God’s hidden wisdom. The BSB and some other English versions do not translate this conjunction.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here is a way to translate this conjunction:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For (NET, NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">You should introduce this part of the verse in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The Spirit searches all things:</strong> In 2:10a-b, Paul said that God revealed his wise plan through the Holy Spirit. Here in 2:10c-11, Paul explained how the Spirit knows God’s plan and reveals it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>searches:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>searches</em> is figurative. It means that he knows all about everything. He is aware of everything. It does not mean that the Spirit goes around looking for information. He is not “searching” as if there were things he was trying to find out. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>For nothing is hidden from the Spirit.

If that is not possible or natural in your language, follow the BSB or a similar example.</p><h4>2:11a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:11a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For who among men knows the thoughts of man except his own spirit within him?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For who knows all about a person’s thoughts? Only that person’s spirit knows his own thoughts.</p></li><li><p>Consider this: the only one who can know what is in someone’s heart is that person himself.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translated as <em>For</em> introduces the grounds for Paul’s statements in 2:10a-b. Paul said that God has revealed the mystery to us by his Spirit. That statement explains how we can know the deep things of God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who among men knows the thoughts of man except his own spirit within him?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. Paul used this rhetorical question to emphasize that no one knows a person’s thoughts except his or her own spirit. No one can know what another person is thinking about unless that person tells someone. Some ways to translate this emphasis are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>what person knows a man’s thoughts except the spirit of the man which is in him? (RSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a question with the answer. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Who knows the thoughts that another person has? Only a person’s spirit that lives within him knows his thoughts. (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is only our own spirit within us that knows all about us. (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">You should translate this rhetorical question in the way that is most natural in your language for expressing emphasis.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>men…man…his…him:</strong> The Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>men</em>, <em>man</em>, <em>his</em>, and <em>him</em> here refer to human beings, people in general. Paul was referring to anyone and everyone. Therefore the pronouns “our” and “us” may be used. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It is only our own spirit within us that knows all about us, (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions use second-person pronouns. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You are the only one who knows what is in your own mind (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>except his own spirit within him:</strong> The word <em>spirit</em> here means a person’s inner being, his own spiritual nature. A person knows his own thoughts, attitudes, intentions. Only the person himself can tell others those things. It may not be natural in your language to say that a person’s spirit knows what he is thinking. You may need to use an idiom or some other way to tell about a person’s inner being. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The only one who knows what is in a person’s heart is that person himself.</p></blockquote><h4>2:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So too, no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>In the same way, the only one who knows the thoughts/plans in God’s heart is God’s Spirit.</p></li><li><p>It is the same <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with/concerning God</span>. No one understands/knows about God’s thoughts except God’s Spirit.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So too, no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God:</strong> Here Paul used an expression similar to 2:11a to indicate the close similarity between how a person’s spirit knows that person’s thoughts and how God’s Spirit knows God’s thoughts. However, he was not saying that the relationship is exactly the same. Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So too, no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God. (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and no one can know God’s thoughts except God’s own Spirit (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>except the Spirit of God:</strong> God’s own Spirit is the only one who knows God’s nature, thoughts, and intentions. Therefore, only God’s Spirit can cause people to know God. God’s Spirit helped the first believers understand God’s thoughts. He also helps all believers understand God’s thoughts.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:11a-b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In many languages it is not possible to use the same word for a person’s “spirit” (2:11a) and God’s Holy “Spirit” (2:11b). In some languages the clearest way to translate “the man’s spirit within him” is “the person himself.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Only the person himself can know the thoughts in his own mind. So also only God’s own Spirit can know what is in God’s mind.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You are the only one who knows what is in your own mind, and God’s Spirit is the only one who knows what is in God’s mind.

He wanted them to stop following human wisdom and to follow God’s wisdom.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1047002006\" data-endVerseId=\"1047002013\"><h3>Paragraph 2:6–13</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph Paul wrote about God’s wisdom, that is, his wise plan to send Christ to save people. Those who follow or depend on human thinking/wisdom do not want to hear or accept God’s message. It is only God’s Spirit who can cause people to know and accept God’s thoughts/plans as wise. The Spirit makes God’s thoughts known only to people/believers who are under the Spirit’s control. These believers try to obey the Spirit in following God’s ways.</p></div><h4>2:12a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:12a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>We have not received the spirit of the world,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>We<sup>(incl)</sup> have not received <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the same spirit/thoughts</span> that the people in this world have received.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> did not give us<sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the same thoughts</span> that this world’s people have.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek, this verse part is connected to the previous verse part with a conjunction. Several English versions translate this conjunction as “Now.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now we have received… (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other versions do not explicitly translate the conjunction. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We have not received… (NIV, GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul used this conjunction to introduce a further step in his argument. You should introduce this verse part in a way that is natural in your language, for introducing an additional part of an argument. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And we have received… (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>We have not received the spirit of the world:</strong> This clause indicates that Paul and others who have God’s Spirit do not think in the same way. Unbelievers can think only according to human wisdom. They have different attitudes and values.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We have not received the same mind/thoughts that the other people of this world have received.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>We have not received:</strong> The phrase <em>We have not received</em> can also be translated as “we have not been given.” In some languages it may be more natural to make God explicit here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> did not give us…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> did not cause us to have…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>We:</strong> The Greek pronoun that the BSB translates as <em>We</em> could refer to two different groups of people.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to Paul along with all other believers, as in 2:7b and (probably) 2:10a. This is inclusive.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Fee pp. 112–13, fn. 63, and Garland p. 99.</span></span></p></li><li><p>It refers to Paul and his fellow workers, as in 2:6a and 2:7a. This is exclusive.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See W. Kaiser, quoted by Fee, p. 113 fn. 63.</span></span></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul may have been thinking primarily of himself and the other apostles, but he was certainly not excluding other believers. So you should research which pronoun is most natural in your language. If you must choose, it is recommended that you follow option (1). What Paul was saying is true in principle of all believers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the spirit of the world:</strong> The phrase <em>the spirit of the world</em> here refers to the way this world’s people think about things. It does not refer to an evil spirit or demon. Paul was indicating that unbelievers depend on their own ability to think about things. They have no way of knowing God’s way of thinking about things.</p><h4>2:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but the Spirit who is from God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Rather, we have received the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Holy</span> Spirit of God</p></li><li><p>Instead, God gave us<sup>(incl)</sup> the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Holy</span> Spirit.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but:</strong> There is a contrast here. The contrast is between receiving the spirit of the world and receiving the Spirit of God. All believers receive the Spirit of God. The BSB indicates this contrast with the conjunction <em>but</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this contrast are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we didn’t receive the spirit that belongs to the world. <u>Instead</u>, we received the Spirit who comes from God (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we have received this Spirit from God, not the spirit of the world (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Spirit who is from God:</strong> Some words from the previous clause are implied but not repeated here. It may be more natural in your language to include some or all of the implied words. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">we received</span> the Spirit who is from God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to translate this phrase as a separate sentence with God as the subject. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God has given us his own Spirit.</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:12a-b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to change the order of 2:12a-b. You may need to put the positive statement first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12b</sup>But God has given us his Spirit. <sup>12a</sup>That’s why we don’t think the same way that the people of this world think. (CEV)</p></blockquote><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:12a-b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may not be possible to use the same word for the “spirit” that is from the world and the “Spirit” of God. The “spirit” of the world means to have a worldly mind or way of thinking. In contrast, the word “Spirit” refers to the Holy Spirit of God. It is not necessary to use the same word in your translation for these two different meanings of “spirit.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But God has given us his Spirit. That’s why we don’t think the same way that the people of this world think. (CEV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that we may understand what God has freely given us.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that we<sup>(incl)</sup> can know/understand everything that God has given to us<sup>(incl)</sup> by his grace.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He gave us</span><sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his Holy Spirit</span> in order that we<sup>(incl)</sup> would be able to understand <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the good things</span> that he has freely/graciously given to us.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that we may understand what God has freely given us:</strong> This is a purpose clause. It indicates God’s purpose in giving the Holy Spirit to believers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we may understand:</strong> You should translate the pronoun <em>we</em> here in the same way that you did in 2:12a. Paul was probably thinking first of himself and the other apostles. However, he was not excluding the believers to whom he was writing.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>what God has freely given us:</strong> In this phrase the pronoun <em>us</em> is clearly inclusive. God has generously given the Holy Spirit and all the blessings of the gospel to all believers.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>freely given:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>freely given</em> is a verb that is related to the word “grace.” It means, “the things that God has graciously/kindly given” or “the things that God has given because of his grace.”</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:12a-c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to reorder this verse. You may want to put 2:12c before 2:12b, and 2:12b before 2:12a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12c</sup>But we can understand the things that God has freely given to us, <sup>12b</sup>because we have received the Spirit that is from God. <sup>12a</sup>We do not think like the people in this world who do not know God.</p></blockquote></div>",

The Corinthian believers were dividing up into competing groups. They were following whichever human leader they admired the most.

He wanted them to stop following human wisdom and to follow God’s wisdom.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1047002014\" data-endVerseId=\"1047002016\"><h3>Paragraph 2:14–16</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph Paul contrasted two types of people. They are the people who have the Spirit of God, and those people who do not have the Spirit of God. People who do not have the Spirit of God cannot understand or accept spiritual things (2:14). People who have God’s Spirit can understand spiritual things, because they are able to think like Christ Jesus (2:15–16).</p></div><h4>2:15a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:15a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The spiritual man judges all things,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>A person who has the Spirit is able to judge/examine/evaluate everything.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">On the other hand,</span> people who have received the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Holy</span> Spirit can understand/examine everything.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek text this verse part includes a conjunction that indicates a contrast. The contrast is between the person without the Spirit and the man who has the spirit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>But</u> he who is spiritual appraises all things, (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Whoever has the Spirit, <u>however</u>, is able… (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">If it is natural in your language, you may wish to indicate this contrast as in the examples above.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The spiritual man judges all things:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>judges</em> is a form of the same verb that is translated as “discerned” in 2:14d. The man in whom God’s Spirit lives is able to evaluate and learn all about God’s plan of salvation. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Whoever has the Spirit…is able to judge the value of everything (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Spiritual people evaluate everything (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>all things:</strong> Paul did not explain what he meant by <em>all things</em>. Some scholars suggest that he was referring to all things that are from the Holy Spirit. Others suggest that he meant all sorts of things in general. It is recommended that you translate this literally, as do most English versions.</p><h4>2:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but he himself is not subject to anyone’s judgment.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But people who do not have the Spirit cannot judge/evaluate the people who do have the Spirit.</p></li><li><p>And yet the ways/thoughts of a person who has the Holy Spirit cannot be judged or evaluated by anyone else.</p></li><li><p>And yet no unbeliever can judge the ways/thoughts of a person who has the Holy Spirit and decide whether what he/she is doing or thinking is right or wrong.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he himself is not subject to anyone’s judgment:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>subject to…judgment</em> is a passive. It is a form of the same verb that is used in 2:15a and 2:14d. Paul was saying that <u>a person without the Spirit</u> is not able to examine and evaluate a person in whom the Spirit lives.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Paul does not mean that a man in whom God’s Spirit lives does not need discipline and advice from his spiritual leaders and that he does not need to obey God’s moral laws. But he does mean that the person who is trusting his own clever thoughts is not able to examine and make judgments about the person who listens to and obeys the Spirit. A person who listens to God’s Spirit does not need to fear criticism from unbelievers or immature believers who do not listen to God’s Spirit (compare 3:3). Evidently some believers among the Corinthians were acting like unbelievers and were finding fault with Paul and did not want to follow his teachings.</span></span> He will not evaluate such a person correctly, nor be able to appreciate his spiritual value.

If someone does not know God’s thoughts, then he cannot give God any advice. Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>so that</u> he can teach him? (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>that</u> he may instruct him? (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, in some languages it may be more natural to translate this as a separate question. Some versions leave the fact that it is a result clause implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Who is able to give him advice? (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Who has been able to teach him? (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>instruct Him:</strong> The phrase <em>instruct Him</em> refers to giving advice to or counseling the Lord.

It is not the answer implied by the original author in the original context in Isaiah.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we have the mind of Christ:</strong> The emphasis in this statement is on the word <em>we</em>. Paul and other believers, in contrast to those without the Spirit, do have the mind of Christ. The pronoun <em>we</em> here refers to all believers, or at least to all mature believers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">All of God’s people are potentially able to understand spiritual things in a way similar to the way Christ knows them. Believers are able to understand because the Spirit is in them. People who are controlled by the Holy Spirit understand God’s plans and God’s ways in the same way that Christ does. Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we who are spiritual have the very thoughts of Christ (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We are those who have the mind of Christ. (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the mind of Christ:</strong> In 2:16a-b Paul quoted from Isaiah 40:13, where it says “the mind of the Lord.” In 2:16c Paul said <em>the mind of Christ</em>, since he thought of Jesus Christ as the Lord (Yahweh) of the OT. He meant that the same Holy Spirit who guides the thoughts of Christ also guides the thoughts of believers. Therefore, believers can understand spiritual truths the same way that Christ does. They can also understand God’s wise plans.</p>",

He was talking about how he taught the Corinthians when he was in Corinth. You may need to make this explicit in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When I was with you I couldn’t talk to you as I would to spiritual people. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I:</strong> As in 2:1a, the Greek text begins with a word that can be translated “And I (emphatic),” or “And I, for my part.” Paul used it here to start to talk about himself. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>As a matter of fact,…I… (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>as spiritual:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>spiritual</em> describes people who are controlled and guided by God’s Holy Spirit.

(GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>worldly:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>worldly</em> comes from the noun meaning “flesh.” Here it refers to people who live as most people do, following their own natural human desires.

He was comparing the beginning teachings from God’s message to <em>milk</em>. In some languages it may be necessary to make some of this information explicit.

(NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I taught you simply, as a mother gives only milk to her baby.</p></blockquote><h4>3:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>not solid food,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I did not give/feed you solid/adult food,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I did</span> not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">talk to you</span> about things that are difficult to understand. Such teachings are like food for adults.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not solid food:</strong> Paul contrasted the solid food that adults eat with milk, which is the only food babies are able to eat. The phrase <em>not solid food</em> is a short way of saying “I did not give you solid food to eat.” This is also a metaphor. Paul was saying that some teachings about God are like <em>solid food</em>. They are like solid food in the sense that only mature people can receive them and benefit from them. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I did not give you anything solid to eat.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I did not teach you things that are only appropriate for people who have strong/adult faith.</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:2a-b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The Greek text uses the same verb for both verse parts. However, in some languages this may not be natural or possible, and you may need to use separate verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2a</sup>I caused you to drink milk. <sup>2b</sup>I did not cause you to eat solid food.</p></blockquote></div><h4>3:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for you were not yet ready for solid food.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because you were not yet able to receive/accept such food/teaching.</p></li><li><p>And at that time you were not ready to learn/understand them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for you were not yet ready for solid food:</strong> Paul gave the reason why he had not given them solid food. Just as a baby is not yet ready for solid food, so when the Corinthians first became believers, they were not ready to understand difficult teaching. Paul was not blaming them for this or criticizing them at this point. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for you were not yet ready for it <span data-bnType=\"implied\">at that time</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because you were not able to take solid food (NCV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:2a-c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to follow the CEV and combine 3:2b-c:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>[<sup>2a</sup>So I had to treat you like babies and feed you milk.] <sup>2b-c</sup>You could not take solid food. (CEV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>3:2d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:2d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>In fact, you are still not ready,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But even now, you are still not ready/able <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to receive/understand such food/teaching</span>.</p></li><li><p>But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what is bad is</span>, even after all this time, you still are not ready <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to learn about those things which are for mature believers.</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>In fact:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>In fact</em> emphasizes what Paul was saying. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>even now (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>even yet (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you are still not ready:</strong> Here Paul began to rebuke/criticize the believers. After being believers for a few years, they were still thinking and acting like babies. They were not yet mature enough in their faith to understand and benefit from the full teaching of the gospel.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>not ready:</strong> Here, the phrase <em>not ready</em> implies that the Corinthians were not ready for “solid food;” that is, for more difficult or in-depth teaching. In some languages it may be natural to supply this implied information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not ready for solid food</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not ready to eat solid food</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages you may be able to suggest something of the meaning of the metaphor by using words that can refer to either food or teaching. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>mature enough to absorb/digest anything more substantial</p></blockquote>",

Some English versions do not translate this word. You should translate the connection in a way that is natural in your language. You may wish to follow the CSB and say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because (CSB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you are still worldly:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>worldly</em> is almost the same as the word used in 3:1b. It literally means “fleshly”; that is, characterized by flesh. Here it probably refers to people who <u>want</u> to live as they please, obeying their own desires instead of obeying the Holy Spirit. The Corinthians were still willing to be controlled by their natural human impulses. Other ways to translate this verse part include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are still of the flesh (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are still influenced by the flesh (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you’re still influenced by your corrupt nature (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you still live as the people of this world live (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>3:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For since there is jealousy and dissension among you,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You are envious/jealous of one another, and you argue with each other.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I know that this is true about you</span> for you are jealous and quarrelsome.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>For</em> introduces a further step in Paul’s argument. It introduces the grounds for saying they are worldly. Some English versions such as the GNT do not explicitly translate this conjunction here. You may leave it implicit if that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>since there is jealousy and dissension among you:</strong> There are several ways of understanding the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>since</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>since</u> and introduces a logical reason: the Corinthians’ jealousy and quarreling proved that they were still worldly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>since there is jealousy and dissension among you (NET) <em>(NIV, KJV, NASB, NET, NLT, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>while</u> or <u>when</u> and refers to a time span. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As long as there are jealousy and rivalry among you (NJB) <em>(NJB, RSV, GNT, ESV, REB, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This verse part indicates how Paul knew that the Corinthian believers were still worldly. Some of them were acting jealously, and some of them argued among themselves.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>there is jealousy and dissension among you:</strong> In some languages it may be natural to translate the abstract nouns <em>jealousy</em> and <em>dissension</em> as adjectives or verbs.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is a textual problem here. (1) Some Greek manuscripts say “jealousy and quarreling.” These manuscripts are followed by the BSB, CEV, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, ESV, GW, NLT, and NCV. (2) Some other manuscripts say “jealousy and quarreling and strife.” The KJV follows these manuscripts. It is recommended that you follow option 1. This is supported by the UBS Greek NT, which gives it a B rating, indicating that the text is almost certain.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you are jealous/envious and contentious</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you envy one another and you quarrel with one another</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you are jealous of one other and quarrel with each other (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>3:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>are you not worldly?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Does this not mean/show that you are <span data-bnType=\"implied\">living/just</span> like the people of this world?</p></li><li><p>Does this not prove that you are influenced/controlled by your human/evil nature?</p></li><li><p>This/That shows that you are still obeying/following your own fleshly/natural desires.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>are you not worldly?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. Paul was rebuking the Corinthians. He was stating strongly that the Corinthians were worldly. They were not behaving as believers should. The Greek word translated <em>worldly</em> here is the same as in 3:3a. See the note there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are several ways to translate this rhetorical question:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>as a question with the answer implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>doesn’t this prove that you belong to this world…? (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This shows that you are still not spiritual. (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as an exclamation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>How worldly/fleshly you are!</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">You should translate this in a way that is natural in your language for showing a strong rebuke.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:3b-c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to indicate the logical connection between the verse parts at the beginning of 3:3c, as the NLT does:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>3b</sup>You are jealous of one another and quarrel with each other. <sup>3c</sup><u>Doesn’t that prove</u> that you are controlled by your sinful nature? (NLT)</p></blockquote></div><h4>3:3d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:3d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Are you not walking in the way of man?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Are you not behaving like people who do not know God?</p></li><li><p>You are acting no differently from the people of this world.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Are you not walking in the way of man?:</strong> This is a second rhetorical question. It emphasizes Paul’s rebuke. He was making a strong statement that the Corinthians were not acting like spiritual people. They were acting just like all human beings do in their natural state without the Holy Spirit. They were acting selfishly rather than for God’s glory. So there are at least three ways to translate this verse part:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>as a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>are you not…behaving like ordinary men? (RSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are acting like people of this world (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as an exclamation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You are acting just like ordinary people!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You should translate this in a way that is natural in your language for making a strong statement about what someone is doing wrong.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>walking:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>walking</em> is an idiom that refers to the way one lives and behaves in normal everyday life. The same word is used in Romans 6:4, 8:4, Galatians 5:16, and Ephesians 4:1. Refer to the notes on these passages. You may be able to use the same word or phrase here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in the way of man:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>in the way of man</em> is literally “according to man/human.” It does not refer only to males. Paul was saying that the Corinthians were behaving like unbelieving people. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>like people of this world (CEV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:3c-d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek these two questions form one sentence connected by a preposition meaning “and.” The RSV follows the Greek and says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>are you not of the flesh and behaving like ordinary men? (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">You may translate these questions as one sentence or as two sentences, whichever is more natural in your language.</p></div>",

Some English versions such as the GNT do not explicitly translate this conjunction.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>one of you says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,”:</strong> Paul again referred to what some people from Chloe’s household had reported to him. See 1:11–12 and the notes on 1:12b and 1:12c. It is recommended that you translate this sentence in a way that is similar to the way that you translated 1:12.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>one of you says</em> does not mean that <u>just one person</u> said this. Similarly, the phrase <em>and another</em> does not refer to just one person. Paul was talking about these people as representatives of two groups. And these two groups were just examples of some of the groups in the Corinthian church. In some languages it may be better to translate the phrases <em>one of you says</em> and <em>another</em> with plural forms. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Some of you say…and some others say….</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Consider whether it is natural in your language to translate what the Corinthians were saying as a direct quote, as the BSB does, or as indirect quotes as in this example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Some of you say that you follow me. Others say that you follow Apollos.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I follow Paul…I follow Apollos:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>I follow Paul</em> literally says “I am of Paul.” The speaker was saying that he belonged to a group that admired Paul and followed his teachings. Other people were saying that they looked to Apollos as their spiritual leader and teacher. Other ways to translate these clauses include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I belong to Paul…I belong to Apollos (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I am on Paul’s side…I am on Apollos’s side.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Paul is the teacher that I/we like…Apollos is the teacher that I/we like.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Paul:</strong> Paul was referring to himself. In some languages it may therefore be necessary to use the first-person pronoun “me” when using indirect speech:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>some of you say that you follow me</p></blockquote><h4>3:4c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:4c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>are you not mere men?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>are you not just like the rest of the world?</p></li><li><p>you are behaving like people who do not know God.</p></li><li><p>That behavior/talk of yours shows that you are no different from the people of this world.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>are you not mere men?:</strong> This is a third rhetorical question. It means approximately the same thing as “Are you not walking in the way of man?” in 3:3d. Paul used this question to emphasize what he was saying: the Corinthians were behaving like unbelievers. Again, there are at least two ways to translate this question:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>as a question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>isn’t this how ordinary people behave? (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are acting like people of the world (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ul>",

And what is Paul?:</strong> These are rhetorical questions. Paul used them to introduce a new topic that he wanted his readers to think about. He wanted them to think about the status of Apollos and Paul (that is, himself). He was not asking for information. So there are several ways to translate these questions:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>as rhetorical questions. For example,</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And besides that, who do you think Apollos and I are?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Why do you think that Apollos and I are so important?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Who is Apollos, and who is Paul, that we should be the cause of such quarrels? (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as questions with the answer supplied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Is Apollos important? No! Is Paul important? No! (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as statements. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Consider Apollos and me.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>What:</strong> There is a textual problem here.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some Greek texts say <u>what</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What is Apollos, really? Or what is Paul? (NET) <em>(BSB, NIV, REB, RSV, NJB, NET, ESV, NASB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Some Greek texts say <u>who</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>After all, who is Apollos? And who is Paul? (GNT) <em>(KJV, NLT, GNT, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1), as does the UBS Greek text. Some of the English versions that say “who” are almost certainly doing so for reasons of English style and naturalness.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>What</em> is a neuter form, usually used for speaking of things, objects, rather than people. It is a low-status word, indicating that Paul and Barnabas were instruments, not important for their own sake or in their own selves. In some languages it will not be possible to refer to men by a neuter pronoun. In that case, you should consider using an expression that makes it clear that the questions deal with how important the people are. For example, the NCV translated this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Is Apollos important? (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Or you could use a word or expression in your language that implies a low status person such as a servant.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>then:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>then</em> is usually translated as “therefore” or “so then.” In this context it introduces a further step in Paul’s argument concerning Christian workers.

Different ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Each of us performed the task which the Lord assigned to him.

It was because all Christian workers are working for God. He and Apollos were not important in themselves. They were just servants of God whom God sent to help the Corinthians to believe.</p></div><h4>3:6–9</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 3:6–9 Paul used a figure of speech called an extended metaphor. He talked about planting seeds, watering plants, and the way plants grow. However, he was actually referring to the way the church in Corinth started and grew.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">There are several ways to translate this extended figure of speech. In the following illustration, 3:6a is used as an example of how to translate the rest of the figure of speech:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>as a metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am the one who planted the seeds.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">The NLT makes it clearer that this is a metaphor by supplying the words “in your hearts”:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>My job was to plant the seed in your hearts. (NLT)</p></blockquote><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>as a simile, using a word meaning “like.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am <u>like</u> a person who planted the seeds.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My job is <u>like</u> the job of a person who planted the seeds.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a metaphor or simile, with the comparison explained. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I planted the seeds—<span data-bnType=\"implied\">meaning I began the work of teaching you God’s message</span>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was like a person who planted seeds, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because I was the one who began the work of teaching you God’s message</span>.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>without a figure of speech, translating only the meaning with no mention of planting or seed. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am the one who began the work of teaching you God’s message.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">It is best if you can use one of the first three methods to translate the metaphor in 3:6–9. But if people in your language group are confused by this metaphor and cannot understand what Paul means, you may have to translate all of 3:6–9 using the fourth method.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here is a sample translation of 3:6–9 that uses the fourth method:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6a</sup>I am the one who began the work of teaching you God’s message. <sup>6b</sup>Apollos continued this work. <sup>6c</sup>But it was God who caused you to have faith. <sup>7a</sup>So it is not the person who began the work or the person who continued the work that is important. <sup>7b</sup>God is the one who is important; he is the one who causes you to believe. <sup>8a</sup>The person who began the work among you and the person who continued the work, they/we<sup>(excl)</sup> are all just part of the team. <sup>8b</sup>God will give each of us<sup>(excl)</sup> a reward for the work we<sup>(excl)</sup> have done, <sup>9a</sup>because we<sup>(excl)</sup> are working as a team doing God’s work, not our<sup>(excl)</sup> own. <sup>9b</sup>You are God’s people, not ours<sup>(excl)</sup>. <sup>9c</sup>You are like a house that God is building for himself.</p></blockquote><h4>3:6a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:6a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I planted the seed</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I am the one who planted the seed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the good news in your hearts</span>.</p></li><li><p>I am like a person who plants seeds, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for I am the one who began telling the gospel in your city</span>.</p></li><li><p>I was the first one to tell you God’s message, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so I am like a person who plants seeds in the ground.</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I planted the seed:</strong> This is a metaphor. Paul was indicating that he was the one who first preached the gospel to the Corinthians. See the notes on 3:6–9 above for suggestions of different ways to translate this.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>I planted the seed</em> is literally <em>I planted</em>. In many languages it will be natural or even necessary to follow the BSB and say <u>what</u> was planted. The pronoun <em>I</em> is emphatic here, to make a contrast with “Apollos” in 3:6b and “God” in 3:6c.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>planted:</strong> In some languages there are different words for different kinds of planting. For example: planting by scattering seeds, planting by making a hole with a stick and dropping seeds in, planting with a shovel or other tool. Paul used a general word that can mean any kind of planting. So you can use whatever word will be the most easily understood in your language as a figure of speech.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the seed:</strong> The BSB has supplied this phrase. In this context it refers to many individual grains that are all of one kind/type. In some languages it may be natural to use a plural form:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the seeds</p></blockquote><h4>3:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and Apollos watered it,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Apollos is the one who watered the seed.</p></li><li><p>Apollos is like a person who watered the seed/sprouts, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for he continued the work of teaching you</span>.</p></li><li><p>After that, Apollos helped you to become stronger in your faith, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">just like another person waters the plants that have begun growing.</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Apollos watered it:</strong> This verse part continues the metaphor. Paul was saying that after he had himself preached the gospel in Corinth, Apollos helped the church by preaching and teaching.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek text that the BSB translates as <em>Apollos watered it</em> is literally <em>Apollos watered</em>. In many languages it may be necessary to say <u>what</u> he watered. You may be able to follow the BSB or you may need to say explicitly:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Apollos watered the seeds/seed.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Apollos watered the sprouts/plants.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If it is not a normal custom in your part of the world to water crops, you may need to translate the verb <em>watered</em> with a general word such as “tended” or “took care of”:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Apollos took care of the seedlings.</p></blockquote><h4>3:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but God made it grow.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But it was God who made the plants grow.</p></li><li><p>But God is the one who caused the seed to sprout, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that is, he is the one who gave you spiritual life</span>.</p></li><li><p>But it was God who gave you new life, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">just as he is the one who makes seeds grow into plants.</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but God made it grow:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>but</em> indicates contrast. Here in 3:6a-c, the strong contrast is not between Paul and Apollos. It is between both of them and <em>God</em>. Show this contrast in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>made it grow:</strong> The verb <em>made…grow</em> means to cause to become bigger, or to cause to increase. In the figure of speech Paul was referring to the way seeds sprout and grow into plants. The meaning of this figure of speech is this: Paul was the first one who came and preached the gospel to the Corinthians. Then Apollos came and helped them understand the gospel more. But God is the one who caused them to believe and grow in their faith, not Paul or Apollos.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:6a-c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek, the verbs in 3:6a and 3:6b (“planted,” “watered”) are in the simple past tense. But the verb in 3:6c (“made it grow”) is in the imperfect tense, indicating continuous action. The following translation helps explain the meaning of these tenses:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I <span data-bnType=\"implied\">at one time</span> planted the seeds. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">At another time</span> Apollos watered the plants. But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">during the whole time</span> God was causing the plants to grow.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Try to show this difference in the verbs in a way that is natural in your language.</p></div>",

The GNT does not translate this explicitly here. Consider how to introduce Paul’s conclusion in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything:</strong> This is a figure of speech called a hyperbole. Paul meant that he and Apollos were nothing in comparison to God. Their work was not the work that ultimately made the difference in the Corinthians’ lives. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is important (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The one who plants and the one who waters really do not matter. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>neither the planter nor the waterer counts for anything (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>he who plants…he who waters:</strong> Here Paul talked about himself as well as Apollos in the third person. He did this because he was teaching something that is true of all Christian workers. See the General Comment on 3:7–8 at the end of 3:8b for other ways to translate this.</p><h4>3:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but only God, who makes things grow.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>God is the important one, for he makes the plants grow.</p></li><li><p>No, God is the one who matters, for he is the one who causes/brings growth.</p></li><li><p>No, rather, God is the one who is really important, because he gives you new life and makes you grow spiritually.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but only God, who makes things grow:</strong> The phrase <em>but only God</em> is a short way of saying “but God is everything,” that is, only God is important/significant. The relative clause <em>who makes things grow</em> gives the basis for what Paul had just said, that God is the one who is truly important. God is the only one who can make seeds grow into plants, and God is the only one who can create new spiritual life in people’s hearts. He is the one who causes them to have faith and grow strong in faith.

Here it introduces a new point in the metaphor that Paul began in 3:6. The BSB and some other English versions do not explicitly translate it, but the KJV translates it as “Now.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He who plants and he who waters are one in purpose:</strong> A literal translation of the Greek is “the one planting and the one watering are one.” There are two ways to interpret this:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The workers have the same purpose. They work together as a team. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The one who plants and the one who waters have the same goal.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He who plants and he who waters are equal. (RSV) <em>(CEV, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The KJV, ESV, NASB, NJB, and GNT can be interpreted in either way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>There is no difference between the one who plants and the one who waters. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you try to maintain the ambiguity of the Greek. If you must choose between the interpretations, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), since it has stronger support from the commentaries.</p><h4>3:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and each will be rewarded according to his own labor.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Both will receive pay/wages in accordance with their work.</p></li><li><p>And <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will pay/reward each worker for the way each has done his work.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will give both/each <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of us</span><sup>(excl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">workers</span> a reward for what we<sup>(excl)</sup> do,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>each will be rewarded:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>each will be rewarded</em> is literally “each one will receive his own pay.” In the context of the metaphor, this means that the farm workers will receive the wages they have earned. But in the context of the figure of speech, this means that each Christian worker will receive a reward. God will reward each of his servants for doing his work well. In some languages it may be natural to make it explicit that it is God who will give the reward. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God will reward each one (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>according to his own labor:</strong> The phrase <em>according to his own labor</em> means “in proportion to the work he has done.” The pay or reward will be appropriate for the work that the worker has done. A worker who has worked well will receive a big reward. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for what they do (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to translate the words <em>according to his own labor</em> as an adjective describing the reward; that is, as a proper or appropriate reward. For example, it may be possible to translate 3:8b as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>each will receive appropriate compensation</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>each will have the proper pay for the work that he has done (NJB)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:7–8</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In these verses Paul referred to himself in the third person as “he who plants” (3:7a) and “the man who plants” (3:8a).

That was why they were dividing into separate groups and arguing with one another about teachers. They needed to learn about God’s plan for Christian workers and leaders. Christian workers and leaders all belong to God and are all building God’s church together.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other possible section headings include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul and all the other apostles were the Lord’s servants</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>All believers belong to the Lord and should remain united</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1047003005\" data-endVerseId=\"1047003009\"><h3>Paragraph 3:5–9</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul told why the Corinthians should not divide into groups and following their favorite Christian workers. It was because all Christian workers are working for God. He and Apollos were not important in themselves. They were just servants of God whom God sent to help the Corinthians to believe.</p></div><h4>3:9</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek text of 3:9, the word “God” is emphasized three times. The workers belong to <u>God</u>. The church in Corinth belongs to <u>God</u>, not to Paul or Apollos. The church is like a building which <u>God</u> is making for himself to live in. Paul was trying tried to help the Corinthians understand that God is the important one. It was foolish to divide into competing groups following different workers, for the workers were all serving God..</p><h4>3:9a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:9a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For we are God’s fellow workers;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Apollos and I work together for God (CEV)</p></li><li><p>For we<sup>(excl)</sup> are workers/servants who do together what God orders us<sup>(excl)</sup> to do.</p></li><li><p>for we<sup>(excl)</sup> are both workers who do his work.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>For</em> introduces the grounds for what Paul has been saying. It is a very general connection and it may not be necessary to translate this word explicitly.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we are God’s fellow workers:</strong> There are two ways of understanding the Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>we are God’s fellow workers</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It indicates that Paul and Apollos were working together for God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we are fellow workers in God’s service (REB) <em>(NRSV, NET, REB, NLT, NCV, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It indicates that Paul and Apollos were doing the same task as God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we are labourers together with God (KJV) <em>(BSB, KJV, NIV, NASB, RSV, ESV, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The NJB is ambiguous: “We do share in God’s work.” It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This fits better with the context of 3:7, where Paul and Apollos are said to be insignificant in comparison with God. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We are coworkers belonging to God. (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We are God’s workers, working together. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we are both God’s workers (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>3:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>you are God’s field,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believers in Corinth</span> are a field/plot/garden that belongs to God.</p></li><li><p>You are like the field that God has ordered us<sup>(excl)</sup> to work in.</p></li><li><p>God is the one you belong to, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">just like a field belongs to the owner</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you are God’s field:</strong> This is a metaphor. Paul compared the Corinthian church to a field that God owned. This is a reference to a field used for growing crops, a field in which people plant and water seeds. In some languages it may be natural to translate this as a simile:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are <u>like</u> a field that belongs to God</p></blockquote><h4>3:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>God’s building.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You are a house that belongs to God.</p></li><li><p>Also, I can compare you to a house/building that God is building.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Or think about yourselves in this way:</span> All of you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believers</span> are like a building which God is constructing/making.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God’s building:</strong> This is another metaphor. It is a short way of saying “you are also God’s building.” The phrase <em>God’s building</em> means “a house/building that belongs to God.” The Corinthian church as a whole was like a house that God was building for himself. God was causing this house to be built by using/ordering Paul and others to work for him. In some languages it may be natural to translate this as a simile:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are <u>like</u> a house belonging to God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In 3:6–9b, Paul used one metaphor: he talked about planting seeds and watering seeds and God making plants to grow. But here in 3:9c Paul changed to a new metaphor: he compared the Corinthian believers to God’s building. This metaphor continues through 3:15. In some languages it may be natural to introduce this new metaphor with a word meaning “or” (as the JBP does)</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>or God’s building</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions begin a new paragraph at 3:10. (See 3:10 in the BSB, NASB, RSV, ESV, CEV, NJB, NIV, NLT, and the NCV). But some versions begin a new paragraph at 3:9c. (See 3:9 in the REB and the GNT).</p>",

This is about constructing a building. Paul said that he was an expert builder who laid a foundation. This means that he started the church in Corinth. He was the one who first preached the gospel in Corinth and first taught the people there to believe in Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul said that other people were building on the foundation that he had laid. This means that other Christian workers were continuing the work in Corinth. They were teaching the believers. God will reward such workers if they do their work faithfully.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In these verses Paul talked about a building, housebuilders, the materials used to build the building, and about fire. It is best if you can keep this metaphor in your translation. But if the people who read your translation will not understand what Paul was saying, you may need to change how you translate it. There are several ways to translate these verses:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>literally, as a metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was the expert builder who laid the foundation.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was like an expert builder who laid a foundation.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>giving both the metaphor and the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I began God’s work among you. I was like an expert builder who laid the foundation.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>giving the meaning of the metaphor without the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I began God’s work among you.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">This metaphor is an important part of Paul’s teaching in 3:10–15. Because of this, it is best if you translate these verses using one of the first three methods above. You should remove the metaphor only if the people in your language group cannot understand the metaphor when it is translated in any of the first three ways. In the footnote is a sample translation of 3:10–15 that follows the third method.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Here is a sample translation of 3:10–16 that translates the extended metaphor as a simile and also gives the meaning:“(10a) God graciously gave me ability to do his work. So, using that ability, (10b) I began God’s work among you. I was like a wise house builder who begins building a house by laying the foundation. (10c) Now, other workers are continuing God’s work among you. they are like house builders who are building on top of the foundation that I already laid. (10d) But I warn each of those who are doing God’s work: Be careful what you do! (11) No one should teach any other way to be saved, except the way that God has given us. Jesus Christ is the only Savior that God has given us. He is like the foundation to the house.(12a) Some workers do God’s work well. They are like house builders who build on the foundation using good quality materials like gold, silver and valuable stones. (12b) Other workers do not do God’s work well. They are like house builders who build on the foundation using poor-quality materials like wood, hay and straw. (13a) In the future it will become clear what kind of work each worker has done, (13b) because when Jesus returns, he will make this all clear. (13c) When he returns he will judge what everyone has done. When he judges people, it will be like a fire. (13d) It will be like a person who tests different materials by putting them in a fire to see if they are good quality or not. (14a) When Jesus judges the works of some workers, he will say/declare that their works are good. Their works will be like good quality materials that do not burn up in the fire. (14b) He will reward those workers. (15a) But when he judges the works of other workers, he will declare/say that their work was not good. Their works will be like poor-quality materials that burn up in the fire. (15b) These workers will not get any reward. (15c) God will still save them from the punishment of their sins, (15d) but all of the work they have done will be of no value. They will be like a person who has run out of a burning house: he did not die but everything he had was burned up.”</span></span></p></div><h4>3:10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>By the grace God has given me,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Using the ability that God graciously gave to me,</p></li><li><p>¶ God was gracious to me and made me able to work for him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>By the grace God has given me:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>grace</em> here refers to a gift or special ability that God had given Paul. God had made Paul an apostle and had given him the ability to do the work of an apostle. In some languages it may be natural to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God has graciously enabled/allowed me</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Using the gift that God gave me (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>3:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I laid a foundation as an expert builder,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I did the work of an wise/skillful expert house builder by laying the foundation.</p></li><li><p>I was <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the first to preach the gospel among you,</span> like a skilled builder laying a foundation.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I laid a foundation:</strong> A <em>foundation</em> is a strong stone base on which a house is built. It is the part of a building that the worker makes first. It holds up the rest of the building or it holds it together in a firm way. In some cultures, people start making a house or building by setting posts deep into the ground, or by putting up a center pole. If in your area people do not understand what a <em>foundation</em> is, you may want to substitute another part of a house that has a similar function. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I planted the center pole</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I put together the main beams on which the house is</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I firmly set down the main rocks on which the house is</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The meaning of this metaphor is that Paul began the church in Corinth with the firm foundation of the gospel of Jesus Christ. He was the first one to proclaim the gospel in Corinth.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as an expert builder:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>builder</em> refers to someone who is experienced at building. The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>expert</em> means “skilled” or “wise.” It is the same word as in 1:19–20 and 1:25–27. In some languages it may be natural to put this information at the beginning of 3:10b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>like a skilled master-builder I laid a foundation (NET)</p></blockquote><h4>3:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and someone else is building on it.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Since that time,</span> other workers are <span data-bnType=\"implied\">continuing the work by</span> building on top of the foundation <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that I laid</span>.</p></li><li><p>Now <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other Christian workers are teaching you,</span> just like other builders put/build the rest of the building on top of the foundation.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>someone else is building on it:</strong> Paul was talking about other Christian workers in general who were continuing the work he began in Corinth. They were teaching and leading the believers there at that time.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>someone else:</strong> Paul used a singular form here, but he was probably not referring to only one person. If it is more natural in your language, you can translate this using a plural. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I laid a foundation on which others have built (3:10b-c, CEV).</p></blockquote><h4>3:10d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:10d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But each one must be careful how he builds.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But every worker must be careful how he builds.</p></li><li><p>But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">each worker must make sure that he teaches well/correctly,</span> just like builders must make sure that they build carefully/correctly on the foundation,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates here as <em>But</em> introduces a warning. The RSV does not explicitly translate this conjunction. You should introduce Paul’s warning in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>each one must be careful how he builds:</strong> This is a warning to the Christian workers in Corinth who were not doing God’s work well. Paul was probably talking about people in the Corinthian church who were causing the believers to argue about who was the best teacher. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Everyone should/must be careful how they build.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You workers, be careful how you each/all build.</p></blockquote>",

Paul laid the foundation among the Corinthians by telling them what God has done through Christ. The foundation is thus a metaphor for the message about Christ.</p></li><li><p>It was God who had laid the foundation. The foundation is the actual sending of Christ to die on the cross for our sins. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God has already placed Jesus Christ as the one and only foundation, and no other foundation can be laid.

He was the one who first preached the gospel in Corinth and first taught the people there to believe in Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul said that other people were building on the foundation that he had laid. This means that other Christian workers were continuing the work in Corinth. They were teaching the believers. God will reward such workers if they do their work faithfully.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In these verses Paul talked about a building, housebuilders, the materials used to build the building, and about fire. It is best if you can keep this metaphor in your translation. But if the people who read your translation will not understand what Paul was saying, you may need to change how you translate it. There are several ways to translate these verses:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>literally, as a metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was the expert builder who laid the foundation.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was like an expert builder who laid a foundation.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>giving both the metaphor and the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I began God’s work among you.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I began God’s work among you.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">This metaphor is an important part of Paul’s teaching in 3:10–15. Because of this, it is best if you translate these verses using one of the first three methods above. You should remove the metaphor only if the people in your language group cannot understand the metaphor when it is translated in any of the first three ways. In the footnote is a sample translation of 3:10–15 that follows the third method.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Here is a sample translation of 3:10–16 that translates the extended metaphor as a simile and also gives the meaning:“(10a) God graciously gave me ability to do his work. So, using that ability, (10b) I began God’s work among you. I was like a wise house builder who begins building a house by laying the foundation. (10c) Now, other workers are continuing God’s work among you. they are like house builders who are building on top of the foundation that I already laid. (10d) But I warn each of those who are doing God’s work: Be careful what you do! (11) No one should teach any other way to be saved, except the way that God has given us. Jesus Christ is the only Savior that God has given us. He is like the foundation to the house.(12a) Some workers do God’s work well. They are like house builders who build on the foundation using good quality materials like gold, silver and valuable stones. (12b) Other workers do not do God’s work well. They are like house builders who build on the foundation using poor-quality materials like wood, hay and straw. (13a) In the future it will become clear what kind of work each worker has done, (13b) because when Jesus returns, he will make this all clear. (13c) When he returns he will judge what everyone has done. When he judges people, it will be like a fire. (13d) It will be like a person who tests different materials by putting them in a fire to see if they are good quality or not. (14a) When Jesus judges the works of some workers, he will say/declare that their works are good. Their works will be like good quality materials that do not burn up in the fire. (14b) He will reward those workers. (15a) But when he judges the works of other workers, he will declare/say that their work was not good. Their works will be like poor-quality materials that burn up in the fire. (15b) These workers will not get any reward. (15c) God will still save them from the punishment of their sins, (15d) but all of the work they have done will be of no value. They will be like a person who has run out of a burning house: he did not die but everything he had was burned up.”</span></span></p></div><h4>3:12</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul wrote more about building an important house or building. In this verse he talked about the materials that the construction workers can decide to use. This is a metaphor. The building materials represent the quality of each Christian worker’s work, that is, whether his teaching was focused on Christ or not.</p><h4>3:12a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:12a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>If anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, precious stones,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Some workers use <span data-bnType=\"implied\">good material such as</span> gold, silver, or valuable stones, to build upon that foundation.</p></li><li><p>If Christian workers do their work well, they are like home/house builders who build on the foundation using <span data-bnType=\"implied\">high-quality materials such as</span> gold, silver, and valuable stones.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>gold, silver, precious stones:</strong> In the list of six materials, the first three are of lasting value and they will not burn.

Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>jewels (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If in your language there is no word for jewels, you may be able to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>beautiful/valuable rocks/stones</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>expensive decorations</p></blockquote><h4>3:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>wood, hay, or straw,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Other workers use <span data-bnType=\"implied\">poor material such as</span> wood, dried grass, or straw.</p></li><li><p>But if Christian workers do not do their work well, they are like home/house builders who use <span data-bnType=\"implied\">poor-quality materials such as</span> wood, hay, and straw.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>wood, hay, or straw:</strong> The last three materials that Paul lists are not valuable as building materials. They do not last as long, and they will burn if they catch fire.

If this is the case in your language, you should try to translate <em>wood</em> with a word or phrase that refers to cheap, thin wood that can burn easily.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>hay, or straw:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>hay</em> generally refers to grass. Here it probably refers to long dried grass. The word translated as <em>straw</em> refers to dried stalks of grain. In your translation, try to use words referring to cheap building materials that poor people can use to build temporary shelters.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:12a-b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be necessary to explain the meaning of this metaphor so that the readers will understand it. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In building on this foundation, some workers use <span data-bnType=\"implied\">valuable, long lasting</span> materials, such as gold, silver or valuable stones. Other workers build using materials <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that are not valuable or strong,</span> such as wood, dried grass, or straw. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">So, in a similar way, some of God’s workers faithfully teach God’s ways.

At the present time it is not always obvious whether the work that each person has done for God is good or not. When Christ returns and judges everything, it will become obvious.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are at least two ways to translate the clause <em>his workmanship will be evident</em>:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>each builder’s work will be plainly seen (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>their work will be clearly seen (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>using an active verb.

He will examine the way believers worked for him. In some languages it may be necessary to make it clear what <em>Day</em> Paul was referring to. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Day of Judgment will make it visible (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In many languages it is not natural to talk about a <em>Day</em> bringing something to light. Since the <em>Day</em> here means the time when Jesus return and judges people, you can make Jesus the subject of the sentence in your translation:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ Jesus</span> will make it visible on the Day <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when he returns/judges</span></p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:13a-b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">These two verse parts are talking about the same thing in different words. So in some languages it may be natural to combine them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>On the day/time <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when Christ judges all things</span>, he will expose the quality of every person’s work.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The day will make what each one does clearly visible.

It will be like putting it through fire.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek text 3:13c begins with a conjunction that is generally translated as “because.” 3:13c gives the reason why the Day will bring the quality of everyone’s work to light. The BSB does not explicitly translate this conjunction, but the RSV translates it as “because” and the GNT as “For.” You should connect 3:13c to 3:13b in the way that is most natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>It will be revealed with fire:</strong> There are two ways of interpreting this clause. The subject, <em>It</em>, could refer to:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><u>the day</u>, that is, the day Christ returns, judgment day. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>That day will appear with fire. (NCV) <em>(NJB, REB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p><u>each man’s work</u>, that is, the quality of what each worker did. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The day will make what each one does clearly visible because fire will reveal it. (GW) <em>(GNT, GW, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Several English versions translate literally and do not explicitly say to what <em>It</em> refers: BSB, KJV, RSV, NASB, ESV, NIV.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This is the interpretation recommended by the majority of commentators. The Greek word for <em>be revealed</em> usually means that in the future someone will come or an event will take place. It does not normally refer to something being made clear by testing it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>with fire:</strong> In both the OT and NT, <em>fire</em> is a common metaphor for judgment. For example, see 2 Thessalonians 1:7–8: “When the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire…he will punish…” Here also in 1 Corinthians 3:13 the <em>fire</em> probably refers to testing and judgment. In some languages it may be helpful to make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>with the fire <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of judgment</span></p></blockquote><h4>3:13d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:13d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and the fire will prove the quality of each man’s work.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The fire will test/show whether each worker has done good work.</p></li><li><p>Just as fire makes clear/apparent which building materials are good/strong/valuable, so Christ will declare whether or not each worker has worked well.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the fire will prove the quality of each man’s work:</strong> In this verse part Paul indicated that the fire would test how all the builders had done their work. It would check if they had used good materials. Here is another possible way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the fire will test everyone’s work to see what sort of work it was (NCV)</p></blockquote>",

These things will “survive.” So also, when Jesus judges the work a person has done and says that it is good, his work has “survived” the judgment.</p><h4>3:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>he will receive a reward.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>he/Christ will give a reward to that person/worker.</p></li><li><p>he/Christ will reward that worker.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he will receive a reward:</strong> See the note on 3:8b.

That was why they were dividing into separate groups and arguing with one another about teachers. They needed to learn about God’s plan for Christian workers and leaders. Christian workers and leaders all belong to God and are all building God’s church together.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other possible section headings include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul and all the other apostles were the Lord’s servants</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>All believers belong to the Lord and should remain united</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1047003010\" data-endVerseId=\"1047003015\"><h3>Paragraph 3:10–15</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph Paul used an extended metaphor. This is about constructing a building. Paul said that he was an expert builder who laid a foundation. This means that he started the church in Corinth. He was the one who first preached the gospel in Corinth and first taught the people there to believe in Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul said that other people were building on the foundation that he had laid. This means that other Christian workers were continuing the work in Corinth. They were teaching the believers. God will reward such workers if they do their work faithfully.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In these verses Paul talked about a building, housebuilders, the materials used to build the building, and about fire. It is best if you can keep this metaphor in your translation. But if the people who read your translation will not understand what Paul was saying, you may need to change how you translate it. There are several ways to translate these verses:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>literally, as a metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was the expert builder who laid the foundation.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was like an expert builder who laid a foundation.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>giving both the metaphor and the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I began God’s work among you. I was like an expert builder who laid the foundation.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>giving the meaning of the metaphor without the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I began God’s work among you.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">This metaphor is an important part of Paul’s teaching in 3:10–15. Because of this, it is best if you translate these verses using one of the first three methods above. You should remove the metaphor only if the people in your language group cannot understand the metaphor when it is translated in any of the first three ways. In the footnote is a sample translation of 3:10–15 that follows the third method.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Here is a sample translation of 3:10–16 that translates the extended metaphor as a simile and also gives the meaning:“(10a) God graciously gave me ability to do his work. So, using that ability, (10b) I began God’s work among you. I was like a wise house builder who begins building a house by laying the foundation. (10c) Now, other workers are continuing God’s work among you. they are like house builders who are building on top of the foundation that I already laid. (10d) But I warn each of those who are doing God’s work: Be careful what you do! (11) No one should teach any other way to be saved, except the way that God has given us. Jesus Christ is the only Savior that God has given us. He is like the foundation to the house.(12a) Some workers do God’s work well. They are like house builders who build on the foundation using good quality materials like gold, silver and valuable stones. (12b) Other workers do not do God’s work well. They are like house builders who build on the foundation using poor-quality materials like wood, hay and straw. (13a) In the future it will become clear what kind of work each worker has done, (13b) because when Jesus returns, he will make this all clear. (13c) When he returns he will judge what everyone has done. When he judges people, it will be like a fire. (13d) It will be like a person who tests different materials by putting them in a fire to see if they are good quality or not. (14a) When Jesus judges the works of some workers, he will say/declare that their works are good. Their works will be like good quality materials that do not burn up in the fire. (14b) He will reward those workers. (15a) But when he judges the works of other workers, he will declare/say that their work was not good. Their works will be like poor-quality materials that burn up in the fire. (15b) These workers will not get any reward. (15c) God will still save them from the punishment of their sins, (15d) but all of the work they have done will be of no value. They will be like a person who has run out of a burning house: he did not die but everything he had was burned up.”</span></span></p></div><h4>3:15a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:15a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>If it is burned up,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But if his work is burned up,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">But</span> if/when Christ says/declares that what a certain worker has done is not good,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>If it is burned up:</strong> Fire is a metaphor for judgment as a testing time (see the note on 3:13c). The picture of work being <em>burned up</em> illustrates a situation in which Christ declares that a worker has not done his work faithfully. His work did not help the church as God meant it to. Just as a fire burns up poor-quality materials like wood or straw, so when Christ judges these people, he will show that the work they have done is of no value.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The verb <em>is burned up</em> is in the passive. There are at least two ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if it is destroyed by the fire (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The one whose work is burned down… (NJB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>using an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If the fire destroys/consumes someone’s work</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use the verb form that is most natural in your language in this context.</p><h4>3:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>he will suffer loss.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>that worker will get nothing.</p></li><li><p>he/Christ will not reward that worker/person.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he will suffer loss:</strong> The clause <em>he will suffer loss</em> here means “the builder/worker will lose his reward,” that is, “the builder/worker will not receive his reward.” This verse part continues the metaphor. Its literal meaning is that a worker will lose (that is, not receive) what his boss had planned to give him as his pay. This figure of speech means that Christ will withhold some blessings or benefits which otherwise he would have given to his worker. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the builder will suffer great loss (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he will lose that reward</p></blockquote><h4>3:15c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:15c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He himself will be saved,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He himself, however, will be saved,</p></li><li><p>Yet <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will save him personally.</p></li><li><p>He will receive salvation,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek text 3:15c connects to 3:15b with a conjunction that the GNT translates as “but.” The BSB does not translate this conjunction. Here the conjunction indicates contrast: what happens to the worker is different from what happens to his work. The RSV translates this conjunction as “though.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\">You should indicate this contrast in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He himself will be saved:</strong> This clause literally indicates that the builder will not die, that is, perish in the fire that consumed his work. The metaphor indicates that a Christian worker will not fail to receive salvation even if he has not worked well. This is a passive clause. There are two ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the builder will be saved</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he himself will not lose his life</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They/God</span> will save the worker himself</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>himself:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>himself</em> here probably has a intensive meaning. It emphasizes the contrast between what happens to work done by the worker versus what happens to the worker himself.</p><h4>3:15d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:15d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but only as if through the flames.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but only like somebody escapes though fire/flames.</p></li><li><p>But he will be like a person who has to be saved from a fire.</p></li><li><p>but only in the way a person is rescued from a burning building.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but only as if through the flames:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek expression that the BSB translates as <em>through the flames</em>.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>through flames</u> or <u>through fire</u>. The person must escape by passing through fire, or like someone passing through fire. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>though it will be like going through a fire (GW) <em>(BSB, NIV, REB, GW, NLT, NASB, RSV, ESV, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>from flames</u> or <u>from fire</u>. The person escapes the fire and does not necessarily have to pass through it. For example, the NJB says;</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as someone might expect to be saved from a fire <em>(NJB, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The KJV has “by fire,” which could mean either. If you must choose between the interpretations, it is recommended that you choose interpretation (1). The person is indeed saved from the fire, but he has to go through the flames, like a worker who is rescued from his burning building. This figure of speech shows how serious it is if a worker for God does not faithfully carry out his task. Paul was emphasizing how important it is for a worker to build well. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>though only by passing through the fire (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but like someone barely escaping through a wall of flames (NLT)</p></blockquote>",

Paul warned that God will severely punish such false workers.</p></div><h4>3:16a-b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Do you not know…?:</strong> This introduces a rhetorical question. Paul used this rhetorical question to rebuke the Corinthian believers. He meant “Surely you know this,” or “You should know that this is true.” Paul was reminding the Corinthians of something that they should already have known. They were acting as though they did not know it. So there are at least two ways of translating this question:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>as a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do you not know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit lives in you? (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a statement.

He explained that the <u>kind</u> of building that God had sent him to build was God’s <em>temple</em> in Corinth. A <em>temple</em> is a sacred building where God or gods are believed to be present in a special way. But the <em>temple</em> Paul was referring to here was not a building people could look at. Instead, <em>God’s temple</em> was his people. God was present in and among his people. In some languages it may be more natural to translate this as a simile:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you yourselves are <u>like</u> a temple of/for God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>God’s temple:</strong> The phrase <em>God’s temple</em> here indicates a sacred building or location where God is present in a special way.

It explains in what way the believers in Corinth could be called “God’s temple” (3:16a). It may be natural to make this relationship clear by following one of these models:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are a temple of God <u>with</u> the Spirit of God living in you (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are God’s temple, <u>where</u> the Spirit of God dwells (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God’s Spirit dwells in you:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>you</em> is plural. The word <em>you</em><sup>(plur)</sup> included all of the believers in Corinth. Paul said that the Holy Spirit was in <u>the church as a whole</u>. The entire congregation of believers in Corinth was like a temple. So it is also possible to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s Spirit dwells <u>among</u> you<sup>(plur)</sup></p></blockquote>",

First, no one should follow the wisdom of this world. Second, no one should boast about following one teacher or another. This could cause divisions in the church. God in his wisdom sent Christ to be the only leader of his people. All the teachers should agree with Christ in their teaching.</p></div><h4>3:18a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:18a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Let no one deceive himself.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ I do not want anyone to keep deceiving himself.</p></li><li><p>¶ Stop deluding yourselves.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Let no one deceive himself:</strong> The Greek expression that the BSB translates as <em>Let no one deceive himself</em> is a command in the singular third person, addressed to each believer as an individual. You may use whichever person is more natural in your language. For example, you may translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>using the second-person singular:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You should not fool yourself. (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>using the second-person plural:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not deceive yourselves. (NIV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>using the third-person singular:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Let no one deceive himself. (BSB)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Apparently some believers in Corinth thought that they were wiser than other believers because of the teacher that they followed (see the notes on 1:12b, 1:12c, and 1:12d). They were mistaken in thinking this, and Paul was rebuking them for allowing themselves to think wrongly about this. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Guard against self-deception, each of you. (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Do not fool yourselves. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Make no mistake about this. (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>deceive himself:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>deceive</em> suggests that some people were thinking incorrectly about teachers, and Paul wanted them to stop. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>stop deceiving himself/themselves</p></blockquote><h4>3:18b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:18b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>If any of you thinks he is wise in this age,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Any of you who considers himself to be wise according to the standards/opinion of this age/world</p></li><li><p>Some of you consider yourselves to be wise, in the way that people of this world think about wisdom.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>If any of you thinks he is wise in this age:</strong> Paul was talking to some people in the church at Corinth who thought they were wise. They were using human wisdom to decide which teacher was best and then had pride in the teacher they followed.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>wise in this age:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>wise in this age</em> refers to what is considered <em>wise</em> by the standards of <em>this age</em>. Evidently some of the Corinthian believers were deciding who was the best teacher by using the same standards that unbelievers used to judge their teachers. This would include deciding whether they spoke persuasively and argued cleverly and used clever ideas. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>what this world considers wise</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>this age:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>this age</em> refers to this time we live in before Christ returns. See how you translated this phrase in 1:20c.</p><h4>3:18c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:18c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>he should become a fool,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>must become one who is thought foolish.</p></li><li><p>You must be willing to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">stop thinking like this and</span> let others/unbelievers consider you to be foolish</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he should become a fool:</strong> The clause <em>he should become a fool</em> indicates that these proud believers should give up their worldly wisdom. They should stop trying to be wise in the way that people of the world admire. Instead they should become fools according to the world’s standard by accepting what God considers wise (see 1:18a).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate this verse part include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he must make himself foolish in the opinion of others</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>let him discard his cleverness (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he should do what the world considers foolish <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and accept God’s wisdom</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>fool:</strong> In this context the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>fool</em> means someone who is not very smart rather than someone who is a mad or crazy person.</p><h4>3:18d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:18d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that he may become wise.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>In that way you may become wise <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in God’s opinion</span>.</p></li><li><p>so that God can make you truly wise.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that he may become wise:</strong> This is a purpose clause. When a person stops judging by this world’s standard and starts living by God’s standards, then he becomes a fool in the eyes of the world and wise in the eyes of God. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that you may know/receive true wisdom</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that he may become truly wise (JBP)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:18a-d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The Greek uses singular forms throughout this verse. Paul was not talking about any one individual. So in some languages it may be natural to use plural forms throughout. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>18a</sup>Do not deceive yourselves. <sup>18b</sup>Those of who you think you are clever in the ways of this world <sup>18c</sup>must be willing to be thought fools <sup>18d</sup>in order to become wise.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>18a</sup>Do not deceive yourselves. <sup>18b</sup>If you<sup>(plur)</sup> think you are wise in the ways of this world, <sup>18c</sup>you must get rid of your cleverness <sup>18d</sup>in order to become truly wise.</p></blockquote></div>",

They have different standards and values. What the world considers wisdom, God considers foolishness. See how you translated <em>foolishness</em> in 1:18a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to translate one or both of the abstract nouns <em>wisdom</em> and <em>foolishness</em> with adjectives. For example, the CEV translated <em>wisdom</em> as a noun but changed <em>foolishness</em> to an adjective:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God considers the wisdom of this world to be foolish. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Or you could translate both nouns as adjectives. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God thinks foolish the things that this world considers wise.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God thinks that the things this world considers to be wise are, in fact, foolish.</p></blockquote><h4>3:19b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:19b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>As it is written:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>This is like the words written <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the Scriptures</span>:</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We know that is true</span> because it agrees with what <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> Book says.

These quotations show that what this world’s people think is wise is actually not wise at all in the way God thinks about things. See the notes on <em>it is written</em> in 1:19a.</p><h4>3:19c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:19c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“He catches the wise in their craftiness.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“He traps the wise in their own cunning.” (REB)</p></li><li><p>“Some people think they are wise, but <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> uses their own clever thoughts/plans to defeat them.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He catches the wise in their craftiness:</strong> This is a quotation from Job 5:13. One of Job’s friends was speaking. The pronoun <em>He</em> refers to God. This is a metaphor taken from hunting and trapping animals. A hunter knows about the crafty ways of the animal he wants to catch, and he uses that knowledge to trap it. In a similar way, God can use a person’s most clever arguments to show that person that he is wrong.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>catches:</strong> The verb <em>catches</em> here is a figure of speech. It means that God defeats these people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the BSB, as in the Greek, the words “wise” and “craftiness” are not part of the metaphor. They have their literal meaning and help the reader to understand the metaphor.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate this verse part include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God uses the cleverness of wise people as a trap to catch them.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you should not brag about human leaders (NCV) <em>(NCV, NRSV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means that the Corinthians were not to boast about what people could do.

A possible model for a literal translation is the REB:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>never make any human being a cause for boasting (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you must choose between the interpretations, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Paul was probably referring back to what he wrote in 1:12. Some Corinthian believers were boasting that they followed Paul or Apollos. Here in 3:21a, Paul commanded them to not boast about who their leaders were. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>do not boast about being the follower/disciple of any human being</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>stop bragging about which human leader you follow</p></blockquote><h4>3:21b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:21b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>All things are yours,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>All things belong to you,</p></li><li><p>because already you have everything.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek text 3:21b is connected to 3:21a with a conjunction. In this context it introduces the basis for Paul’s command in 3:21a. In other words, 3:21b gives the reason believers should not proudly say they follow one teacher and not another. The BSB has not explicitly translated this conjunction, but the RSV translates it as “for.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\">You should introduce this verse part in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>All things are yours:</strong> The expression <em>All things are yours</em> can also be translated as “All things belong to you.” All things belong to believers because they belong to Christ and have everything in him. Paul was arguing that it was foolish to argue over which teacher was the best because God <u>had already given</u> the Corinthians everything by joining them together with Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">3:21b is a general statement, and Paul followed it by listing eight specific things that are ours in Christ. The first three are people; the last five are things. In your language you may need to separate the people from the things.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For a good explanation of what Paul talks about in 3:21–23, see Gordon D.

Because the Corinthian Christians were in Christ, Paul and Apollos and Cephas belonged to them. These leaders “belonged” to the Corinthians in the sense that God’s purpose in giving them these leaders was that the leaders would serve the Corinthians and help them become strong in faith. In some languages it may not be possible to say that these leaders “belonged” to the Corinthians. This might convey the wrong meaning that they were slaves. So it may be necessary to say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul and Apollos and Cephas, all serve you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul and Apollos and Cephas live/work for your sake/good</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God has given/sent you</span> Paul and Apollos and Cephas to help you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may not be natural for Paul to mention himself first.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Think of us in this way, as servants of Christ… (NRSV) <em>(KJV, RSV, NASB, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers back and introduces a conclusion to what Paul had just said. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So look at Apollos and me as mere servants of Christ (NLT) <em>(BSB, NIV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Many English versions do not explicitly translate this conjunction. In English this would be a natural way of translating interpretation (1) rather than interpretation (2). It is therefore recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>men ought to regard us as servants of Christ:</strong> This verse part indicates the way in which believers should view or think about Christian workers. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>People should think of us as servants of Christ (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>People should consider us to be Christ’s servants.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This functions as a command to the Corinthians to regard Christian workers as servants of Christ. In some languages it may be natural to translate this command using the second person (“you”). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You<sup>(plur)</sup> should regard us as Christ’s servants.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Think of us as servants of Christ. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>us:</strong> The pronoun <em>us</em> here refers to Paul and his fellow workers.

The phrase <em>servants of Christ</em> refers to people who work for Christ. They belong to him and serve him. The Greek word for <em>servants</em> is different from the one in 3:5, but the meaning is similar. You may translate this using the same word or expression as you used in 3:5.</p><h4>4:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and stewards of the mysteries of God.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and God has made us<sup>(excl)</sup> guardians/trustees of the things/matters that previously he did not make known to anyone.</p></li><li><p>God has sent us<sup>(excl)</sup> to tell people his plans/teachings that he has never told anyone before.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>stewards of the mysteries of God:</strong> This phrase indicates that Paul and his fellow workers had been given responsibility for God’s hidden truths. Their job was to proclaim and teach these truths correctly. In many languages it may be necessary to make this explicit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>stewards entrusted with <span data-bnType=\"implied\">proclaiming/declaring</span> the mysteries of God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>stewards:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>stewards</em> is more literally “household-managers, administrators.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Greek word <em>oikonomoi</em> means “stewards, house-managers, administrators.” In Bible times a rich man with many servants and much land usually had one special servant who was called a steward. He was the one in charge of the household and fields. His job was to oversee the other servants as they did the work. By using that word here, Paul meant that Christ had made him and his fellow workers responsible for telling God’s people all about the good things God had prepared for them and for teaching God’s people to follow his ways.</span></span> This is a metaphor. Paul was indicating that he and his fellow workers were like managers of someone’s important possessions. Christ had given them an important work to do for God and they were responsible to him for doing it faithfully.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are several ways of translating this metaphor:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>keep the metaphor and use a word referring to someone who manages or organizes another person’s goods or wealth. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we<sup>(excl)</sup> are managers/trustees</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we<sup>(excl)</sup> are like administrators/stewards</p></blockquote></li><li><p>explain the meaning of the metaphor. Some possible ways to explain the metaphor include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we<sup>(excl)</sup> have been given the responsibility/duty</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has put us<sup>(excl)</sup> in charge of</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the mysteries of God:</strong> For the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>mysteries</em>, see the notes on 2:1c and 2:7a. The <em>mysteries of God</em> are the truths that God did not reveal clearly to anyone in the past, but that he has now revealed to all believers. God had not told anyone these mysteries until Christ came to earth, and now he has sent the apostles to tell everyone. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s secret truths (GNT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:1a-b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek text these verse parts are connected with a conjunction, which the BSB translates literally as “and.” This conjunction here introduces a further explanation of what Paul had said about himself and other Christian workers. They were servants in the sense that they were stewards of God’s mysteries. It was their task or duty to preach God’s secret truths. There are several other ways to translate this connection:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>use a relative pronoun such as “who”:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Think of us as servants of Christ who have been given the work of explaining God’s mysterious ways (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You should think of us as Christ’s servants, who have been put in charge of God’s secret truths. (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>omit the conjunction and use a comma:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>People should think of us as Christ’s servants, stewards entrusted with the mysteries of God. (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>People should think of us as servants of Christ, the ones God has trusted with his secrets. (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>start a new sentence:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You should consider us Christian workers to be merely people who serve Christ. God has given us the responsibility/duty of proclaiming truths he has not previously revealed.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">Connect 4:1a and b in whichever way is natural in your language.</p></div>",

Some of the Corinthian believers were judging Paul in the sense that they were saying that he was not a good teacher. They were criticizing the way he had been working for the Lord.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>by any human court:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>human court</em> is literally “human day.” The word “day” refers to a day of judgment. Paul was probably referring not only to official courts of law but to any human evaluation or criticism. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>by any human judgment (GNT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:3a-b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to translate 4:3a-b as two separate sentences, repeating the information from 4:3a in both sentences. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But it is not important to me whether you think I have done my work well or not. It is not important to me what any human being thinks of my work.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>How you judge me is of little significance to me.

The NIV translates it as “indeed.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I do not even judge myself:</strong> This verse part indicates that Paul himself did not try to evaluate whether he had worked well or not. He knew that what he thought was not important.</p>",

His clear conscience was not enough to prove that he had acted in a way that pleased the Lord.

It refers to things that a person has thought or done secretly, things that other people do not know about. Other ways to translate this part of the verse include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will bring our deepest secrets to light (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he will bring into the light of day all that at present is hidden in darkness (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will show what is hidden in the dark (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>what is hidden in darkness:</strong> This is a passive phrase. It literally refers to things that cannot be seen because of darkness and figuratively refers to what is not known by other people. There are several ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>what is concealed by/in the dark</p></blockquote></li><li><p>using an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>what darkness hides (REB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>remove the metaphor of darkness.

He will make plain everyone’s inward thoughts and purposes. In your translation, you should refer to the part of the body where people think and plan (for example, the mind). Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will show…what is in everyone’s hearts. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>reveal people’s motives (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul did not say to whom the Lord would expose or reveal these things, whether to the people themselves or to others. He was probably thinking of people in general, rather than just the people themselves. So if you must make this explicit, you may be able to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will make clear <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to all people</span> what is in everyone’s heart</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:5d-e</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul said that the Lord will do two things that are closely related (he will “bring to light what is hidden in darkness” and he will “expose the motives of each man’s heart.”) The action in the first clause is described in a figurative and general way. The clause refers to exposing anything that is now hidden. The second clause is more specific. The Lord will expose people’s motives. There are several possible ways of translating these verse parts:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>use a conjunction that is broad or general in meaning, like the English “and.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will bring to light things that are now hidden in darkness, and will make known the secret purposes of people’s hearts.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness. He will reveal the motives of each one’s heart.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>indicate that the two clauses are closely related by using only one main (independent) verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness, disclosing everyone’s internal/inward motives.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will show what is hidden in the darkness and what is in everyone’s heart.

Since all their abilities came from God, they had no reason to talk proudly about them. Paul talked about Apollos and himself to contrast the suffering that true workers of Christ were enduring with the proud, boastful attitudes of the Corinthians.</p></div><h4>4:6a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:6a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Brothers, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ My brothers and sisters, I have been talking/writing about Apollos and myself in order to help you understand these things.</p></li><li><p>¶ My Christian friends, I have used Apollos and myself as illustrations in order to teach you something.</p></li><li><p>¶ Well now, my friends, I have illustrated these things for you by referring to Apollos and myself.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek this verse part connects to the previous verse part with a conjunction that is often translated as “but.” Here this word introduces a new idea. Many English versions, including the RSV and GNT, do not translate this conjunction explicitly. Some English versions translate the Greek word as “now” (see the NIV) or “and” (see the KJV). Introduce this new idea in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Brothers:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Brothers</em> refers to the Corinthian believers in general.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I have applied these things to myself and Apollos:</strong> By <em>these things</em>, Paul was probably talking about what he had said in chapter 3. He had used himself and Apollos as examples or illustrations of what he had been saying about Christian workers. He had mentioned himself and Apollos in 3:4–5 and had talked about himself and Apollos in his metaphors about planting (3:6–9b) and building (3:9c-15). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have used Apollos and myself to illustrate what I’ve been saying (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for your benefit:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>for your benefit</em> is literally “for you.” Here it means “for your good” or “to help you understand.” Paul used himself and Apollos as examples or illustrations to help the Corinthians understand what he was saying. In some languages it may be natural to translate this phrase at the beginning of the sentence, as the GNT has done:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For your sake, my friends, I have applied all this to Apollos and me…. (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>4:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that you may learn from us</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Through us<sup>(dual/excl)</sup> I want you to understand this saying/principle/maxim:</p></li><li><p>I want you to think about us so that you will understand these words:</p></li><li><p>I am using <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the two of</span> us<sup>(excl)</sup> as examples so that you will learn what this means:</p></li></ul></div><h4>4:6b-c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that you may learn from us not to go beyond what is written:</strong> The Greek of 4:6b-c is literally “so that from us you may learn the not beyond what is written.” Ancient Greek writing did not use quotation marks to indicate quoted material. So it is not always clear what words are quotations. Because of that, there are two ways to understand these verse parts:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>4:6c is a quotation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>4b</sup>so that you may learn what the saying means, <sup>4c</sup>“Observe the proper rules.” (GNT) <em>(NIV, GNT, NJB, CEV, NET, NCV, NRSV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Paul was himself encouraging the Corinthians to obey what was written. For example, the GW has translated this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>4b</sup>You should learn from us <sup>4c</sup>not to go beyond what is written in Scripture. (GW) <em>(BSB, RSV, GW, NASB, ESV, KJV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This interpretation has strong support from English versions and commentaries. Other ways to translate it are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that through us you may learn “not to go beyond what is written” (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that you can learn how the saying “Nothing beyond what is written” is true of us (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to teach you what this means: “Follow what is written.”</p></blockquote><h4>4:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>not to go beyond what is written.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You should not do or say anything beyond what someone wrote <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in God’s Book</span>.</p></li><li><p>“Go by the book.”</p></li><li><p>“Follow/Obey the teachings exactly as they are written <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the Scriptures</span>.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not to go beyond what is written:</strong> The Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>not to go beyond what is written</em> are literally “not beyond what is written.” If you choose to treat this as a quoted saying, then it may be natural to translate it as a command. This command may be positive or negative:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Follow only what is written in the Scriptures (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You should not say or do anything other than what is written <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the Scriptures</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages there may be a saying or idiom that is appropriate in this context. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Follow the rules. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Go by the book!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Stick/Keep to the written word!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>not to go beyond:</strong> This is a metaphor. Not obeying rules is like stepping over a boundary line. It is like going outside the place where one is supposed to be. Consider if there is a metaphor or idiom to express this in your language. Other ways to translate it in English include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>do not do anything apart from….</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>do only….</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>keep within….</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>follow….</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>what is written:</strong> Paul was probably referring to the instructions or commands that are written in the OT Scriptures. He meant that the written word should be followed and that it has authority. You may be able to suggest this authority in your language. One way to do this in English is to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>what stands written</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In your translation you may also need to add the implied information that the writing is about judging people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>what the book says <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about judging others</span>.</p></blockquote><h4>4:6d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:6d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Then you will not take pride in one man over another.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I have done this</span> so that you will not be proud, saying that the teacher you follow is better than another teacher.</p></li><li><p>My desire is that you will learn not to take sides and boast about one teacher/leader and criticize other teachers/leaders.</p></li><li><p>For I do not want you to proudly think/say that the teacher/leader you follow is better than another teacher/leader.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Then:</strong> There are several ways to understand the function of the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Then</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It introduces a purpose. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that none of you will be puffed up in favor of one against the other (NET) <em>(NASB, RSV, REB, CEV, NET, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It introduces a result. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then you won’t arrogantly place one of us in opposition to the other. (GW) <em>(BSB, NIV, NCV, GW, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It introduces an explanation of the meaning of the saying. For example, the NJB translates 4:6b-d as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that you can learn how the saying “nothing beyond what is written” is true of us: no individual among you must become filled with his own importance… (NJB) <em>(KJV, GNT, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">In this context, interpretations (1) and (2) are not very different from one another. Paul’s <u>purpose</u> in teaching was that the Corinthians would learn the meaning of the saying, and he expected the <u>result</u> of this would be that they would not take pride in their teachers. It is recommended that you translate in such a way that the conjunction introduces either purpose or expected result. If you must choose between the two interpretations, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), which is the normal meaning of the conjunction.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>take pride in one man over another:</strong> The Greek word for <em>take pride in</em> literally means “to be puffed up, to be full of hot air.” In this context it is a metaphor. Paul was referring to people who were proud because of the teacher they followed. In some languages there is an idiom that describes a person who is “puffed up.” Other ways to translate it in English include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>be more proud of one person than another (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>inflated with pride as you take sides in support of one against another (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>one man over another:</strong> Paul was referring to the way the Corinthians were taking sides and arguing over what teacher or leader was the best. See 1:12b, 1:12c, 1:12d, and 3:4a-b. It may be necessary to make this clear by translating <em>man</em> as “teacher” or “leaders”:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>one of your teachers more than another</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>one of your leaders at the expense of another (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to translate this verse part with a direct quote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>My purpose is that none of you will speak boastfully in this way: “I follow so-and-so, but you only follow so-and-so.”</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I do not want you to be proud and say, “I am following the best teacher. That teacher of yours is not as good.”</p></blockquote>",

He said that Christian leaders are servants of Christ and should be judged only by Christ. Some Corinthian believers were saying that they did not have to listen to Paul’s teaching. Paul encouraged the Corinthians to respect and obey him as their spiritual father.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other possible section headings include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul encouraged the Corinthians to respect him and Apollos</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul and Apollos deserved respect as Christ’s servants</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1047004006\" data-endVerseId=\"1047004013\"><h3>Paragraph 4:6–13</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph Paul rebuked the Corinthians for talking proudly about their abilities. Since all their abilities came from God, they had no reason to talk proudly about them. Paul talked about Apollos and himself to contrast the suffering that true workers of Christ were enduring with the proud, boastful attitudes of the Corinthians.</p></div><h4>4:7</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In this verse Paul used three rhetorical questions to rebuke the Corinthians for the way they argued over teachers and talked proudly about themselves.. He wanted them to feel ashamed of themselves for talking proudly about one teacher and showing dishonor toward another. So there are two ways to translate these questions:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>As rhetorical questions. In some languages it is common to use questions like this to criticize or show anger. But make sure that people who read your translation understand these questions as rebukes, not as real questions. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My friend, who makes you so important? What do you possess that was not given you? And if you received it as a gift, why take the credit to yourself? (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Who says you are better than others? What do you have that was not given to you? And if it was given to you, why do you brag as if you did not receive it as a gift? (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As emphatic statements that by implication rebuke or criticize the Corinthians. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You should not think that you are superior to others. All that you have was given to you. So there is no need to brag about it.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">In all three of these questions, Paul used the singular pronoun for “you.” It is as though he were talking to only one person. But he was actually addressing anyone in the group who thought that he or she had the right to look at the work of the teachers and judge them (4:3). In many languages it may therefore be best to translate this verse using the plural “you.”</p><h4>4:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For who makes you so superior?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For has anyone made you better than anyone else?</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">None of you should say that,</span> since no one made you more important than any other <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believer</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">None of you should judge/criticize your teachers/leaders,</span> for no one has given you a higher status <span data-bnType=\"implied\">than other believers</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>For</em> introduces a rhetorical question that indicates the basis for Paul’s statement; that is, the reason why the Corinthians should not be proud or puffed up. Some English versions, such as the GNT, do not explicitly translate this conjunction. You should introduce the following question in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who makes you so superior?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. In Greek it is literally, “who judges you<sup>(sing)</sup> to be superior?” The implied answer is “no one.” Paul was saying that anyone who was claiming to be superior and to have the right to judge Paul or another worker was wrong. No one had given him that right.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul used this rhetorical question to make an emphatic negative statement: no one had made the Corinthians superior to other believers. This statement implied a rebuke: the Corinthians should stop thinking and acting as though they were superior. There are therefore several ways to translate this verse part:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>as a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Who made you superior to others? (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Who says you are better than others? (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Who made you so important? (NJB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a question with the answer supplied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Did someone/God declare you to be above everyone else? No!</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as an emphatic statement or exclamation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No one has made you superior to others!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You are wrong to think you are better than others.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Consider what is the most natural way to translate this as a rebuke in your language.</p><h4>4:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>What do you have that you did not receive?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Do you have anything that you did not receive <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as a gift from God</span>? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Nothing.</span></p></li><li><p>You do not have anything except what <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has given you.</p></li><li><p>Everything you have is a gift <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from God</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>What do you have that you did not receive?:</strong> This verse part has some implied information. The Corinthians had received everything <u>from God</u>. God gave the Corinthians their salvation, all their material possessions, and all the abilities they had. So it is also possible to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What do you have that God hasn’t given you? (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Didn’t God give you everything you have? (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a rhetorical question. Paul used this question to make a strong negative statement. He meant “You have nothing that you did not receive.” In other words, “everything you have comes from God.” This implied a rebuke: the Corinthians should not act and speak proudly, because they were totally dependent on God. So there are several ways to translate this question:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>as a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What do you have that was not given to you? (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a question with the answer supplied. For example;</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do you have anything that was not given <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by God</span>? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">No!</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a strong statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Everything you have, you have received <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from God</span>.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a rebuke. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You should remember that God gave you every good thing you have.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this question in whichever way is natural in your language.</p><h4>4:7c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:7c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And if you did receive it,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Thus, since <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> gave you everything you have,</p></li><li><p>So then, if you agree with me that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> gave you everything you have,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>And</em> here introduces a third rhetorical question that functions as a concluding rebuke.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if you did receive it:</strong> Paul was implying that this condition was true. The Corinthians had received everything from God. This verse part gives the basis for the verse part that follows. So in this context the word <em>if</em> can be translated as “since”:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>since you did receive it</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:7b-c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">If you translate 4:7b as a strong statement, it may be unnatural to repeat the same information in 4:7c. Instead you may be need to abbreviate this verse part. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7b</sup>Everything you have was given to you. <sup>7c</sup>And so…</p></blockquote></div><h4>4:7d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:7d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>why do you boast as though you did not?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>then it is not proper/right for you to talk proudly about yourself, as though you did not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">receive everything as a gift</span>.</p></li><li><p>you should not talk proudly/boastfully as if you had earned/obtained everything yourselves.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>why do you boast as though you did not?:</strong> This is a third rhetorical question. It functions as a rebuke. Paul was telling the believers in Corinth that they should not be boasting in the way they were. It was foolish and wrong to boast about things they had been given. So there are least two ways to translate this question:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>as a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>why do you brag as if you did not receive it as a gift? (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a rebuke. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You should not boast as though you had not received it.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this question in the way that is natural in your language for rebuking someone.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>boast:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>boast</em> means to brag or talk arrogantly. The Corinthians had been thinking and talking as if the things God had given to them made them more important than other people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>as though you did not:</strong> The phrase <em>as though you did not</em> here means “as though you did not receive everything good you possess as a gift from God.” In some languages it may be more natural to leave this phrase implicit. For example, the CEV translates 4:7c-d as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And if it was given to you, how can you brag? (CEV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:7b-d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">If you translate 4:7b as a strong statement, it may be unnatural to repeat the same information in 4:7c. Therefore you may not need to include all of 4:7c. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7b</sup>Everything you have was given you. <sup>7c</sup>And so <sup>7d</sup>do not boast as if you had not received it from God.</p></blockquote></div>",

Since all their abilities came from God, they had no reason to talk proudly about them. Paul talked about Apollos and himself to contrast the suffering that true workers of Christ were enduring with the proud, boastful attitudes of the Corinthians.</p></div><h4>4:8a-c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul continued to rebuke the Corinthians because they felt satisfied, rich, and powerful. They thought of themselves as spiritually successful. In this verse Paul rebuked them in three short sentences. There are two ways to interpret the form of the Greek sentences:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>They are ironic statements. Irony is a figure of speech that involves saying the opposite of what one means in order to criticize or rebuke others. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Already you are satisfied! Already you are rich! You have become kings without us! (NET) <em>(BSB, NIV, RSV, NJB, NCV, KJV, NASB, REB, GW, NET, NLT, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>They are rhetorical questions. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Are you already satisfied? Are you now rich? Have you become kings while we are still nobodies? (CEV) <em>(GNT, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This has the strongest support among the English versions. Paul was using irony to rebuke the Corinthians. He wanted them to change their proud thoughts about themselves. They thought of themselves as successful, as wise and rich and powerful in spiritual things. But actually, in the way God looked at things, their pride and lack of maturity were causing them to be foolish, poor, and weak.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In your translation, you will want to be sure that your readers do not understand these statements literally. There are several ways to translate them:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>using irony or sarcasm. Consider how it might be natural to show this. One way in English is by the use of exaggerated or emphatic language and an exclamation point. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You are already full to the brim! Already multi-millionaires! Already reigning without us!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>How comfortable you are! How wealthy! How royal! You are not like us!</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as statements implying rebuke. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You think you already have everything you need. You think you are rich. You think you have become kings without us. (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as direct rebukes. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You are wrong to act/think as though you already have all you need. You are not rich yet! You are (unlike us) already kings!</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>4:8a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:8a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Already you have all you want.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You are already so satisfied!</p></li><li><p>You seem to have everything you could desire.</p></li><li><p>You act as though you had everything you needed.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Already you have all you want:</strong> The Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>you have all you want</em> are more literally “you are filled,” as in the RSV. This refers to eating and drinking so much that a person does not want anything more to eat or drink. This is a figure of speech. Paul meant that the Corinthian believers thought that they were not lacking anything spiritually. They did not think that they needed any help or instruction from him. So there are several ways of translating this verse part:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>with a metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You have had enough to eat.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>with a simile that is explained:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Just like people who have eaten so much that they feel satisfied, you act as if you know all you need to know.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>without a figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You act as if you already have all you need spiritually.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You apparently think you have already learned all you need to know about God’s ways.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this figure of speech in a way that is natural in your language. If possible, use language that can refer both to feeling content after having had enough to eat and to feeling content after having enough of something else. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You are already satisfied/content.</p></blockquote><h4>4:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Already you have become rich.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You are already so wealthy/well-off!</p></li><li><p>You seem to have all the blessings there are!</p></li><li><p>You act as though you had every spiritual blessings.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Already you have become rich:</strong> Here Paul used a second figure of speech. It means almost the same as that in 4:8a. Paul was using the word <em>rich</em> as a metaphor for having many spiritual blessings, gifts, and abilities from the Holy Spirit. The Corinthians seemed to think that they had received all the spiritual blessings possible. So there are several ways to translate this figure of speech:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>using a metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you have come into your fortune already! (REB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>using and explaining a metaphor or simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You are like rich men—you don’t need anything from anyone!</p></blockquote></li><li><p>with no figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You already have all the spiritual blessings there are to have!</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">As in the previous verse part, it may be possible to use language that has both a figurative and a non-figurative meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You are indeed very successful/well-off!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You already have all there is to have!</p></blockquote><h4>4:8c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:8c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Without us, you have become kings.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You are reigning already!

But we<sup>(excl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">evangelists/apostles</span> are not yet in that position.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Without us:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the phrase <em>Without us</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “and we are not kings like you.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>even though we are not (GNT) <em>(GNT, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “apart from our help.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>without any help from us (NJB) <em>(NJB, probably the NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Many English versions are ambiguous (BSB, NIV, RSV, NET, REB, NLT, NCV, GW, NASB, KJV, ESV). It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This fits better with the context of 4:8e.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you have become kings:</strong> This is another figure of speech. The Corinthians felt themselves to be as prosperous, strong, and powerful as <em>kings</em>. There are two ways to translate this metaphor:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>using a metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you have come into your kingdom (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are already reigning!</p></blockquote></li><li><p>explaining the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are as prosperous/powerful as kings!</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">In this verse part, it is not recommended that you remove the metaphor altogether. The New Testament frequently uses this metaphor to speak of the spiritual blessings Christians will enjoy after Christ returns. See, for example, 2 Timothy 2:12.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>kings:</strong> A king is a legal, hereditary ruler. If kings are not common in your area, it may be natural to use a more general word for leaders, such as “rulers.”</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:8c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reverse the order of these phrases.

Since all their abilities came from God, they had no reason to talk proudly about them. Paul talked about Apollos and himself to contrast the suffering that true workers of Christ were enduring with the proud, boastful attitudes of the Corinthians.</p></div><h4>4:9</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In this verse Paul compared himself and the other apostles to prisoners about to die in an arena. These prisoners entered the arena last, behind the more important people. They were forced to fight until they died. Other people watched this for amusement. The apostles were like these prisoners in two ways: first, they were in the worst possible place, and second, everyone could watch their suffering. Here are some other ways to translate this verse:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For it seems to me that God has given the very last place to us apostles, like people condemned to die in public as a spectacle for the whole world of angels and of human beings. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But it seems to me that God has put us apostles in last place, like those sentenced to die. We are like a show for the whole world to see—angels and people. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It seems to me that God has put us apostles in the worst possible place. We are like prisoners on their way to death. Angels and the people of this world just laugh at us. (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:9a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:9a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For it seems to me that</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For I think it is like this:</p></li><li><p>For this is what I think.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>For</em> here introduces Paul’s basis for saying that he wished he and the other apostles were reigning like kings.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it seems to me:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>it seems to me</em> here introduces how Paul perceived things. Paul began to tell his emotional reaction to how the Corinthians were acting. It may be natural to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It feels as though</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I think that (RSV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>God has displayed us apostles at the end of the procession,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>God has put us<sup>(excl)</sup>, Christ’s apostles, in the last place of all.</p></li><li><p>It is as if God has caused us<sup>(excl)</sup> apostles to appear as the most despised/insignificant of all people.</p></li><li><p>God has caused us<sup>(excl)</sup>, Christ’s representatives/messengers, to be viewed with no honor/respect.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God has displayed us apostles:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>displayed</em> means to show or cause others to see something. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>exhibited (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>at the end of the procession:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>at the end of the procession</em> is literally “last.” This can refer to being last in line or last in place. In either case, it figuratively refers to being last in importance, lowest in rank. Paul was saying that the apostles were in the worst possible place. They were certainly not kings. Try to translate this with an expression that implies being both last in place or time and last in importance. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>last of all (RSV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>like prisoners appointed for death.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It is as if</span> we have been sentenced to a public death.</p></li><li><p>We are like <span data-bnType=\"implied\">criminals/prisoners</span> about to be killed in front of everyone.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">People make fun of us</span><sup>(excl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and treat us badly,</span> just as if we<sup>(excl)</sup> were people who are going to be killed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the arena</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>like prisoners appointed for death:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>prisoners appointed for death</em> is an adjective indicating that these people were about to die. In this context, it describes criminals or prisoners of war who were going to be put to death. The phrase <em>like prisoners appointed for death</em> is a simile comparing the apostles to these condemned prisoners. Other ways to translate this verse part include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as though sentenced to death (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We are like prisoners on their way to death. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We<sup>(excl)</sup> are like the people who will be killed.</p></blockquote><h4>4:9d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:9d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>We have become a spectacle to the whole world, to angels as well as to men.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Many people are watching us<sup>(excl)</sup>, both people on earth and angels in heaven, to see what is going to happen to us.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I say this because</span> because everyone is watching us<sup>(excl)</sup> to see what will happen to us. Not only people but also angels are watching us.</p></li><li><p>as if we<sup>(excl)</sup> were a public show for the entire angelic and human cosmos/creation.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek this verse part connects to the previous verse part with a conjunction that the RSV translates as “because.” In this context it introduces the basis for what Paul had just said. The apostles were like men condemned to die in the arena because, or in the sense that, the whole world watched them as they suffered.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>We have become a spectacle:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>spectacle</em> refers to a display or theatrical show. The NCV translates this as a simile:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We are like a show (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>We have become:</strong> The context of 4:9b makes it clear that God was the one who caused the apostles to be a spectacle or show. So it is also possible to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> made us</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to the whole world, to angels as well as to men:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>world</em> refers here to the whole created order, including both the realm of angels and the realm of humans.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The KJV translates this phrase as though there were three separate entities: “unto the world, and to angels, and to men.” This is not followed by most other English versions. The BSB, NIV, NJB, GNT, and RSV/NRSV all understand the world/universe to consist of two groups: angels and men. At first reading the RSV and NRSV appear ambiguous (“to the world, to angels and to men/mortals”), but the absence of a comma after the word <em>angels</em> shows that angels and men together form <em>the world</em>. Had the RSV and NRSV intended to refer to three separate entities, they would have said “to the world, to angels, and to men.” Elsewhere they consistently use a serial comma for such phrases: see 5:11, 14:26, and 2 Cor 6:6–7.</span></span></p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:9a-d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The GNT translates 4:9a-d as one sentence in order to make it clear that the “spectacle” consisted of a public death:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For it seems to me that God has given the very last place to us apostles, like people condemned to die in public as a spectacle for the whole world of angels and of human beings.

In each of these statements Paul used a type of expression called irony. This is a kind of statement that states the opposite of what it really means. It is often used to rebuke people. Some translations indicate that the statements are a form of irony by putting exclamation marks (!) at the end of each sentence. In your translation, make sure that it is clear that Paul was rebuking the Corinthians. He was not praising them.</p><h4>4:10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>We are fools for Christ,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>We<sup>(excl)</sup> are/appear foolish because we work for Christ!</p></li><li><p>You think we<sup>(excl)</sup> are acting foolishly for the sake of Christ!</p></li><li><p>You seem to think that we<sup>(excl)</sup> are fools as we<sup>(excl)</sup> live for Christ,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>We are fools for Christ:</strong> Paul continued to use irony.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>How wise you are in Christ!</p></blockquote></li><li><p>using a literal statement.

It means to have no authority to be God’s representative and no power to influence people. This is still irony. Paul did not mean that he and the other apostles <u>really</u> had no power. Rather, the world’s people mistakenly <u>thought</u> that he was weak. So there are two ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>as an ironic statement.

Paul was continuing to speak ironically. He meant “You think you are so strong spiritually!” It is likely that some of the Corinthians were talking proudly about their spiritual abilities. See the notes on 1:5. Paul wanted them to know that God did not like their proud talk. So there are two ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>as an ironic statement.

There are two ways of translating this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>with a passive verb.

Probably the difference is that in 4:12b Paul was referring to people directly insulting the apostles, and here in 4:13a he was referring to people saying bad things <u>about the apostles</u> to others. To “slander” someone is to try to ruin their good name by saying untrue bad things about them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a passive clause. There are two ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>with a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we are slandered (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>our reputations are attacked (GW)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>with an active verb.

Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we speak nice words about them (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we remain courteous (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>4:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Up to this moment we have become the scum of the earth, the refuse of the world.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Even now people treat us<sup>(excl)</sup> as if we<sup>(excl)</sup> were rubbish/garbage that they throw away, or like dirt/scum that they scrape off a pot.</p></li><li><p>Right up to this day/hour people still do not respect us<sup>(excl)</sup>. They say we<sup>(excl)</sup> are worthless.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Up to this moment:</strong> This means the same as “To this very hour” in 4:11a. See the notes there. Paul made it clear that people were still treating Christ’s representatives and workers badly, even at the time he was writing this letter.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In the Greek, this phrase comes at the end of the verse. Combined with the similar phrase at the beginning of verse 11, these phrases seem to give the boundaries of Paul’s statements that apply only to the apostles. In verses 8 to 10, Paul compared the Corinthians with the apostles but in verses 11 through 13, he no longer makes comparisons with the Corinthians. Translators should use this structure if it is appropriate for their language.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we have become the scum of the earth, the refuse of the world:</strong> Paul used these two figures of speech to describe himself and Christ’s other workers. He compared them to rubbish because people considered them worthless and treated them badly. There are two ways to translate these figures of speech:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>keep the figures of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we are treated like the world’s garbage, like everybody’s trash (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>People treat us like dirt, like the world’s unwanted junk.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>translate the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>People treat us<sup>(excl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">apostles</span> as if we<sup>(excl)</sup> were of no value.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Your language may have colorful figures of speech that you can use to translate this. Translate this in such a way that it is clear that people scorned and despised the apostles.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the scum of the earth:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>scum</em> literally refers to anything people remove when they clean. This would include dirt, trash, rubbish, and whatever people throw away.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the refuse of the world:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>refuse</em> means anything people remove when they scrape or wash things. This would include, for example, what a person removes from a pot by scraping or scouring.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The meanings of the two words “scum” and <em>refuse</em> are close. They both refer to something that people think of as worthless, no longer any good. What Paul meant by these metaphors is that people were treating Christ’s workers very badly. Sometimes they were trying to kill them or drive them away. They treated them as if they were unimportant.</p>",

Paul did not mean that the Corinthian believers really did have ten thousand guardians. But however many they had, none of them were like Paul. You can reword this sentence like this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You may have had many teachers in your Christian life. But even if you had ten thousand teachers…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>ten thousand:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates literally as <em>ten thousand</em> was used to indicate a vague but impossibly large number. In translating it, you should try to translate it as a strong statement. There may be a word you use that shows you are exaggerating, such as the English slang “zillion.” In many languages it will probably be more natural to say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a billion/million/trillion</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>countless/innumerable</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>too many to count</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>guardians in Christ:</strong> The phrase <em>guardians in Christ</em> indicates that these guardians were people who helped the Corinthians to follow Christ. You may also translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Christian guardians</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>leaders who have helped you in the Christian life</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>guardians:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>guardians</em> can also mean “caretaker.” It literally means “one who leads children.” In the Greek culture of Paul’s time, a guardian took care of a boy all the time he was not in school. He trained the boy and watched over him. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>tutors (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>guides (RSV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>you do not have many fathers;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>not many people are <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> fathers to you.</p></li><li><p>only one person is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> your father.</p></li><li><p>But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am</span> the only person who is your father <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the Christian way.</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you do not have many fathers:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>you do not have many fathers</em> means “you have only one father.” This is a metaphor. Paul was talking about himself as the one who had first taught the Corinthians about Christ. If a literal translation would suggest physical, biological fatherhood, it may be necessary to follow the NLT:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you have only one spiritual father (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>4:15c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:15c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For I am the one who first proclaimed the good news to you<sup>(plur)</sup> and so became your father in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the family of</span> Christ Jesus.</p></li><li><p>For I am your father.

He said that Christian leaders are servants of Christ and should be judged only by Christ. Some Corinthian believers were saying that they did not have to listen to Paul’s teaching. Paul encouraged the Corinthians to respect and obey him as their spiritual father.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other possible section headings include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul encouraged the Corinthians to respect him and Apollos</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul and Apollos deserved respect as Christ’s servants</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1047004014\" data-endVerseId=\"1047004021\"><h3>Paragraph 4:14–21</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul wanted the Corinthians to change the way they were thinking about him and accept his authority again. So he used another metaphor—that of a father with his children—to help them understand how they should respect and obey him.</p></div><h4>4:17a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:17a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>That is why I have sent you Timothy,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>That is why I have sent Timothy to visit you.</p></li><li><p>That is the reason I have asked/ordered Timothy to go to Corinth.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>That is why:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB has translated as <em>That is why</em> is literally “For this.” In this case, the pronoun <em>That</em> refers to what immediately precedes it. It refers to the clause “I urge you to imitate me.” Because Paul wanted the Corinthians to imitate him, he sent Timothy to them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I have sent you Timothy:</strong> Paul wanted Timothy to visit the Corinthians. In some languages it may be natural to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have asked/ordered Timothy to go/come to you.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have told Timothy to visit you.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I have sent:</strong> In the Greek this verb is in the past tense: “I sent.” There are two ways to understand this:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Paul meant that he had <u>already sent</u> Timothy. When Paul wrote this letter, Timothy had already left Ephesus (where Paul was) and was on his way to Corinth. See Acts 19:22. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have sent you Timothy (NJB) <em>(BSB, CEV, KJV, RSV, NASB, REB, GW, NJB, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Paul meant that Timothy was still with him in Ephesus, but he <u>was planning to send</u> him to Corinth soon. By the time the Corinthians received this letter, Timothy would already be on his way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am sending to you Timothy (GNT) <em>(NIV, GNT, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because there is stronger commentary support for it. Paul probably meant that Timothy had already left Ephesus.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is good evidence from the Bible itself to support this interpretation:(a) Paul did not mention Timothy in 1:1 as he did at the beginning of other letters when Timothy was with him (2 Corinthians 1:1, Philippians 1:1, Colossians 1:1, 1 and 2 Thessalonians 1:1, Philemon).(b) In 1 Corinthians 16:10 Paul said, “If Timothy should come…,” instead of “When Timothy comes….” Paul was not sure if Timothy would arrive in Corinth or not.</span></span></p><h4>4:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>my beloved and faithful child in the Lord.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He is like my child in the Lord. I love him and can depend on him.</p></li><li><p>I love him like a son. He is a believer and constantly/faithfully helps me.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>my beloved and faithful child in the Lord:</strong> There are two possible ways to interpret the Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>my beloved and faithful child in the Lord</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Timothy was <u>faithful to Paul</u>, his spiritual father in Christ. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a dear and faithful son to me in the Lord (NJB) <em>(BSB, NJB, RSV, GNT, NET, NASB, NLT, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>As Paul’s spiritual son, Timothy was <u>faithful to the Lord</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I love him like a son, and he is a faithful servant of the Lord. (CEV) <em>(CEV, REB, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The NIV, KJV, and NCV are more ambiguous and do not explicitly say to whom Timothy was faithful. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) because it has stronger translation support. Paul considered Timothy to be his faithful son as they followed Christ together.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>my beloved and faithful child:</strong> Timothy was not Paul’s child in the physical sense. Paul was Timothy’s spiritual father. See 1 Timothy 1:2. Paul had taught and trained Timothy, and Timothy had become one of Paul’s helpers.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>faithful:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>faithful</em> means trustworthy or dependable. In some languages it may be natural to translate it as a verb phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>I can trust him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>I can rely/depend on him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>he keeps his promises</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in the Lord:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>in the Lord</em> here probably indicates that Timothy belonged to the Lord. He was a believer. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in the Christian life (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the Lord:</strong> This probably refers to the Lord Jesus. But it is best to keep your translation ambiguous unless you have a good reason not to.</p><h4>4:17c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:17c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He will remind you of my way of life in Christ Jesus,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He will remind you what I teach and how I behave as a follower of Christ Jesus,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">When he arrives,</span> he will tell you again about the way I live as I follow Christ’s ways.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He will remind you of my way of life in Christ Jesus:</strong> This verse part indicates that Timothy would help the Corinthians remember Paul and how he lived as a Christian. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will help you remember my way of life in Christ Jesus. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Timothy will tell you what I do to follow Christ. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>my way of life:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>my way of life</em> is literally “my ways.” Paul was probably referring not only to his behavior, the way he acted, but also to the reasons for his behavior and to his way of thinking.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in Christ Jesus:</strong> In this context the common phrase <em>in Christ Jesus</em> likely goes with “my way of life.” The phrase “my way of life in Christ Jesus” thus refers to the way Paul lived as a follower/believer in Christ Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Christ Jesus:</strong> There is a textual problem here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some Greek manuscripts say <em>Christ Jesus</em>. <em>(BSB, NIV, NRSV, GNT, NLT, NCV)</em></p></li><li><p>Some Greek manuscripts say <em>Christ</em>. <em>(RSV, KJV, NASB, ESV, NJB, REB, NET, CEV, GW)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is uncertain which form is original. Either is acceptable. It is recommended that you use the form found in the major language version in your area.</p><h4>4:17d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:17d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>which is exactly what I teach everywhere in every church.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>which is the same thing that I teach to believers in every town/place I go.</p></li><li><p>And this is the same way that I teach in all God’s groups everywhere.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>which is exactly what I teach everywhere in every church:</strong> This verse part indicates that Paul’s way of life was in agreement with his public teaching. He acted in the same way that he taught all other believers to act. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>just as I teach it in all the churches everywhere (NCV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:17c-d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to connect 4:17c-d with a word meaning “and.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Timothy will tell you what I do to follow Christ and how it agrees with what I always teach about Christ in every church. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will remind you of the principles which I follow in the new life in union with Christ Jesus and which I teach in all the churches everywhere. (NJB)</p></blockquote><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:17a-d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reorder the information in these verse parts and tell about Timothy’s character at the end. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>17a</sup>That’s why I’ve sent Timothy to you <sup>17c</sup>to help you remember my Christian way of life <sup>17d</sup>as I teach it everywhere in every church. <sup>17b</sup>Timothy is my dear child, and he faithfully does the Lord’s work.

Such a journey would take at least two or three weeks, and perhaps longer if Paul stopped to visit other churches on his way.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>if the Lord is willing:</strong> The phrase <em>if the Lord is willing</em> indicates that Paul was willing to change his plans if the Lord wanted him to.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the Lord:</strong> In this context the phrase <em>the Lord</em> could refer to either the Lord Jesus or the Lord God.

He did not really care about what they claimed about themselves. He wanted to see whether they acted in the power of God through the Holy Spirit. Other ways to translate these verse parts include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I shall find out not what these self-important people say, but what power they have.

It did not matter to him very much what these people were actually saying. The BSB has supplied the word <em>only</em>. Consider whether or not this is necessary in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>but what power they have:</strong> There are at least two ways to interpret this:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to the power that God’s Spirit gives believers to do God’s work.

People would see this in the lives of the believers, their love, joy, peace, patience, and kindness (Galatians 5:22–23).</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Both are part of the work of God’s kingdom, his rule over the lives of believers.

The things that the Corinthians were saying about their Christian lives were not so important. What was important was whether they were actually living their Christians lives using and demonstrating the power of God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the kingdom of God:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the kingdom of God</em> refers to God’s ruling over his people. Here are a few suggestions as to how to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God rules in a person’s life</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When God rules over people/us…,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We/People submit to God as king….</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>but of power:</strong> Paul was telling the Corinthians that the important thing was not talking about the kingdom of God but actually seeing God’s power in the lives of people. See the notes on 4:19b for what kind of power Paul is talking about here. Some ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but of the power of Christian living (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it is living by God’s power (NLT)</p></blockquote>",

It is literally “What do you want?” Paul was about to ask the Corinthians to choose between two alternatives. This question introduces the two alternatives. There are several ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>as a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Which do you want…?

Paul could either come to deal with them harshly or he could deal with them in a meek and gentle way. This is a rhetorical question. It is obvious which way was preferable. There are two ways to translate these verse parts:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>as one or more rhetorical questions. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Should I come with punishment, or with love and gentleness?</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a statement or statements.

Here the word refers to a stick that a father would use to correct a disobedient child. Paul used this as a figure of speech. He did not mean that he would come with a real rod. He meant that he would behave firmly and even harshly to the Corinthians. He wanted them to listen to him and obey his authority as Christ’s representative, like disobedient children change and become obedient to a loving father. If a literal translation would suggest that Paul would physically punish the Corinthians, you may need to say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Should I come with a rod to punish you… (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Would you prefer that I be very harsh with you?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Do you want me to be hard on you…?

Several English versions follow this model. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When I come to visit you, would you prefer that I punish you…? (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What do you want me to do when I arrive? Do you want me to be hard on you…?

It can refer to any situation in which people who are not married to one another have sexual relations.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may not be possible to talk about <em>immorality</em> in the abstract. It may be necessary to say that one or more people are behaving in this way. Since the context shows that Paul was thinking primarily of one man, you may be able to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>one of you is behaving immorally</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>one of you is sinning sexually</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>among you:</strong> Paul was indicating that it was someone in the Corinthians’ church group who was committing this sin. A man who said that he was a follower of Christ was breaking God’s laws about sexual purity and marriage.</p><h4>5:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and of a kind that is intolerable even among pagans:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>His sin is so serious/wicked that even heathen people do not practice/permit it.</p></li><li><p>It is so wrong/sinful that even those who do not know God do not do/allow it.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>of a kind that is intolerable even among pagans:</strong> Paul told how bad the specific immorality occurring in the Corinthian church was. He said that it was so bad that even people who did not know the true God did not commit this kind of sin. In some languages it may be necessary to define what <em>kind</em> of sin Paul was referring to. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>such <span data-bnType=\"implied\">incest</span> as is intolerable even among pagans</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek text is more literally “of such a kind not among the pagans.” The BSB has supplied the word <em>intolerable</em>. It is possible to supply other words, such as, for example, “is not permitted.” Paul did not mean that this sin <u>never</u> occurred anywhere else. He meant that it was rare and that when it did happen, people condemned it as evil. They did not view it as acceptable. Someone who behaved like this would be punished. If a literal translation would suggest that this <u>never</u> happened among pagans, you may need to say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you are behaving worse than the Gentiles (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Even the pagans do not accept/practice such immorality!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In the OT God told the Jewish people that it was forbidden for a man to have sexual intercourse with any woman who used to be married to his father. See Leviticus 18:8; Deuteronomy 22:30; Deuteronomy 27:20. The Greeks and Romans agreed that it was wrong for people to marry or sleep with their close relatives, whether they were blood relatives or related through marriage.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>pagans:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>pagans</em> refers to people who were not Jewish. They were called &quot;pagans&quot; because they did not worship the one true God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another other way to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people who do not know God (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>5:1d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:1d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>A man has his father’s wife.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>One of you is living/cohabiting/sleeping with <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a woman who used to be</span> his father’s wife.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">What I am referring to is this:</span> A man in your group has been having sexual relations with his stepmother.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>A man has his father’s wife:</strong> This verse part indicates specifically the type of sexual immorality that Paul had heard about: a man in their group had a sexual relationship with <em>his father’s wife</em>. Perhaps this man’s father had divorced his wife, or perhaps the father had died. We do not know.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>has his father’s wife:</strong> The phrase <em>has his father’s wife</em> is in the present tense. This probably indicates that the man did not have sex with his father’s wife just one time. She was probably his regular sexual partner.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul used a euphemism here. A euphemism is talking about something in a polite way. When Paul said “a man has his father’s wife,” he meant “a man is having sex with his father’s wife.” Paul knew that the people in Corinth would understand what he meant. Consider how people talk about this in your language. Translate this in such a way that people can read it aloud in church without it sounding crude or embarrassing.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>has taken his step-mother</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>is living with his father’s wife (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>is sleeping with his stepmother (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>his father’s wife:</strong> The phrase <em>his father’s wife</em> refers to the man’s step-mother. The man was not having sex with his own mother. This man’s father must have had more than one wife.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:1a-d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse records something that Paul had heard and his own comment on it. In some languages it may be natural to use direct speech for the words that Paul had heard. In those languages it may be necessary to reorder the information and put Paul’s own comment at the end of the verse. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1a</sup>People have told me, <sup>1b</sup>“Someone in the church in Corinth is doing what is immoral. <sup>1c</sup>He is sleeping with his father’s wife!” <sup>1d</sup>Even the pagans do not accept such incestuous behavior!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1a</sup>Some people have said to me, <sup>1d</sup>“In the Corinthian church there is a man who is living with his stepmother.” <sup>1b</sup>This sexual immorality is <sup>1c</sup>so bad that it does not even occur among the heathen!</p></blockquote></div>",

They should have been very sad that a member of their church was living immorally.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The believers should have felt sorrowful for three reasons:1. This man was disobeying God and his laws.2. His sin has caused unbelievers to disrespect the Christians in Corinth, and also to disrespect God and Jesus.3. A sin committed by one person in a group in one sense causes the whole group to be guilty and separated from the blessing of God. An example of this in the OT is recorded in Joshua 7, the story of Achan. Thus the believers in Corinth should be truly mourning about this sin that is being committed by someone who is a member of their group. Compare what other Scriptures say about mourning for people who have committed sin: Ezra 9:1–3, Daniel 9:3–19, and 2 Corinthians 12:21.

They were to treat him as though he were not part of the church. Paul wanted the Corinthians to tell the man that he could not be part of their group. He did not mean that they should physically push or chase the man away. Rather, they should forbid the man from coming to their meetings.

In your translation you will probably want to break it into several sentences. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>3</sup>I am not with you in person, but I am with you in spirit. And I have already judged the man who did that sin as if I were really there. <sup>4</sup>When you meet together in the name of our Lord Jesus, and I meet with you in spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus, <sup>5</sup>hand this man over to Satan.

In this context this word introduces one reason why the Corinthians should have expelled the man who had sinned.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Although I am absent from you in body:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>absent from you in body</em> indicates that Paul was not actually in Corinth in person.

There are three ways of understanding where the phrase “in the name of our Lord Jesus” belongs. The three main views are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>It belongs with the phrase “you are assembled.” The believers came together in the name of the Lord Jesus. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I…have already condemned the man who behaved in this way, just as though I were present in person. When you have gathered together in the name of our Lord Jesus…. (NJB) <em>(BSB, NIV, REB, NCV, NET, ESV, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It belongs with the phrase “I have already pronounced judgment.” Paul passed judgment on the sinner with the authority of the Lord Jesus. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and as if present I have already passed judgment in the name of the Lord Jesus on the man who has done such a thing. When you are assembled… (NRSV) <em>(RSV, GNT, CEV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It belongs with the phrase “hand this man over to Satan.” Paul said the man should be handed over to Satan by the authority of the Lord Jesus. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then, in the name of our Lord Jesus, and with his power, hand such a person over to Satan… (GW) <em>(GW)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">The KJV can be understood either way.

The <u>Passover Feast</u> was held each year in remembrance of the time that the Israelites departed from Egypt. Its name comes from the way the angel of death “passed over” each family that had placed the blood of a lamb on their doorposts. After celebrating the Passover, the Jewish people celebrated a second feast, the <u>Feast of Unleavened Bread</u>. It lasted for seven days. It was called this because people ate bread made without yeast.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul assumed that the Corinthian believers knew about these Jewish holidays. But the people who read your translation may not know about them. In your translation you may want to use a dictionary/glossary or footnotes to explain the Jewish customs of Passover and Unleavened Bread.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Here are some brief explanations about Passover, Feast of Unleavened Bread and yeast. You may want to put information like this into a dictionary (glossary) in the back of your translation, or in a footnote at 1 Corinthians 5:6–8, to explain background information to your readers.<u>Passover</u>: On the day of Passover, the Jewish people remember the day that God freed them from being slaves in Egypt long ago. We read this story in Exodus 12. On that day long ago, God punished the Egyptian people so they would allow the Jewish people to go free. Here is what he did. First he gave the Jewish people these instructions: Each family was to kill a lamb and put its blood on the sides and top of the doorway of their house. Then they were to stay inside the house all night, cook the lamb and eat it. On that same night, God killed every firstborn son in the land of Egypt. But he did not kill anyone who was in a house where there was the blood of a lamb on the door. In the NT, Jesus was killed at the time of the Passover feast (Matthew 26:2; Luke 22:1; John 13:1). Jesus is like a lamb that the Jewish people killed at Passover time, because he died in our place, so that God would not punish us for our sins. See John 1:29, 36; 1 Corinthians 5:7; 1 Peter 1:18–19; Revelation 5; Isaiah 53:6–7; Acts 8:32–35.<u>Feast of Unleavened Bread</u>: This is the name of a special holiday of the Jewish people. Every year they removed all yeast from their houses. They ate bread made with no yeast. They did this beginning on the day of Passover and for the seven days that followed (Exodus 12:15–20). This custom reminded them of the time when they left Egypt long ago. At that time long ago, God caused the Egyptian people to free the Jewish people from being slaves. They left Egypt quickly and did not have time to put yeast in their bread dough (Exodus 12:39).<u>Yeast</u>: This is a sort of fungus that is mixed with flour. When the flour is mixed with water and sugar, the yeast causes the mixture to get bigger. A very small amount of yeast will affect a large amount of flour, water and sugar. In the NT, yeast is often a symbol of evil behavior. See Matthew 16:6–12; Mark 8:15–21; Luke 12:1; 1 Corinthians 5:6–8; Galatians 5:9. But in Matthew 13:33 and Luke 13:20–21, yeast is a symbol of how God’s kingdom becomes bigger.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">In these verses Paul used the Passover lamb and yeast as symbols/metaphors. First, the Passover feast was a reminder of the joy and the freedom from slavery that the Jewish people experienced after God delivered them from the power of the Egyptian king. Slavery can be compared to the bondage that sinning causes us to experience, so the metaphor of Passover refers to a new life of freedom from sin. Second, just as the Jewish people removed yeast from their houses, so the Corinthian believers should remove the immoral man from their church group (5:7a), because the immoral man was like yeast among the believers. Believers should stop behaving in evil ways (5:8).</p></div><h4>5:6a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:6a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Your boasting is not good.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ You should not feel proud about your church group.</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Since/Because there is an immoral person in your group,</span> you should not be talking proudly about yourselves.</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">There is an immoral person in your group.

They had special abilities that God’s Spirit had given them. They were proud of these special abilities and the important roles of leadership that some of them had in their church group. Paul said that, because someone in their group was committing a serious sin, they should not be proud. Actually they had much of which they should be ashamed. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your bragging is not good. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It’s not good for you to brag.

The expected answer is something like “Of course we know that.” Paul asked this rhetorical question so that the Corinthian believers would think start to think truthfully about the situation in their church group. (Compare 3:16a and the note on 3:16a.) Paul wanted them to understand that it was very dangerous for them to allow the immoral man to remain as a member of their group.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are two ways to translate this rhetorical question:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>as a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Don’t you know that a little yeast affects the whole batch of dough? (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You know the saying, “Just a little yeast makes the whole batch rise.” (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">You may translate this in whichever of these ways is the more natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a little leaven works through the whole batch of dough:</strong> This was probably a well-known saying. In English we have a similar saying: “One rotten apple spoils the whole barrel.” James also used a figure of speech with a similar meaning: “Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark” (James 3:5). The meaning of all these metaphors is that something small can have a big influence. Paul used this saying about leaven/yeast to teach that one immoral man in the church causes other people in the church to sin or to suffer. The batch/lump of dough represents the church, God’s group of people. The little bit of leaven represents one person’s wrongdoing and its bad effect on the others.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are several ways to translate this metaphor:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Literally. Do this only if people in your language group understand about leaven and will understand the meaning of the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Don’t you know that a little yeast spreads through the whole batch of dough?

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Just like a little leaven can make a lot of dough rise, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so one immoral man in your group can cause many others to suffer or even fall into sin</span>.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Remove the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Don’t you realize that if even one person is allowed to go on sinning, soon all will be affected? (NLT96)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>leaven:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>leaven</em> refers to a substance that people mix into flour when they are making bread. It is a fungus that causes the bread dough to ferment and rise. In some English versions it is called “yeast.” There are several verses in the Bible where yeast or leaven is a symbol of evil behavior (Matthew 16:6–12; Mark 8:15–21; Luke 12:1; Galatians 5:9). Here Paul used leaven as a metaphor to teach the Corinthian believers that one evil person can influence many people in a group.</p>",

You may want to put information like this into a dictionary (glossary) in the back of your translation, or in a footnote at 1 Corinthians 5:6–8, to explain background information to your readers.<u>Passover</u>: On the day of Passover, the Jewish people remember the day that God freed them from being slaves in Egypt long ago. We read this story in Exodus 12. On that day long ago, God punished the Egyptian people so they would allow the Jewish people to go free. Here is what he did. First he gave the Jewish people these instructions: Each family was to kill a lamb and put its blood on the sides and top of the doorway of their house. Then they were to stay inside the house all night, cook the lamb and eat it. On that same night, God killed every firstborn son in the land of Egypt. But he did not kill anyone who was in a house where there was the blood of a lamb on the door. In the NT, Jesus was killed at the time of the Passover feast (Matthew 26:2; Luke 22:1; John 13:1). Jesus is like a lamb that the Jewish people killed at Passover time, because he died in our place, so that God would not punish us for our sins. See John 1:29, 36; 1 Corinthians 5:7; 1 Peter 1:18–19; Revelation 5; Isaiah 53:6–7; Acts 8:32–35.<u>Feast of Unleavened Bread</u>: This is the name of a special holiday of the Jewish people. Every year they removed all yeast from their houses. They ate bread made with no yeast. They did this beginning on the day of Passover and for the seven days that followed (Exodus 12:15–20). This custom reminded them of the time when they left Egypt long ago. At that time long ago, God caused the Egyptian people to free the Jewish people from being slaves. They left Egypt quickly and did not have time to put yeast in their bread dough (Exodus 12:39).<u>Yeast</u>: This is a sort of fungus that is mixed with flour.

First, the Passover feast was a reminder of the joy and the freedom from slavery that the Jewish people experienced after God delivered them from the power of the Egyptian king. Slavery can be compared to the bondage that sinning causes us to experience, so the metaphor of Passover refers to a new life of freedom from sin. Second, just as the Jewish people removed yeast from their houses, so the Corinthian believers should remove the immoral man from their church group (5:7a), because the immoral man was like yeast among the believers. Believers should stop behaving in evil ways (5:8).</p></div><h4>5:7a-c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse continues the metaphor of the yeast. Consider whether your readers would understand that the yeast refers to sin. There are several ways of translating it:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>literally, keeping the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Clean out the old yeast so that you may be a new batch of dough—you are, in fact, without yeast. (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>explaining something of the meaning of the metaphor. For example, the GNT has made it clear that the expression “old yeast” refers to sin:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You must remove the old yeast of sin so that you will be entirely pure. Then you will be like a new batch of dough without any yeast… (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>removing the metaphor and translating the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Remove this wicked person from among you so that you can stay pure. (NLT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">Consider how much explanation is necessary to make it possible for your readers to understand what Paul was saying.</p><h4>5:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Get rid of the old leaven,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Remove the old yeast <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of sin</span></p></li><li><p>Just as the Jews remove all yeast from their houses before they celebrate the Passover feast, so you should remove/expel this immoral man from your group.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Get rid of the old leaven:</strong> At the time of the Feast of the Unleavened Bread, the Jewish people carefully removed all the old leaven from their homes and then for seven days they ate bread that had no leaven in it. But in this context this is a figure of speech. Paul did not really want the Corinthian to throw leaven out of their houses. The leaven is a symbol of sin, and Paul wanted the Corinthians to get rid of the sin in their church. He wanted them to stop allowing wrongdoing to go on among the people in the church. This would mean expelling from the church the man who had married his step-mother.</p><h4>5:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that you may be a new unleavened batch,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that you may become <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> bread that has no yeast in it, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that is, a pure church</span>.</p></li><li><p>Then you will be <span data-bnType=\"implied\">holy/pure</span>, like new bread made without yeast,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that you may be a new unleavened batch:</strong> This is a purpose clause. Paul said that the Corinthian believers were to throw out the old leaven <u>in order that</u> they might be <em>a new unleavened batch</em>. The phrase <em>a new…batch</em> means a new piece or lump of dough. This is an illustration of a pure and holy church. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then you will be like fresh bread made without yeast (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that you may be like a new batch of bread made without leaven</p></blockquote><h4>5:7c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:7c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>as you really are.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>God has indeed made you clean/pure.</p></li><li><p>just as you really are God’s holy/special people.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as you really are:</strong> The phrase <em>as you really are</em> here means “as you really are new bread without yeast.” This continues the figure of speech. Paul was saying that Christ had forgiven the Corinthians’ sin and made them clean on the inside. They had been cleansed from their sin and therefore they really were God’s holy people. So they should act like it.</p><h4>5:7d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:7d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For Christ has been sacrificed for us<sup>(incl)</sup>, like a Passover lamb.</p></li><li><p>For Christ has died as our<sup>(incl)</sup> sacrifice, our<sup>(incl)</sup> Passover Lamb.</p></li><li><p>For Christ died <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to set us</span><sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">free from our</span><sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">sins</span>. He is like the lamb that the Jews kill/sacrifice at Passover time.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed:</strong> Paul gave the reason for saying that the Corinthians were unleavened or pure. The Corinthians were like a new batch of bread made without yeast because Christ had already been sacrificed for their sins. Christ had already died as their complete payment for sin. He had set them free from being slaves to their old life of sin. This is illustrated by the Passover story. The Jewish people left their life of slavery in Egypt as soon as they had sacrificed their Passover Lamb.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed:</strong> This is a metaphor taken from the Jewish Passover Feast. Passover was the feast/holiday that the Jewish people celebrated immediately before the Feast of Unleavened Bread. On Passover they sacrificed a lamb (young sheep), and then immediately began to use only bread made without yeast for seven days. You can read about those two feasts in Exodus 12:3–8, 14–20 and Leviticus 23:5–7.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a passive clause. There are two ways of translating it:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>with a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Our Passover Lamb is Christ, who has already been sacrificed. (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>with an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ, our passover lamb, has died as our sacrifice.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ has become our sacrifice, our passover lamb.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They have already sacrificed Christ, who is our passover lamb.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Christ, our Passover lamb:</strong> Christ is like a <em>Passover lamb</em> in several ways. The lamb was killed at the first Passover so that God’s people, the Hebrews, would not be killed when God’s angel killed all the firstborn sons in Egypt. In the same way, Christ was killed so that God’s people will not be punished for their sins. Also, on the day that the Hebrews killed the Passover lamb, they were set free from slavery in Egypt. In the same way, Christ died to set us free from being slaves to sin. See the endnote on 5:6–8. In some languages it may be natural to translate this metaphor as a simile:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>Christ is <u>like</u> our Passover Lamb</p></blockquote>",

We read this story in Exodus 12. On that day long ago, God punished the Egyptian people so they would allow the Jewish people to go free. Here is what he did. First he gave the Jewish people these instructions: Each family was to kill a lamb and put its blood on the sides and top of the doorway of their house. Then they were to stay inside the house all night, cook the lamb and eat it. On that same night, God killed every firstborn son in the land of Egypt. But he did not kill anyone who was in a house where there was the blood of a lamb on the door. In the NT, Jesus was killed at the time of the Passover feast (Matthew 26:2; Luke 22:1; John 13:1). Jesus is like a lamb that the Jewish people killed at Passover time, because he died in our place, so that God would not punish us for our sins. See John 1:29, 36; 1 Corinthians 5:7; 1 Peter 1:18–19; Revelation 5; Isaiah 53:6–7; Acts 8:32–35.<u>Feast of Unleavened Bread</u>: This is the name of a special holiday of the Jewish people. Every year they removed all yeast from their houses. They ate bread made with no yeast. They did this beginning on the day of Passover and for the seven days that followed (Exodus 12:15–20). This custom reminded them of the time when they left Egypt long ago. At that time long ago, God caused the Egyptian people to free the Jewish people from being slaves. They left Egypt quickly and did not have time to put yeast in their bread dough (Exodus 12:39).<u>Yeast</u>: This is a sort of fungus that is mixed with flour. When the flour is mixed with water and sugar, the yeast causes the mixture to get bigger. A very small amount of yeast will affect a large amount of flour, water and sugar. In the NT, yeast is often a symbol of evil behavior. See Matthew 16:6–12; Mark 8:15–21; Luke 12:1; 1 Corinthians 5:6–8; Galatians 5:9. But in Matthew 13:33 and Luke 13:20–21, yeast is a symbol of how God’s kingdom becomes bigger.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">In these verses Paul used the Passover lamb and yeast as symbols/metaphors. First, the Passover feast was a reminder of the joy and the freedom from slavery that the Jewish people experienced after God delivered them from the power of the Egyptian king. Slavery can be compared to the bondage that sinning causes us to experience, so the metaphor of Passover refers to a new life of freedom from sin. Second, just as the Jewish people removed yeast from their houses, so the Corinthian believers should remove the immoral man from their church group (5:7a), because the immoral man was like yeast among the believers. Believers should stop behaving in evil ways (5:8).</p></div><h4>5:8a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:8a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Therefore let us keep the feast,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>So let us<sup>(incl)</sup> keep/celebrate the Passover Festival/Feast</p></li><li><p>Since that is true, we<sup>(incl)</sup> should celebrate the new life that Christ has given us.</p></li><li><p>So we<sup>(incl)</sup> should live our new lives</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Therefore:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Therefore</em> introduces the conclusion to Paul’s argument. It is also possible to translate it as</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>then (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>let us keep the feast:</strong> This is a command in the first-person plural. It is also possible to translate it as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we should keep the feast</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>keep the feast:</strong> This is an English idiom. To <em>keep</em> a festival means to celebrate or follow the customs and ceremonies of the festival. But this is also a metaphor. Paul did not mean that believers should literally follow the Jewish customs of Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Paul meant that since Christ has already died to redeem the Corinthians from their sins (5:7d), they should rejoice and act like God’s people who have been freed from sin. So there are at least two ways to translate this verse part:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>literally, keeping the metaphor. For example</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>let us celebrate this feast (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>explaining the meaning of the metaphor.

Here Paul used the metaphor of “old leaven” in a general sense to refer to the Corinthians’ former way of life. Before they became believers they used to act in ways that were malicious and wicked. Here is a way to translate these verse parts so that the meaning of the metaphor is more clear:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We should get rid of the old leaven. That is, we should stop acting in the hateful and evil ways we had in the old times before we became believers.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it will be clearer if you use words like “previous” or “former” rather than <em>old</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not with the leaven you previously/formerly used, that malicious and wicked leaven</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>leavened with malice and wickedness:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>leavened with malice and wickedness</em> here means “the leaven that consists of malice and wickedness.” This phrase helps explain the meaning of Paul’s figure of speech. He was using the phrase “old leaven” to refer to an evil way of life.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>malice and wickedness:</strong> The Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>malice</em> and <em>wickedness</em> mean approximately the same thing. Paul used two words in order to emphasize the idea of evil. He was saying strongly that believers should stay away from every kind of evil and bad behavior. Other ways to translate this phrase include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>vice and wickedness (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>being evil and sinful (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>5:8d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:8d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but with the unleavened bread</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>We<sup>(incl)</sup> should make use only of bread without yeast,</p></li><li><p>Instead, we<sup>(incl)</sup> should act/behave only in ways that are clean/pure.</p></li></ul></div><h4>5:8e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:8e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>of sincerity and of truth.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>acting/behaving sincerely and truthfully.</p></li><li><p>We<sup>(incl)</sup> should always be honest and speak the truth.</p></li></ul></div><h4>5:8d-e</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and of truth:</strong> In 5:8d Paul said that the Corinthian believers should use <em>unleavened bread</em>. In 5:8e he explained what he meant: they should act with <em>sincerity</em> and <em>truth</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>of sincerity and of truth:</strong> Paul probably used the two words <em>sincerity</em> and <em>truth</em> together as a way of saying strongly that believers should follow every kind of good way. They should treat others in only good ways. To behave with <em>sincerity</em> means to speak and act openly, according to one’s true intentions, rather than deceitfully. To act or speak with <em>truth</em> is to be honest and trustworthy. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>of purity and truth (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>be sincere and truthful</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:8</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">There are several ways to reorder these verse parts. Here are two suggestions:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>8a</sup>So don’t celebrate the festival <sup>8c</sup>by being evil and sinful, <sup>8b</sup>which is like serving bread made with yeast. <sup>8e</sup>Be pure and truthful <sup>8d</sup>and celebrate using bread made without yeast.

This translation makes Paul refer to what he is writing here in 1 Corinthians.

The Greek could mean either one. But it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This is the view of the majority of commentators. Paul was probably explaining the command he had given them in his other letter. So another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But now <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I will explain to you what</span> I wrote.</p></blockquote><h4>5:11b-f</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In these verse parts Paul indicated that the believers were not to associate in a friendly way with anyone who called himself a Christian but was deliberately sinning. Paul listed six kinds of serious sins as examples of the sins he was referring to. Paul was referring to anyone and everyone who might claim to be a Christian but continue to behave in these ways. So in some languages it may be natural to use plural forms. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you must not associate with people who call themselves believers but behave immorally, or are greedy, or worship idols, or slander others, or get drunk, or cheat others. Do not even eat with people like this.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reorder these verse parts to put the two commands “you must not associate” and “do not even eat” together. See the General Comment at the end of 5:11f.</p><h4>5:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>not to associate with anyone who claims to be a brother</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Do not spend time with someone who claims/says that he is your fellow believer in Christ,</p></li><li><p>You must not fellowship with people who say that they are Christians</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not to associate with:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>associate with</em> means to mingle freely with them, to fellowship with them, be close to them, and do things with them. See 5:9b, where the same word occurs.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>anyone who claims to be a brother:</strong> Paul was referring to someone who claimed to be a <em>brother</em> in Christ, that is, a believer. If a literal translation would not make this clear, you may need to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>any professing Christian (JBP)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to use a direct quote here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you must not associate with a person who says, “I follow Christ as you do”</p></blockquote><h4>5:11c-e</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">These verse parts lists six ways in which someone could sin. If a person who called himself a believer sinned in any of these ways, the other believers were not to associate with him. In your translation, consider how best to express each type of sin and how to put the expressions into a list in the most natural way. It is natural to connect each of the sins. In some languages it may be natural to use a word meaning “or” after each sin, but in other languages this may not be necessary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The various items in the list can be translated in various ways:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>as a series of verb phrases (describing the various ways of sinning). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who sin sexually, covet things, worship idols, slander others, get drunk or cheat</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a series of nouns (identifying the type of sinner)</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who are fornicators, greedy people, idol worshipers, slanderers, drunkards, swindlers</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a series of adjectival phrases (describing people who sin in these ways).</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who are sexually immoral, greedy/materialistic, idolatrous, slanderous, addicted to alcohol, or dishonest</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">The Greek uses nouns to identify the people (fornicators, idol worshipers, etc). The BSB uses a combination of last two forms, because this is natural in English. Use whatever type is the most natural in your language.</p><h4>5:11c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:11c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but is sexually immoral or greedy,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but yet he/she continues to commit sex/sexual sins, and is greedy for more possessions,</p></li><li><p>but behave immorally, or want more and more things,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but is sexually immoral:</strong> A person who is <em>sexually immoral</em> is one who has sexual relations with someone other than his or her spouse.

Paul used the verbal form of the same word in 4:12b (where the BSB translates it as “vilified”). See the notes there.</p><h4>5:11e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:11e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>a drunkard or a swindler.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>or who becomes drunk or cheats people.</p></li><li><p>or frequently drink too much alcohol, or take other people’s things.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a drunkard:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>drunkard</em> refers to a person who often get drunk/intoxicated by drinking too much alcoholic drink such as beer, wine, or whiskey.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>swindler:</strong> See 5:10b, where the same word occurs.</p><h4>5:11f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:11f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>With such a man do not even eat.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I do not want you to even eat a meal with that kind of a person.</p></li><li><p>Do not even let those people share meals with you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>With such a man do not even eat:</strong> There are two ways to understand this verse part:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means that believers are not to even eat normal meals with people who claim to be Christians but are deliberately sinning.</p></li><li><p>It means that believers are not to allow such people who behave like this to eat communion (the Lord’s Supper) with them.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). In those days, Christians often ate together when they gathered for worship. They often ate normal meals together as well as the Lord’s Supper. Probably Paul was referring to all occasions when the Christians ate together. He did not want them to allow a fellow believer who behaved in sinful ways to eat with them. He did does not want the believers to let such a person think that his bad ways were all right.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:11b-f</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reorder these verse parts by putting the verb from 11b (“do not associate with”) next to the command in 11f (“do not eat with”). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>11b</sup>If people say they are your fellow believers, <sup>11c</sup>but they behave immorally with women or are greedy, <sup>11d</sup>or they worship false gods, or bad-mouth people, <sup>11e</sup>or if they are drunkards or swindlers, <sup>11b</sup>do not fellowship with them. <sup>11f</sup>Do not even eat with them.</p></blockquote></div>",

Paul used it here to introduce the basis for his statements in 5:10 and 11. The GNT introduces this paragraph with the words:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>After all (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>What business of mine is it to judge those outside the church?:</strong> This is the first of two rhetorical questions. Paul used this rhetorical question to try to correct the thinking of the believers just as he did in 5:9 and 10. The expected or implied answer is “None at all.” Paul was really making a strong statement. He meant: “It is not my responsibility to judge wrongdoers who are not a part of our group.” There are two ways to translate this question here:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>as a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Why should I judge outsiders? (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a strong statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is not my business to judge those who are not part of the church. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is no concern of mine to judge outsiders. (NJB)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use whichever form is more natural in your language for making a strong statement.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>What business of mine is it:</strong> Paul used himself as an example of any Christian. He was not just speaking about himself personally. He meant that it is not our job as Christians to judge those who are not Christians. If translating this literally would imply that Paul was speaking only of himself and excluding other Christians, you may need to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>What business of ours<sup>(incl)</sup> is it</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>those outside the church:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>those outside the church</em> is literally <em>those outside</em>. The BSB has supplied the words <em>the church</em> to make the meaning clear. Paul was referring to those who were not part of the church, that is, those who did not believe in Jesus.</p><h4>5:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Are you not to judge those inside?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But certainly you should judge the people who are a part of your church group, shouldn’t you?</p></li><li><p>But you should judge/discipline any people who belong to your church group <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who do the sinful things which I just mentioned.</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Are you not to judge those inside?:</strong> This is a second rhetorical question. The implied answer to the question is: “Yes, it is our responsibility to judge the wrongdoers who are a part of the church.” Paul used this question to make a strong statement. He was emphasizing that the Corinthians were supposed to judge those within the church, that is, believers. There are two ways to translate this verse part:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>with a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Isn’t it your business to judge those who are inside? (GW)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>with a strong statement:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But you must judge the people who are part of the church.

Paul wrote that the believers must punish this man by expelling him from the church. They should not allow this man to meet with them when they gathered to worship God together.

Here it indicates a contrast between who is supposed to judge those inside the church versus who will judge those outside the church. Christians are supposed to judge those within the church and God will judge those outside the church. See also the General Comment on 5:12b-13a. The BSB has not explicitly translated this conjunction, but the NET translates it as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God will judge those outside:</strong> There is a textual problem in this verse part. Not all the Greek texts have the same form of the Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>will judge</em>. As a result, there are two ways to interpret the tense of this verb:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is in the future tense. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God will judge (GNT) <em>(BSB, NIV, NET, NLT, NRSV, NCV, GW, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is in the present tense. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God judges (RSV) <em>(KJV, NASB, ESV, RSV, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions translate in such a way that either meaning is possible. For example, the REB says, “God is their judge,” and the NJB says, “outsiders are for God to judge.” It is good for you to translate in this way. If you must choose between the two options, it is recommended that you follow option (1) and use the future tense. But there is really not much difference in meaning. Paul’s main point was not <u>when</u> God will judge unbelievers. Rather, his main point is this: “God, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">not you,</span> is the one who will judge unbelievers.” The NEB says “God is their judge.”</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:12a-13a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The main point is that people in the church should be judged by the church. If someone is concerned about those outside the church, then he should know that God is the one who will judge them. Some English versions make the main point more clear by rephrasing these verse parts. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12</sup>It isn&apos;t my responsibility to judge outsiders, but it certainly is your job to judge those inside the church who are sinning in these ways. <sup>13</sup>God will judge those on the outside (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Other English versions reorder these verses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12a</sup>It is not my business to judge those who are not part of the church. <sup>13a</sup>God will judge them. <sup>12b</sup>But you must judge the people who are part of the church (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">You should translate this in a way that makes the main point clear.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">There is a contrast between the pronoun “you” in 5:12b and the word “God” in 5:13a. Consider how you might indicate this contrast in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is for you to judge those inside the church, but God is the judge of those outside.</p></blockquote></div><h4>5:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Expel the wicked man from among you.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>So, “Do not allow the immoral man to associate with your group.”</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">As God’s book says:</span> Tell this man who is behaving wickedly that he can no longer be part of your church group.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Expel the wicked man from among you:</strong> This is a command. Paul ordered the Corinthian believers to reject the man who had sexual relations with his stepmother. He quoted words that Moses had spoken (Deuteronomy 17:7). He did not specifically say that this was a quotation from the Scriptures, but you may wish to note this in a footnote. It is also possible to follow the GNT and make this explicit in the text:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">As the scripture says,</span> “Remove the evil person from your group.” (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Expel the wicked man:</strong> Paul meant that the Corinthians should not allow the wicked man to be part of their church. They should not let him worship with them. Paul did not mean that the Corinthian believers should physically shove or chase the man out of their meeting. If you translate this literally, be careful that people do not misunderstand it in this way.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:12–13</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"2\">There are four sentences in 5:12–13. The main point of these verse parts is that people in the church should be judged by the church. If someone is concerned about those outside the church, then he should know that God is the one who will judge them. Some English versions make the main point more clear by rephrasing these verse parts. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>12</sup>It isn&apos;t my responsibility to judge outsiders, but it certainly is your responsibility to judge those inside the church who are sinning. <sup>13</sup>God will judge those on the outside; but as the Scriptures say, “You must remove the evil person from among you.” (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You may want to put the four sentences in a different order in order to finish Paul’s comments on judging unbelievers before starting his comments on judging believers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>12a</sup>It is not my business to judge those who are not part of the church. <sup>13a</sup>God will judge them. <sup>12b</sup>But you must judge the people who are part of the church. <sup>13b</sup>The Scripture says, “You must get rid of the evil person among you.” (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>12a</sup>After all, it is none of my business to judge outsiders. <sup>13a</sup>God will judge them. <sup>12b</sup>But should you not judge the members of your own fellowship? <sup>13b</sup>As the scripture says, “Remove the evil person from your group.” (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>12a</sup>We believers do not need to decide about people who are not fellow believers. <sup>13a</sup>God will do that. <sup>12b</sup>But you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believers in Corinth</span> should decide about the punishment of your own church members. <sup>13b</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">So then, in the case of the man who is behaving immorally,</span> you should remove him from your group of believers.</p></blockquote></div>",

At least one of the believers had taken another believer to a pagan/civil court to settle a dispute. Paul told the Corinthian believers that this was unwise and harmful to the church. He taught them what they as believers should do if another believer wronged them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other possible section headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Believers should not go to law before unbelievers</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christians should not sue other Christians in pagan courts</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Advice about lawsuits</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1047006001\" data-endVerseId=\"1047006006\"><h3>Paragraph 6:1–6</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph Paul told the Corinthian believers how foolish they were to take disputes among themselves to be settled before unbelievers. He gave them some reasons why they should not have unbelievers judge between them. Paul used sarcasm and rhetorical questions to show the Corinthians how serious the situation in their church was. He wanted them to feel ashamed of themselves. They should settle disputes between believers themselves.</p></div><h4>6:1a-c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">This is a long rhetorical question. Paul used this rhetorical question to show that he strongly disapproved of taking a dispute between Christians to a pagan/civil court. There are two ways of translating it:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>as a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When any of you has a legal dispute with another, does he dare go to court before the unrighteous rather than before the saints? (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If one of you has a grievance against another, it is quite wrong for you/him to go before the ungodly for judgment, instead of before God’s people.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When one of you has a complaint against another, you should not dare to go to court to settle the matter in front of wicked people. You should settle it in front of God’s holy people!</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>6:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>If any of you has a grievance against another,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ When/If one of you has a disagreement/argument with another believer,</p></li><li><p>¶ When/If you<sup>(sing/plur)</sup> have a legal problem with a fellow believer,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse begins a new topic in a new section. There is no special word or phrase to mark this in the Greek or the BSB. Consider if you need an introductory word or phrase here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>If any of you has a grievance against another:</strong> This clause introduces a situation that can and does happen from time to time.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Greek here is a participle phrase, as the KJV translates: “Dare any of you, having a matter against another.” It is acceptable to understand and translate it as a conditional clause, as the BSB and some other versions do. It is a potential fact conditional clause with a probable future fulfillment. See Appendix 1, sense 2 (c).</span></span> Disputes between believers will occur occasionally. It is therefore possible to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When one of you has a grievance against a brother…. (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When you have something against another Christian…. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a grievance:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>a grievance</em> is a general one meaning “a matter, an affair.” In this context it refers to a legal matter such as a lawsuit. Apparently at least one believer in the Corinthian church had already done something wrong to another believer. Perhaps he had cheated him or taken something that belonged to him. The second believer had gone to a court in Corinth and accused his fellow believer before the judge, who was not a believer.</p><h4>6:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>how dare he go to law before the unrighteous</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>how could you/he think of asking ungodly people to judge between you?</p></li><li><p>you should not dare/presume to go to/before a judge who is not one of God’s people.</p></li><li><p>it is totally/absolutely wrong/shocking to take your disagreement to a public court, where the judges do not know/respect God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>how dare he go to law before the unrighteous:</strong> These words indicate that Paul was upset/shocked by what he heard. He was implying: “A believer should not even think of taking another believer before an unbelieving judge.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>how dare he go to law:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>dare</em> means to be bold or courageous to do something beyond what people would normally expect. In this context it means to act boldly in a disrespectful or shameless way. Another way to translate it is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he should be ashamed to take it</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>before the unrighteous:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>unrighteous</em> can also be translated as “ungodly.” Here it refers to people who are not believers, not members of the church. Paul was probably talking about the judges in the public courts in Corinth. These judges worked for the Roman government and did not know or respect God’s laws.</p><h4>6:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>instead of before the saints!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Why not rather ask God’s people to judge?</p></li><li><p>Instead, the right thing for you to do is to ask people who belong to God to decide your case.</p></li><li><p>You should ask other believers/Christians to help make peace between you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>instead of before the saints:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>instead of before the saints</em> is a short way of saying “he should take his dispute before the saints.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the saints:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>saints</em> here refers to believers, Christians. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s people (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>saints</em> is related to the word “sanctified” that Paul used in 1:2b (see the notes there). Believers are people set apart for God’s service. They have been made holy. This word is also used in this way in Acts 9:13 and Philippians 1:1.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:1a-c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to break up this long question into two or more questions.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some Greek texts do punctuate in this way.

There are two ways to translate this question:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>as a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Don’t you know that God’s people will judge the world? (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a statement.

Paul used this rhetorical question to introduce another reason why the Corinthians did not need outside judges to settle disputes between them. He reminded the Corinthians of something someone had taught them before: Christians will someday <em>judge angels</em>. He reminded them of this in order to emphasize the difference between the important things believers will judge in the future and the unimportance of the disputes they were having at that time. There are two ways to translate this rhetorical question:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>as a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Are you not aware that we are to judge angels…? (REB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a statement.

So it would be good to use an expression that can cover any of those. Paul was emphasizing the high place/position God’s people will share with Christ in the kingdom of God. Believers will share in Christ’s authority over angels. You should not include in your translation any implied information about what God’s people will judge angels for.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Scriptures teach that angels, God’s heavenly messengers, will answer to God for the choices they make about serving God or the devil. See, for example, 2 Peter 2:4; Jude 6; Revelation 20:10; Matthew 25:41. But Paul does not discuss this here.</span></span></p><h4>6:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>How much more the things of this life!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>So then, we<sup>(incl)</sup> are certainly able to decide about the usual/ordinary disagreements which come up in this life!</p></li><li><p>So surely you/we<sup>(incl)</sup> can settle little everyday problems/arguments!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>How much more the things of this life!:</strong> Paul did not write a complete sentence here.

There is no punctuation in the earliest Greek manuscripts. The third edition of the UBS Greek New Testament notes the possibility of placing a question mark after 6:3a; the fourth edition places one only at the end of 6:3b. The translator can do what is natural in his or her language. The RSV, GNT, and NJB, like the BSB, place a question mark at the end of 6:3a. The RSV and NJB then punctuate 6:3b as a question, and the GNT punctuates it as an exclamation.

These are all <em>things of this life</em>.

The RSV translates it as “then.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if you need to settle everyday matters:</strong> It is likely that such disputes would occur from time to time.

When a Christian opposed another Christian in court, they were both doing something wrong. In verse 7 Paul rebuked any believer who took his fellow believer to court for doing wrong to him. Then in verse 8, Paul rebuked to any believer who had done wrong to his Christian brother.</p></div><h4>6:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means that you are thoroughly defeated already.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ You are arguing with one another in front of judges. That by itself shows that you have totally failed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to live/behave like God’s people</span>.</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Even if the judge decides you are right,</span> in God’s eyes you are wrong for taking a fellow believer to court.</p></li><li><p>¶ To go to law against another believer is in itself a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">moral</span> failure/defeat.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means that you are thoroughly defeated already:</strong> This verse part indicates that Paul totally disapproved of believers using the legal system to attack one another. He considered that in a situation like this neither party could truly be the winner. Ultimately, both lost; that is, they harmed themselves and the church. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The fact that you have lawsuits against each other shows that you are already defeated. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When one of you takes another to court, all of you lose. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In fact, to have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat for you. (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>lawsuits:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>lawsuits</em> is a different word from the words translated as “disputes” in 6:1a and 6:4a, but the meaning is about the same. The word Paul uses here is a more technical word for a court case or lawsuit.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you are thoroughly defeated:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>you are…defeated</em> is more literally “is a failure for you.” Paul was saying that a lawsuit between believers is a spiritual and moral failure. Even if the person who takes his fellow believer before an ungodly judge wins the case, both he and the whole church have failed in their Christian lives. They did not let God’s Spirit guide and control how they lived.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The BSB translates this as a passive clause. There are two ways of translating it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>with a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you have been defeated</p></blockquote></li><li><p>with an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you have failed</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">If you must show the one who has caused the defeat or loss, you could say the devil is the one who has caused it. For example, this could be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you have been defeated <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by the devil</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>thoroughly:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>thoroughly</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It goes with the verb “defeated.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The very fact that you have legal disputes among yourselves shows that you have failed <u>completely</u>. (GNT) <em>(BSB, GNT, NIV, KJV, GW, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It goes with the word “lawsuits.” For example, the RSV says;</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>To have lawsuits <u>at all</u> with one another is defeat for you. <em>(RSV, REB, NJB, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This is supported by the majority of commentators.</p><h4>6:7b-8b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 6:7b-d Paul talked mostly to the persons in the Corinthian church who were wronged or cheated and who took their fellow believers to court. In 6:8a Paul talked to the persons who did wrong and cheated others. But in the whole passage Paul was also talking to the whole group. He wanted them all to listen to what he said and learn from it. He used the plural pronoun meaning “you.”</p><h4>6:7b-c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?:</strong> These are both rhetorical questions. Paul was talking mainly to those who accuse others, that is, those who took their fellow believers to court. He wanted those who accuse others to understand that, even though they had been wronged, it would have been better to not take their Christian brothers to court. Paul was using these questions to make strong statements that it was better to be wronged or cheated than to take other believers to court. There are therefore two ways of translating these verse parts:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>as rhetorical questions. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Why not let yourselves be wronged? Why not let yourselves be cheated? (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as statements.

It would be better/preferable to be cheated.</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>6:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Why not rather be wronged?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Why not rather suffer/accept the wrong/injustice?</p></li><li><p>It would be better to let the other believer wrong you.</p></li><li><p>If another Christian has done something wrong to you, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">do not go to a judge to accuse him</span>. It is better to do nothing.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Why not rather be wronged?:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>be wronged</em> means to submit to or accept/suffer injustice. This is a passive clause. There are two ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>with a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Would it not be better to be treated unjustly?</p></blockquote></li><li><p>with an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Why not rather suffer wrong? (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Why not rather submit to wrong?

Just let it be that way.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Why not rather be cheated?:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>be cheated</em> refers to a situation in which someone has lost money or possessions because another person has deceived them. This is another passive clause. There are two ways to translate it:</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:7b-c</strong></h5><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>with a passive verb.

We can tell this because of two things: First, Paul uses a strong contrast connector <em>alla</em> “but, however.” Here it means: “but on the other hand.” In the second place, he changes from passive forms of the verbs (“you are wronged…you are cheated”) in 6:7b-c to active forms of the same verbs (“you do wrong and you cheat”) in 6:8a. It is as if he turns to talk to the wrongdoer. The BSB translation gives the impression that Paul is talking here to the same person as in 6:7. But the change from passive to active verb forms does not allow that.</span></span> The word <em>you</em> is emphasized in the Greek sentence. The BSB has shown this by supplying the word <em>yourselves</em>. Another way to show this emphasis is by following the REB:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But instead, it is you who are wronging and defrauding.

The basis is that the unrighteous will not enter God’s kingdom (verse 9). Some of the Corinthian believers had been very unrighteous in the past, but Paul reminded them that they should now live righteous lives because of what Christ has done for them (verse 11). Therefore they should no longer take each other to court.</p></div><h4>6:9a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:9a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Have you forgotten that evil people will not possess/receive the kingdom of God?</p></li><li><p>¶ Let me remind you that people who live sinful/bad lives will not be able to live in God’s kingdom.</p></li><li><p>¶ You know very well that wrongdoers/evildoers will not be among God’s people when he rules/reigns as king.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. Paul used this question to remind the believers of something they seemed to have forgotten. See the notes on 6:2a. There are two ways to translate this verse part:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>as a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? (RSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Surely you know that the wicked will not possess God’s kingdom. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Translate this in a way that is natural in your language for reminding people of something they should have known.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God:</strong> This clause indicates that wicked people will not be able to possess or enjoy the benefits and blessing of living in God’s kingdom. They will not be part of that kingdom and God will not reign over them as their king. To <em>inherit</em> something generally means to receive it as a gift from someone who has died. But here there is no thought of someone dying. If the metaphor <em>inherit</em> suggests that someone must die, you may wish to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the wicked will not possess God’s Kingdom (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who do wrong will have no share in the Kingdom of God (NLT1)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the wicked will not enter/receive the kingdom of God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">For the phrase <em>inherit the kingdom of God</em>, see also Matthew 25:34, 1 Corinthians 15:50, Galatians 5:21, and Ephesians 5:5.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the kingdom of God:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the kingdom of God</em> refers to God’s rule over his people. Here Paul was mostly referring to the eternal blessings which God’s people will enjoy in the future. You will probably want to translate <em>kingdom of God</em> here in a way similar to how you translated it in other parts of the NT. See, for example, Luke 14:15, Matthew 8:11–12, and Acts 14:22. Some ways to translate this are:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>As a noun. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s rule/reign</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s kingship</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s chieftaincy</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s government</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a verbal expression:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the way God rules his people</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>6:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Do not be deceived:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Make no mistake.</p></li><li><p>Do not let anyone deceive you.</p></li><li><p>Stop believing lies.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Do not be deceived:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>Do not be deceived</em> can also be translated as “Stop being deceived.” It implies that there were people in the Corinthian church who said that it was all right if believers behaved in sinful ways. Paul wanted the believers to stop believing these lies.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>be deceived:</strong> While the BSB and Greek are passive, in some languages it may be more natural to translate it as active.

It is a general word referring to all who sin by having sexual relations outside of marriage. See the notes on 5:1b and 5:9b</p><h4>6:9d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:9d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>nor idolaters,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and people who worship idols,</p></li><li><p>people who follow/obey other gods,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>idolaters:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>idolaters</em> is the same as in 5:10c.

It is possible that in this context it refers to the active partner in a homosexual relationship, that is, men who treated other males as though they were women.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:9f</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In translating this verse part, it is important to use words or phrases that are suitable for public worship. Consider whether some euphemism may be natural. In some languages it may be natural to combine the two groups into one: “homosexuals.”</p></div>",

At least one of the believers had taken another believer to a pagan/civil court to settle a dispute. Paul told the Corinthian believers that this was unwise and harmful to the church. He taught them what they as believers should do if another believer wronged them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other possible section headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Believers should not go to law before unbelievers</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christians should not sue other Christians in pagan courts</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Advice about lawsuits</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1047006009\" data-endVerseId=\"1047006011\"><h3>Paragraph 6:9–11</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">This paragraph is another basis for Paul’s appeal to the Corinthian believers not to take each other to court. The basis is that the unrighteous will not enter God’s kingdom (verse 9). Some of the Corinthian believers had been very unrighteous in the past, but Paul reminded them that they should now live righteous lives because of what Christ has done for them (verse 11). Therefore they should no longer take each other to court.</p></div><h4>6:11a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:11a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And that is what some of you were.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And this is what some of you used to be.</p></li><li><p>It is true, some of you used to live/behave like that.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>And</em> introduces the concluding part or stage of Paul’s argument. Many English versions do not explicitly translate this conjunction. Consider how in your language it is natural to introduce the next part of Paul’s argument.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that is what some of you were:</strong> This clause indicates that <u>before they became believers in Jesus</u> some of the Corinthian believers used to sin in the ways just mentioned. God had made them his own people, and so now they should behave differently. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Some of you used to be like that. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In the past, some of you were like that. (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>6:11b-d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But:</strong> In the Greek text the word <em>But</em> occurs three times, once in each verse part. This gives emphasis to the contrast with the previous verse part. The NASB follows the structure of the Greek:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified…. (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The BSB translates this word once only, as this is more natural in English. You should consider if it is natural to repeat this word in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified:</strong> These three verbs are all in the past tense. Paul was talking about what happened to the Corinthian believers when they first believed in Jesus. All three verbs are passives. The implied agent in each case is God. He is the one who washed, sanctified, and justified the Corinthians. So there are two ways to translate these verse parts:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>using passive verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your sins have been washed away, and you have been set apart for God. You have been made right with God. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you were washed clean. You were made holy, and you were made right with God (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>using active verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> washed you, sanctified you, and justified you.</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>6:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But you were washed,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But you have been washed/cleansed/purified,</p></li><li><p>But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you are no longer like that</span>. Now God has taken away your sin,</p></li><li><p>But now <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you no longer do those things because</span> God has made you clean on the inside,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you were washed:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>you were washed</em> is a metaphor. It refers to God cleansing a believer from sin.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you have been washed clean (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you have been purified from sin (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has made you pure/clean <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by taking away your sins</span>.</p></blockquote><h4>6:11c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:11c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>you were sanctified,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>you have been made holy/pure,</p></li><li><p>he has made you one of his holy people,</p></li><li><p>and he has caused you to belong completely to himself,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you were sanctified:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>sanctified</em> means “made holy,” or “set apart for God,” that is, made part of God’s own holy people. It is the same word that Paul used in 1:2b. See the note on 1:2b. Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you have been dedicated to God (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You were made holy (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you have been set apart for God (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>6:11d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:11d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>you were justified,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and you have been made/put right with God.</p></li><li><p>and he has made you just/upright/acceptable in his sight.</p></li><li><p>and he has taken away your guilt.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you were justified:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>you were justified</em> means “you were made right.” To justify someone is to declare them not guilty. In this context Paul was saying that God had declared the believers not guilty. God had put them right with himself. See also, for example, Romans 3:24, 3:26, 3:28, 5:1, and Galatians 2:16. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you have been put right with God (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>made…acceptable to God (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>6:11e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:11e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>God did that by means of the Lord Jesus Christ,</p></li><li><p>The Lord Jesus Christ made all that possible.</p></li><li><p>God did this through the Lord Jesus Christ,</p></li></ul></div><h4>6:11f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:11f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and by the Spirit of our God.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he did it</span> by means of his Spirit.</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he did that</span> by sending his Spirit <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to work powerfully in you</span>.</p></li><li><p>and through his Holy Spirit.</p></li></ul></div><h4>6:11e-f</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God:</strong> These two phrases are related to all three verbs in 6:11b-d. That is, God washed us, sanctified us, and justified us, and he did it all <em>in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ:</strong> There are several ways to interpret the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ</em>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Here are some ways that different scholars have suggested to reword 6:11e: “by the power of the Lord Jesus Christ,” “because of our union with the Lord Jesus Christ,” “on the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ,” and “in the domain where the Lord Jesus Christ rules.” See Ellington and Hatton.</span></span> The two main ways to understand this are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>God washed, sanctified, and justified us <u>by means of</u> the Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus was the instrument or agent that God used to save us. For example, this could be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>through the name of the Lord Jesus Christ</p></blockquote></li><li><p>God washed, sanctified, and justified us <u>because of</u> the Lord Jesus Christ. In other words, it was because of what Jesus did for us that God was able to save us. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because of what the Lord Jesus Christ and the Spirit of our God have done for you (NLT)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1), since it has stronger translation and commentary support. Also, interpretation (1) is probably closer to Paul’s meaning, since it fits in better with 6:11f (“by the Spirit of our God”).</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the Lord Jesus Christ:</strong> There is a textual problem here.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some Greek manuscripts say <u>the Lord Jesus Christ</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ (NCV) <em>(BSB, NCV, CEV, NASB, RSV, GNT, NJB, NET, ESV, NLT, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Some Greek manuscripts say <u>the Lord Jesus</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>through the name of the Lord Jesus (REB) <em>(REB, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1), along with the majority of English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>by the Spirit of our God:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>by the Spirit of our God</em> here probably means “you were washed…<u>by means of</u> the Spirit of our God.” God washed, sanctified, and justified us by means of the power of the Holy Spirit.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the Spirit of our God:</strong> This means the Holy Spirit. In some languages it is not normal to say <em>our God</em>. In those languages it is better to translate this phrase some other way, for example: “the God whom we worship.” The entire phrase, <em>the Spirit of our God</em>, can be translated “the Holy Spirit who is from our God,” or “the Spirit whom our God sent/gave to us.”</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:11b-f</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Since God is the implied agent of the verbs in 6:11b-d, you may want to use the phrase “our God” as the subject in 6:11b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>11a</sup>Some of you used to behave in those evil ways. <sup>11b</sup>But our God washed you clean. <sup>11c</sup>He made you his own holy people <sup>11d</sup>and freed you from your sins. <sup>11e</sup>He did all this through the Lord Jesus Christ <sup>11f</sup>and the power of his <span data-bnType=\"implied\">own</span> Spirit.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice in this translation that the words “our God” are in 6:11b, and in 6:11f it says “his <span data-bnType=\"implied\">own</span> Spirit.” The “his” in 6:11f refers back to “our God” in 6:11b rather than to the Lord Jesus Christ. It is in order to make this clear that the word “own” has been supplied.</p></div>",

He had heard that some people in Corinth were behaving immorally. It appears that some of the Christians there were saying that it was all right for them to live as they pleased, because God would save and forgive them. They were saying that it did not matter what they did with their bodies. Paul said that they were wrong. In this section he told them why as believers they should honor God in everything they did.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1047006012\" data-endVerseId=\"1047006017\"><h3>Paragraph 6:12–17</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph Paul wrote that it is wrong for Christians to behave immorally, that is, to disobey God’s laws about sex. It seems some believers in Corinth had misunderstood what Paul had taught them. Paul had taught that a believer does not have to obey Jewish rules and rituals in order to become acceptable to God. But the Corinthians thought that since Christians do not have to keep the Jewish law, they could do whatever they wanted. Paul said that immoral behavior is wrong because our bodies belong to the Lord and he sent his Spirit to live in our bodies.</p></div><h4>6:12a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:12a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Everything is permissible for me,”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Someone has said:</span> “I am permitted to do anything.”</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">It has been said:</span> “I am allowed to do whatever I want.”</p></li><li><p>¶ Some of you like to quote this teaching/saying: “We<sup>(incl)</sup> can do/be anything we choose.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Everything is permissible for me:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>Everything is permissible for me</em> is more literally “everything is allowed to me,” that is, nothing is forbidden or against the law. The speaker was claiming that he or she was permitted to do anything. In most English versions these words are put in quote marks. These quote marks are not in the Greek text, and the KJV, NASB, and JBP do not include them. It is not clear whether Paul was quoting his own teaching or what someone else had said. Perhaps the people in Corinth wrote these words to Paul in a letter they sent to him. Or perhaps Paul had heard that some people in Corinth had said this. In your translation, you may need to supply a speaker as subject. Try to make this as general as possible. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Someone will say, “I am allowed to do anything.” (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Some of you say,</span> “Everything is permissible for me.”</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“I am free to do anything,” you say. (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here the first-person pronoun “I” (<em>me</em> in the BSB) refers to any Christian, so in some languages it will be clearer to say “we” or “we believers.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Some of you say, “We can do anything we want to.” (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>6:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but not everything is beneficial.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Some things, however, are not useful/helpful.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Well, yes.</span> But that does not mean that everything is good/helpful <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for you/us</span><sup>(incl)</sup>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">In one sense that may be true,</span> but some things have no value/profit/advantage.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but not everything is beneficial:</strong> These words are Paul’s own words. They are not part of the quotation. Paul was indicating that the truth of the saying in 6:12a was limited or partial. It is true that Christians do not have to keep the ceremonial laws that God gave to the Jewish people. But this is not an excuse to sin.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In Romans 6:1 and 6:15, Paul wrote something that is similar to what he wrote here in 1 Corinthians 6:12: “Shall we continue in sin so that grace may increase?” (Romans 6:1) and “Shall we sin because we are not under law, but under grace?” (Romans 6:15). Paul said that God saves us because of his grace, that is, he saves us freely, because he wants to. We do not have to earn or buy salvation by keeping laws. So some people wanted to know “Since God graciously forgives our sins and because we don’t have to keep any laws to be saved, does that mean that we can keep on sinning?” In both Romans 6:2 and 6:15 Paul answers this question “Certainly not!” This is the same expression that the BSB translates “Never!” in 1 Corinthians 6:15b.</span></span> Consider how it is natural in your language to accept a saying with caution or hesitation and to introduce limits to its meaning or application. Some ways to do this in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Yes, but… (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Be that as it may…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Granted, but…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>not everything is beneficial:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>beneficial</em> can also be translated as “helpful.” Paul did not say whether he meant helpful to oneself or to others. He may well have been thinking of both things, and it is recommended that you translate this in a general way, as do most English versions. The context suggests that Paul was probably thinking primarily of one’s own spiritual benefit. So if you cannot keep this general, you may wish to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not everything is good for you (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not everything is good for us (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>6:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Everything is permissible for me,”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“I am permitted to do anything,” yes,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Someone has said:</span> “I am allowed to do whatever I want,”</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You say that</span> we<sup>(incl)</sup> are free to do anything we want/choose to do,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Everything is permissible for me:</strong> These are the same words as in 6:12a. Paul repeated this saying or quotation here. Some English versions do not put the words in quote marks this second time. If it is unnatural in your language to repeat the quotation exactly, you may be able to follow one of these models:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>True, for me everything is permissible. (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No doubt I am free to do anything. (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I could say that I am allowed to do anything. (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>6:12d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:12d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but I will not be mastered by anything.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but I will not let anything be my boss/master.</p></li><li><p>but I will not become a slave to anything.</p></li><li><p>but I refuse to allow anything to control me.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but I will not be mastered by anything:</strong> This is a response to the quotation in 6:12c. The pronoun <em>I</em> in this sentence probably refers to Paul himself. He was indicating that while in one sense it was true that he was permitted to do anything, he chose not to do everything. He did not want to do anything that would control him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I will not be mastered by anything:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>I will not be mastered</em> here indicates Paul’s determination not to allow anything to have control of his life. He refused to let this happen. This is a passive clause. There are two ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will not be controlled by anything. (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>using an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I must not become a slave to anything. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I won’t allow anything to gain control over my life. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I refuse to let anything have power over me.

Paul said that immoral behavior is wrong because our bodies belong to the Lord and he sent his Spirit to live in our bodies.</p></div><h4>6:13a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:13a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Food for the stomach and the stomach for food,”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Some are saying:</span> “Things to eat exist <span data-bnType=\"implied\">only</span> for the stomach. And the stomach exists <span data-bnType=\"implied\">only</span> for the foods we<sup>(incl)</sup> eat.”</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">But maybe someone will say:</span> “<span data-bnType=\"implied\">God made</span> food for our stomachs, and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he made</span> our<sup>(incl)</sup> stomachs to desire food.”</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Some of you say,</span> “Our<sup>(incl)</sup> bodies want food, and food is there for us to eat.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Food for the stomach and the stomach for food:</strong> These words are in quote marks in the BSB. However, some English versions do not use quotation marks here. The two interpretations are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>This is a quotation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Someone else will say, “Food is for the stomach, and the stomach is for food.” (GNT) <em>(BSB, NIV, NET, GNT, RSV, NLT, REB, ESV, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>This is a simple statement, not a quotation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Foods are for the stomach, and the stomach is for foods. (NJB) <em>(NJB, KJV, NASB, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), along with the majority of English versions. Some people may have used this saying to argue that sexual intercourse outside of marriage is not wrong. They meant: “Eating is just a physical activity. We do it because our body desires food. Sex is the same way: it is just physical, and we do it because our body desires it. It is not sinful.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In many languages it may be natural to supply verbs in this verse part. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food. (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Food was meant for the stomach and the stomach for food. (JBP)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the stomach:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>stomach</em> refers to the inner parts of the body that digest food. It includes both the stomach and the intestines. Since it refers to any and every human stomach, in some languages it may be natural to use the plural: “stomachs.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here Paul used this word to stand for our body’s need for food. In some languages it is more natural to translate this verse without using the word for <em>stomach</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Food <span data-bnType=\"implied\">is good</span> for our bodies, and our bodies <span data-bnType=\"implied\">need</span> food.</p></blockquote><h4>6:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but God will destroy them both.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">But I say:</span> but one day God will do away with both stomachs and food.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">My answer to that is this:</span> I agree, but in the future he will change things so that we<sup>(incl)</sup> will not have stomachs and we will not need food.</p></li><li><p>Granted, and/but <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the future life</span> God will bring an end to these stomachs and their food.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but God will destroy them both:</strong> Paul agreed with the statement in 6:13a, but he wanted to correct or limit the way the Corinthians applied it. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>True, and one day God will put an end to both. (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul did not say whether he was thinking of the time when we will die or the time when God will give us new bodies. Try to translate this in a general way. In the future God will bring to an end our present way of life. Then we will no longer need food or our stomach.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>destroy:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>destroy</em> means to abolish or set something aside. Paul knew that God will abolish our present earthly bodies that need food. He will change our bodies (1 Corinthians 15:51–53; Philippians 3:21). The new body God will give us will not need food as our earthly bodies do.</p><h4>6:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The body is not intended for sexual immorality,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Our<sup>(incl)</sup> bodies are not made/intended for sexual sin</p></li><li><p>God did not make our<sup>(incl)</sup> bodies so we can behave in immoral/promiscuous ways.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">But</span> it is wrong to use our<sup>(incl)</sup> body/bodies to have sex with someone we are not married to.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek this sentence begins with a connecting word that is often translated as “but” (as in the NJB). In this context it introduces the contrast between what Paul had said before and what he is going to say now. The stomach is made for food but the body is not meant for sexual immorality. Introduce this sentence in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The body is not intended for sexual immorality:</strong> This clause part indicates that God did not make the human physical body so that people could behave immorally. That is not its purpose. Since Paul was referring to any and every human body, in some languages it may be more natural to use the plural. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But our bodies were not made for sexual immorality. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We are not supposed to do indecent things with our bodies. (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>6:13d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:13d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but for the Lord,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but for <span data-bnType=\"implied\">serving</span> the Lord,</p></li><li><p>Rather, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God made our</span><sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">bodies to serve</span> the Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus</span>,</p></li><li><p>No, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we should use our</span><sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">body to work</span> for the Lord</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but for the Lord:</strong> These words are not a complete sentence. In your translation you may need to make this a complete sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the body is meant/made</span> for the Lord.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul probably meant that God made our bodies so that we could serve the Lord Jesus. We can honor and serve the Lord with our physical human bodies here on earth. After the Lord returns, we will be able to honor and serve him with the new bodies he will give us. Compare 1 Corinthians 15:50–54.</p><h4>6:13e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:13e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and the Lord for the body.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and the Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">is concerned</span> for our<sup>(incl)</sup> bodies.</p></li><li><p>and the Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">cares about</span> our<sup>(incl)</sup> bodies.</p></li><li><p>as the Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">works to help</span> our<sup>(incl)</sup> body.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Lord for the body:</strong> This also is not a complete sentence. The Lord is <em>for</em> the body in the sense that he cares about our physical bodies and provides for them. One day he will raise them from the dead. If you need to translate this as a complete sentence, you may be able to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Lord provides for the body (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Lord cares about our bodies (NLT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:14c-e</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek these verse parts do not have any explicit verbs. There are various verbs that can be supplied in one or more of the verse parts.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some English versions that use different verbs:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But the body is not for fornication; it is for the Lord—and the Lord is for the body. (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We are not supposed to do indecent things with our bodies. We are to use them for the Lord who is in charge of our bodies.

Paul used this question to remind the believers of an important teaching they had forgotten or were ignoring. There are two ways to translate this verse part:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>as a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do I need to remind you that your bodies are members of Christ?</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Surely you know that your bodies are parts of Christ himself. (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">You should translate this verse part in a way that is natural for reminding people of something they seemed to have forgotten.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your bodies are members of Christ:</strong> This is a metaphor. The picture is that of various body parts together forming Christ’s body. This illustrates how believers are united with Christ. Not just our soul (inner being) is joined to Christ, but our whole person, including our body, belongs to Christ. Other ways of translating this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>your bodies are part of the body of Christ (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>your bodies are limbs and organs of Christ (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>your bodies:</strong> In the Greek culture of Paul’s time, people thought that the inner part of a person, his spirit, went on living somewhere after he died, but that a person’s body finished and came to nothing. They thought that there was no resurrection of the body (compare Matthew 22:23). Paul used the metaphor about being members of Christ to show that a believer’s body is significant. A believer must not use his body to do anything sinful. A believer is responsible to Christ for what he does with his body.</p><h4>6:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute?

I should never think of such a thing!</p></li><li><p>Since our bodies are joined to Christ, it is unthinkable that we should unite them to prostitutes!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute?:</strong> This is also a rhetorical question. Paul himself went on to provide the question to this question: “Never!” There are two ways of translating this verse part:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>as a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Should I take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is not right/proper for me to take my body and join it to a prostitute’s body.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So I must never take the parts of Christ and join them to a prostitute! (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this in a way that is strong/emphatic to show Paul’s strong emotion.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Shall I then take:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>Shall I…take</em> here means “Should I…take.” Paul means that he should not do this, and nor should anyone else. This is a general principle. What Paul said here is true of anyone who is a believer. In some languages it may be better to use a different subject, such as “we” or “any Christian.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Should we<sup>(incl)</sup> take…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Should a believer take…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>take</em> means “to remove, take away.” Paul was saying that when a believer has sex with a prostitute, it is as though he has taken his body away from Christ and joined it to a prostitute instead. A person cannot be joined together with Christ and with a prostitute at the same time. It is either one or the other.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the members of Christ:</strong> When Paul says <em>members of Christ</em> here, he is referring to the bodies of believers. In some languages it may be helpful to make this explicit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">our</span> <sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">bodies,</span> which are united to Christ,</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>prostitute:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>prostitute</em> refers to a woman who makes a living by having sex with various men she is not married to. Be careful to use a word that is polite enough that people can read your translation aloud in church without being embarrassed. If in your language and culture there is no word for <em>prostitute</em>, you may need to substitute a more general term for an immoral woman.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In 6:15b and 6:16a Paul was talking primarily to the Christian <u>men</u> in Corinth. He said it was wrong for a Christian man to have sex with a prostitute. He did not say anything about what is right or wrong for Christian women. But what Paul said about sexual immorality (6:13c, 6:18a), about our bodies belonging to the Lord (6:13d-e, 6:15a), and about our bodies being a temple of the Holy Spirit (6:19–20), is true of both men and women believers.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Never!:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>Never!</em> is very strong. It means “May it never be!” or “Don’t even think of such a thing!” Other ways to translate it include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>That’s unthinkable! (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Out of the question! (NJB)</p></blockquote>",

He had heard that some people in Corinth were behaving immorally. It appears that some of the Christians there were saying that it was all right for them to live as they pleased, because God would save and forgive them.

It seems some believers in Corinth had misunderstood what Paul had taught them. Paul had taught that a believer does not have to obey Jewish rules and rituals in order to become acceptable to God. But the Corinthians thought that since Christians do not have to keep the Jewish law, they could do whatever they wanted. Paul said that immoral behavior is wrong because our bodies belong to the Lord and he sent his Spirit to live in our bodies.</p></div><h4>6:17</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:17\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with Him in spirit.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But whoever has united himself to the Lord is one with him in his spirit.</p></li><li><p>But when someone joins himself to the Lord, his spirit and the Lord’s Spirit become one.</p></li><li><p>But people who believe in the Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus</span> are united/connected to the Lord in their hearts/spirits.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he who unites himself with the Lord is one with Him in spirit:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>unites himself</em> is the same word as in 6:16a and again means “associates oneself in a very close way.” Paul was comparing and contrasting a believer’s sexual union with a prostitute, and his spiritual union with Christ.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>16b</sup>It is written in the Scriptures, <sup>16c</sup>“The two will become one body.” <sup>16a</sup>So you should know that anyone who joins with a prostitute becomes one body with the prostitute. <sup>17</sup>But the one who joins with the Lord is one spirit with the Lord.

Then he gave more reasons for this command: A person ruins his body as the Holy Spirit’s living place if he takes part in sexual immorality. God bought our bodies by paying a big price for them. So our bodies belong to him, and we must honor him by using our bodies in right ways.</p></div><h4>6:18a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:18a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Flee from sexual immorality.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Be very careful that you do not behave immorally.</p></li><li><p>¶ Have nothing at all to do with sexually bad ways.</p></li><li><p>¶ Absolutely do not have sex with anyone except your spouse.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Flee from sexual immorality:</strong> This is a strongly worded command. Paul told them to avoid all connection with sexually bad behavior. The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>sexual immorality</em> is the same word as in 5:1b. See the note there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Flee:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Flee</em> is a figure of speech. To <em>Flee</em> means to run away from something or someone. Paul was not commanding the Corinthian believers to literally run away. Rather, he was saying “Be very, very careful not to commit sexual sin.” There are two ways to translate this figure of speech:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>literally, keeping the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>run away from sexual sin (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>remove the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Don’t be immoral in matters of sex. (CEV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Try to retain the figure of speech if this makes the command more emphatic or memorable. If necessary you may substitute a slightly different figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Avoid immorality like the plague!</p></blockquote><h4>6:18b-c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul now gave a reason for his strong command in 6:18a. He explained that there was a difference between sexual wrongdoing and other kinds of wrongdoing. Other wrongdoings may harm the body, but they do not cause the believer’s body to become one with someone outside of God’s will. Sexual wrongdoing harms the believer in a way no other wrongdoing does.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This is a general principle. It is true of everyone. In this context Paul was specifically thinking of “a man” who might visit a prostitute, but his main point applies to women as well as to men. It is therefore possible to translate this using a different subject. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Other sins that people commit don’t affect their bodies the same way that sexual sins do. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Every sin that a person commits is outside the body, but the fornicator sins against the body itself. (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">See the General Comment on 6:18b-c for other ways to structure this sentence.</p><h4>6:18b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:18b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Every other sin a man can commit is outside his body,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Other kinds of sins are not sins against one’s own body <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the same way</span>.</p></li><li><p>When people sin, they usually do not sin against their own bodies.</p></li><li><p>All the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other</span> sins that people do are not sins that affect/harm their own bodies in the way</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Every other sin a man can commit is outside his body:</strong> The BSB, like most English versions, supplies the word <em>other</em>. It is not explicit in the Greek text. Paul was indicating that other sins were different from sexual sins in that they do not affect or involve the body in the same way. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>All other sins that people may commit are done outside the body. (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Every other sin people do is outside their bodies. (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>6:18c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:18c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but he who sins sexually sins against his own body.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But when people have sex with people they are not married to, they sin against their own body.</p></li><li><p>But people who behave in sexually bad ways are wronging their own bodies.</p></li><li><p>that having sex with someone they are not married to harms them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he who sins sexually sins against his own body:</strong> When a believer gives his body to become one with a prostitute, he ruins himself both morally (by breaking God’s laws) and spiritually (by greatly harming his union with Christ).

He has chosen to disobey God’s laws about what is right and what is wrong.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:18b-c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">There are several ways to combine the information and show the contrast in these verse parts.

He was trying to get them to think in good and right ways.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit:</strong> This is a metaphor. A <em>temple</em> is a building that people make for their God or gods to live in. Here Paul was indicating that the Holy Spirit lives within the individual believer. Compare notes on 3:16a and 3:16b, where Paul talked about the church as a group. Different ways to translate this include:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>as a metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your body is like a temple for the Holy Spirit</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Explaining something of the meaning of the figure of speech.

This phrase helps to explain the meaning of the previous verse part. This is the sense in which the body is a temple of the Holy Spirit.</p><h4>6:19c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:19c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>whom you have received from God?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>God himself gave you the Holy Spirit.</p></li><li><p>God sent him to live/dwell in you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>whom you have received from God:</strong> This verse part indicates that the Holy Spirit is a gift that God gives to believers. In some languages it may be natural to translate this with God as the agent. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whom God has given to you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Another possible way to translate this is to follow the REB:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Spirit is God’s gift to you (REB)</p></blockquote><h4>6:19d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:19d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>You are not your own;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You do not belong to yourselves.</p></li><li><p>You are not your own lord/master.</p></li><li><p>He/God owns you.

(GNT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:19a-d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek text 6:19a-d forms one long rhetorical question.

When a man bought a slave, he became the owner of the slave. The slave was obliged to obey his new master. In a similar way a believer does not belong to himself. He or she now belongs to God, and God may command him or her to live for him just as he chooses. The verb <em>you were bought</em> is in the passive. So there are two ways to translate this clause:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>using a passive verb. It is possible to supply the agent (God).

There are no longer any copies of this letter, so we can only guess what they wrote by reading Paul’s answers. Apparently some of the questions the Corinthians had asked were about marriage and sex. In this section Paul discussed these topics. He wrote about sexual intercourse, divorce, marrying again after a person’s husband or wife dies, and never marrying.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">From the way Paul talked, it appears that the Corinthians were thinking that if believers want to be holy, they should abstain from sexual relations. The Corinthians were wondering if married people should sleep together, if Christians who were married to non-Christians should divorce them, and if Christians should get married. Paul gave them some wise teaching on each of these topics. In 7:1–16 he addressed Christians who were married. In 7:17–24 he wrote about his general rule for Christians: Remain as you are. In 7:25–38 he taught Christians who were not married. In 7:39–40 he addressed women whose husbands had died.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other possible section headings include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul gave/wrote instructions about Christian marriage</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s teaching on marriage</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1047007001\" data-endVerseId=\"1047007007\"><h3>Paragraph 7:1–7</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul began to discuss the subjects the Corinthians had written to him about. It seems that some believers were thinking that sexual intercourse was not good. Those people even said that married Christians should not have sexual intercourse with each other. Paul said that it was good for married believers to live together normally as man and wife. This would help them avoid being tempted to commit sex sins.</p></div><h4>7:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Now for the matters you wrote about:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Now I will address/discuss the things you wrote to me about.</p></li><li><p>¶ Now about/concerning the contents of your letter:</p></li><li><p>¶ And now let us<sup>(incl)</sup> discuss what you wrote to me.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Now for the matters you wrote about:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>Now for</em> can also be translated as “Now concerning.” This phrase introduces a new topic. Paul was about to begin to discuss a letter that the Corinthian believers had written to Paul. Another way to translate this verse part is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now I will discuss the things you wrote me about. (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>7:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>It is good to abstain from sexual relations.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You wrote/write,</span> “It is good for a man to refrain from relations with a woman”</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You say/said,</span> “It is better for a man not to have sex with a woman.”</p></li><li><p>You asked me if it was better for <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christian</span> men to remain celibate.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>It is good to abstain from sexual relations:</strong> Scholars disagree as to whether these are Paul’s own words or whether he was quoting from the Corinthians’ letter. The two views are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>This is a quotation. The Corinthians had asked Paul if he agreed with them concerning this matter. Paul was referring back to what they had said. For example, the NRSV shows this by putting the words in quotation marks:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“It is well for a man not to touch a woman.” (NRSV) <em>(ESV, NJB, NET, NLT, NRSV, REB, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>These are Paul’s own words. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is well for a man not to touch a woman. (RSV) <em>(BSB, RSV, GNT, KJV, NASB, GW, NCV, NIV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). These words were probably a Corinthian saying or slogan that they had written in their letter to Paul. The Display text meaning lines show that these are some of the words from the Corinthians’ letter.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Here are some reasons why it is best to interpret 7:1b as a quote from the Corinthians’ letter: (1) In other parts of 1 Corinthians Paul quoted what the Corinthians said; for example: 6:12, 6:13; and 10:23. (2) In 1 Timothy 4:3, Paul talked about some false teachers who were forbidding people to get married; Paul did not agree with their teaching. (3) Paul was a Jew; the Jewish people as a whole thought that marriage was good (following Genesis 2:18).</span></span> If you use quotation marks in your language, it is good to use them here. However, quotation marks alone will not help the listener. So it is good to also use a phrase such as “You say” or “You wrote” so that the listener will understand that these words are not Paul’s own teaching.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>It is good:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>good</em> here probably means useful, beneficial, or helpful. The saying implies that the Corinthians thought it was better for Christian men, even those who were married, not to have any intimate relations with women. They believed that this would make them more holy.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to abstain from sexual relations:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>to abstain from sexual relations</em> is literally “not to touch a woman.” This is a euphemism. (A euphemism is the use of a polite or indirect expression in place of an expression that might offend.) There are two views about the meaning of this euphemism.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to sexual intercourse in general. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman. (ESV) <em>(BSB, ESV, NET, NLT, REB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to marriage. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A man does well not to marry. (GNT) <em>(NIV, GNT, GW, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because Paul would not have needed to use a euphemism to speak about marriage. In his culture it was acceptable to speak openly about marriage. But it was common to use euphemisms when talking about sex.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Consider whether it is good to use a euphemism here in your translation. Consider carefully which euphemism might be appropriate. Do not use the euphemism “touch” if your readers will understand it literally as referring to any form of touching.</p>",

So I say that</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">My answer is:</span> Many people behave immorally.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>But</em> here introduces a limit or qualification to the previous verse part. Paul implied that he only partly agreed with the Corinthians that celibacy was good. He did not believe that everyone should live that way, and certainly he did not believe that married people should live that way. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Rather (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Yes, but (see the NLT, and the NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because there is so much sexual immorality:</strong> In Greek the word that the BSB translates as <em>sexual immorality</em> is in the plural. So this clause can be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>since there are so many cases of sexual immorality (see 7:2 in the NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to translate <em>sexual immorality</em> as a verb phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>since so many people commit sex sins</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul meant that sexual immorality was common in the city of Corinth.</p><h4>7:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>each man should have his own wife,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>each man should keep/hold to his own wife,</p></li><li><p>you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">married</span> men should all have relations with your own wife,</p></li><li><p>For that reason, each of you married men are to live in a normal/intimate way with your own wife,</p></li></ul></div><h4>7:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and each woman her own husband.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and each woman should keep/hold to her husband.</p></li><li><p>and all you women <span data-bnType=\"implied\">should have relations with</span> your husband.</p></li><li><p>and each woman must do the same with her husband.</p></li></ul></div><h4>7:2b-c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband:</strong> These are commands. This is what Paul wanted the believers to do. He wanted each of them to <em>have</em> their own spouse. This would help them avoid the temptation to immorality.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek phrases that the BSB translates literally as <em>have his own wife</em> and “have her own husband” are idioms. There are two ways to understand the meaning of these idioms:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>They mean to have sexual relations with one’s spouse. For example, the NET footnote says that the word <em>have</em> means “have marital relations with.”</p></li><li><p>They mean to get married. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>every one, both men and women, should be married</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This is the view of several commentaries, and it fits the context well. Paul quoted the Corinthian saying that it was good to avoid sex, but then said that he wanted married people to have sexual relations with their spouses. Paul used a euphemism here in order to avoid talking directly about sex. There is no reason he would have avoided talking directly about getting married.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In your translation, use a euphemism if that is natural and appropriate in your language. An example of an English euphemism is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you married men should <u>sleep with</u> your wives, and you wives with your husbands</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>each man…each woman:</strong> In some languages there may be different words for married and unmarried men and women (as in older English the word <em>woman</em> referred to a married woman, in contrast to a “maid”). If this is the case in your language, you should use words that refer specifically to married adults. In some languages it may be natural to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all men…all women</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>every man…every woman</p></blockquote>",

It seems that some believers were thinking that sexual intercourse was not good. Those people even said that married Christians should not have sexual intercourse with each other. Paul said that it was good for married believers to live together normally as man and wife. This would help them avoid being tempted to commit sex sins.</p></div><h4>7:5a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:5a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Do not deprive each other,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">To you married people I say:</span> Stop refusing to fulfill your duty to one another.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">So now I command you married people</span> to stop denying your spouse his or her marriage rights.</p></li><li><p>Do not say to your spouse, “I will not sleep with you.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Do not deprive each other:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>deprive</em> here means to keep back from someone something that belongs to him or her. It means to prevent someone from having and enjoying what rightfully belongs to him or her. In this context it refers to someone refusing to have sexual relations with his or her spouse. In some languages it may be natural to translate this as direct speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not say to your spouse, “I will no longer have sex with you.”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Do not deprive:</strong> In Greek this is in the present tense. This probably indicates that when Paul wrote 1 Corinthians, some married Christians in Corinth were not having sex with their husbands or wives. So you can translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Stop depriving each other.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Stop refusing to give your spouse his marriage rights.</p></blockquote><h4>7:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>except by mutual consent and for a time,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The only exception <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to normal relations</span> should be when you have both agreed to stay apart from each other for a little while</p></li><li><p>However, it is all right if you decide together that you will not be intimate for a short time</p></li><li><p>You may perhaps both agree not to sleep together for a little while</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>except by mutual consent and for a time:</strong> Paul was allowing some exceptions to what he had just said. He accepted that sometimes husbands and wives might not have sexual relations.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>by mutual consent:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>by mutual consent</em> can also be translated as “by agreement.” It indicates that the husband and wife must both wish to stay apart from one another. They must agree to refrain from sexual relations.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for a time:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>for a time</em> means “for a short time” or “for a little while.” The husband and wife should not stay apart for very long.</p><h4>7:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so you may devote yourselves to prayer.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that you will be able to use your time for praying.</p></li><li><p>so that you can spend your time praying.</p></li><li><p>so you will have more/extra time to pray.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so you may devote yourselves to prayer:</strong> This is a purpose clause. It indicates the purpose for which a husband and wife might refrain from sexual relations for a while. Among the Jewish people in the OT and among the Christians in the NT, it was a custom to pray and fast for several days at a time. During these times it was common for husbands and wives to refrain from sexual relations. (See for example Exodus 19:15.)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The KJV translates 7:5c this way: “that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer.” Many Greek copies of 1 Corinthians have the words “fasting and prayer” in 7:5c, instead of just the word “prayer.” But the UBS Greek text does not include the words “fasting and,” because these words are not in the oldest Greek copies of 1 Corinthians. It gives the shorter version an A rating, indicating that the words “fasting and” were almost certainly not in the original text of 1 Corinthians. Almost all English versions follow the UBS Greek text. It is recommended that you do not include the words “fasting and.”</span></span> Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in order to spend your time in prayer (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to leave yourselves free for prayer (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>devote yourselves:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>devote yourselves</em> means to focus on something strongly.

Paul gave his command not to “deprive each other” <em>so that</em> believers would <em>not</em> be tempted by Satan. He knew that when married people do not have sexual intercourse, they give Satan a chance to tempt them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Satan:</strong> <em>Satan</em> is a name for the devil, the chief of the evil angels. See the note on 5:5a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>tempt you:</strong> If you need to say what the Corinthians might be tempted to do, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>tempt you to sin</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>tempt you to commit adultery</p></blockquote><h4>7:5f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:5f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>through your lack of self-control.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For it is hard for you keep control of yourselves.</p></li><li><p>since you may not be able to control your own desires/passions.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>through your lack of self-control:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>lack of self-control</em> means that a person is not able to control himself.

Many modern commentators believe that Paul was here referring back to what he had just said in 7:5b, that married couples could abstain from normal relations. He allowed them to abstain for a short while if they both agreed and wanted to pray. But he was not commanding them to abstain. They did not need to refrain from normal relations in order to be able to pray. In some languages it may be necessary to make some of this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I say this to give you permission to stay away from sexual relations for a time. It is not a command to do so.

He wrote about sexual intercourse, divorce, marrying again after a person’s husband or wife dies, and never marrying.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">From the way Paul talked, it appears that the Corinthians were thinking that if believers want to be holy, they should abstain from sexual relations. The Corinthians were wondering if married people should sleep together, if Christians who were married to non-Christians should divorce them, and if Christians should get married. Paul gave them some wise teaching on each of these topics. In 7:1–16 he addressed Christians who were married. In 7:17–24 he wrote about his general rule for Christians: Remain as you are. In 7:25–38 he taught Christians who were not married. In 7:39–40 he addressed women whose husbands had died.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other possible section headings include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul gave/wrote instructions about Christian marriage</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s teaching on marriage</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1047007008\" data-endVerseId=\"1047007009\"><h3>Paragraph 7:8–9</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph Paul discussed people who were not married at that time. Some Corinthian believers thought it would be better for them to remain unmarried. Paul advised them to remain as they were. However, if they strongly desired to marry, then they should do so.</p></div><h4>7:9a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:9a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But if they cannot control themselves,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>However, if they/you are not controlling their/your desires/passions,</p></li><li><p>But if a celibate life is too hard for you,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>But</em> here introduces an exception to what Paul had just said. Although he thought it good for people to remain single, he understood that for some people it was not good, and these people should marry.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if they cannot control themselves:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>if they cannot control themselves</em> refers to a situation in which single or widowed people strongly desire to have sexual intercourse. Perhaps they cannot stop this desire or they cannot control their thoughts. If a literal translation does not make this meaning clear, you may be able to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if their desires are so strong they cannot control them</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Again, in some languages it may be natural to use a second-person pronoun. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But if you cannot restrain your desires (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>7:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>let them marry.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>then it is better for them/you to have a wife or a husband.</p></li><li><p>then you ought to marry someone,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>let them marry:</strong> This is Paul’s direction to these people. It is also possible to translate it as a direct command in either the third or second person:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they are to get married</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>go ahead and marry (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>7:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For it is better to marry than to burn with passion.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For it is better for them/you to get married than to stay single and always be longing for marriage/relations.</p></li><li><p>because marriage is preferable to unsatisfied desire.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>For</em> introduces the basis for Paul advising that those people should marry. Translate this in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it is better to marry than to burn with passion:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>burn with passion</em> is literally simply <em>burn</em>. This is a figure of speech that refers to having unsatisfied desires/wants, especially strong unsatisfied sexual desire. So the BSB and most other versions add the implied information <em>with passion</em> to show that Paul was referring to sexual desire.</p>",

Paul had first preached the gospel in Corinth only three or four years before he wrote this letter. So most believers in Corinth had only been believers for a few years. Some men had become believers but their wives had not. And some women had become believers but their husbands had not.

(NCV)</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>For</em> here introduces a reason why believers should not leave their husbands or wives who were not believers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his believing wife:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>is sanctified</em> means to be made holy or set apart to belong to God. See the notes on 1:2b and 1:2c. Paul was saying that the husband of the believer was set apart by his marriage and in some way made holy or acceptable to God.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In 1 Timothy 4:5, Paul said that food “is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.” The Greek word that Paul used for “sanctified” is the same Greek word that is translated “sanctified” in 1 Corinthians 7:14. In 1 Timothy 4:5 Paul meant that the food is not unclean, and therefore it is fit/proper for us to eat. In Romans 11:16 Paul said, “If the root is holy, so are the branches.” By this he meant that if the ancestors of the Jewish people (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob) belonged to God, all the Jewish people belong to God. But yet not all Jewish people are saved. These two verses show us that someone can be said to be “sanctified” or “holy” in one sense and yet not be saved.</span></span> Therefore the marriage was not impure, and the believing wife was not to separate from him. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the unbelieving husband is made acceptable to God by being united to his wife (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The husband who is not a believer is made holy through his believing wife. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul did not mean that the unbeliever was saved or that his or her sins are forgiven because he or she was married to a believer. But he did mean that the Lord sees the unbelieving partner and the marriage as acceptable or holy.</p><h4>7:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her believing husband.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And the wife belongs to the Lord because of you, her Christian husband.</p></li><li><p>And the wife who is not a believer is made holy through her believing husband. (NCV)</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her believing husband:</strong> The text that the BSB has translated as <em>her believing husband</em> is literally “the brother.” This refers to a believing man, a Christian. The man was not his wife’s brother in either a literal or a spiritual sense. Most English versions do not use the word “brother” here. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the unbelieving wife is made acceptable to God by being united to her Christian husband (GNT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 7:14a-b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to combine rather than repeat the information in these 7:14a-b.

(CEV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>7:14c-d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy:</strong> These verse parts explain Paul’s reason for saying that the unbeliever was sanctified by his or her believing spouse. If it were not true, the children of the marriage would be unclean. But Paul and his readers assumed that the children were not unclean. So, he argued, it must be true that in some way the unbelieving partner was made holy through his or her believing spouse and, because of that, the children are considered holy.</p><h4>7:14c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:14c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Otherwise your children would be unclean,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>If it were not so, then your children would not belong to God.</p></li><li><p>If that were not true, then their children would be like the children of parents who are not Christians.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Otherwise:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>Otherwise</em> here means “If this were not so” (GNT); that is, if the unbelieving spouse were not in some way made holy.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>your children:</strong> The phrase <em>your children</em> refers to the children born from the marriage between the believer and the unbeliever. In some languages it may be natural to use a third-person pronoun to match the previous verse, after the model of the GNT:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>their children (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul was saying that if one parent is a believer, the children in some way belong to God. Paul wanted the Corinthians to see that as an important reason for remaining married to their unbelieving husbands and wives.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>unclean:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>unclean</em> is a word used for people or things that were, for various reasons, ceremonially impure. They were not acceptable to God and could not be used for serving him. This word does not imply sinfulness, but it does imply something that is not sacred; in this context, outside the community of God’s believing people. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>like pagan children (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they would not belong to God</p></blockquote><h4>7:14d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:14d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but now they are holy.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But because both you and your unbelieving husband or wife belong to God, your children belong to God too.</p></li><li><p>But because one parent belongs to God, God cares for the children as belonging to himself also.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but now:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>but now</em> here introduces the actual state of affairs.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they are holy:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>holy</em> in this context is the opposite of the word “unclean” in the previous verse part. The word <em>holy</em> comes from the same root word as “sanctify” (see the note on 1:2c). Someone who is <em>holy</em> is someone who belongs to God. So Paul was saying that the children of mixed marriages belong to God. They can be considered part of the community of God’s people and under God’s special care. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they are acceptable to God (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they are actually consecrated to God (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they belong to God</p></blockquote>",

He told the believer to allow the unbeliever to leave if that was what the unbeliever wanted to do.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>leaves:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>leaves</em> means “separates himself” and is the same word used in 7:10c and 11a. See the note on 7:10c. This word should have the same meaning here as it did in 7:10c-11a. This probably refers to a situation in which the unbeliever divorces the believer.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>let him go:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>let him go</em> is literally “let him/her separate.” Paul was saying that the believer should accept the situation. He should allow the unbeliever to separate/leave.</p><h4>7:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The believing brother or sister is not bound in such cases.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>In a case like this, a Christian man or woman is not obliged <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to remain with their spouse</span>.</p></li><li><p>When that happens, the believer is free from the marriage.</p></li><li><p>In this case/situation the believer does not have to stay married to the unbelieving spouse.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The believing brother or sister is not bound in such cases:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>The believing brother or sister</em> is literally “The brother or the sister.” It refers to men and women within the believing community. The word that the BSB translates as <em>is not bound</em> can also be translated as “is not enslaved.” In this context it is used as a figure of speech. It indicates that the believing partner is not obligated to stay with an unbelieving spouse who wants to separate. God does not require the believer to live with the unbeliever if the unbeliever is the one who decides to leave the believer. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When this happens, the Christian man or woman is free. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You are no longer bound to that person.

The BSB does not translate it here. Whether and how you translate it will depend on your interpretation of the verse. See the following note. Connect this verse part to the previous verse part in a way that is natural for the flow of thought.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God has called you to live in peace:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>God has called you to live in peace</em> is literally “In peace God has called you/us.” The word translated as <em>called</em> means “invited, summoned, chosen.” See the notes on 1:1a, 1:2c, and 1:9, where the same word appears. God has chosen/invited us to be his people, part of his family, and he wants his people to live in peace. In some languages it may be necessary to make some of this implicit information clear in the translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God chose you and wants you to live in peace. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">There are two ways to interpret this verse part:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It explains why Christians should not separate from their unbelieving spouses. It means “But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">if possible, remain married to your unbelieving husband or wife, for</span> God has called you to live in peace.” God wants us to live in harmony and get along with our husband or wife, even if he or she is not a Christian. This interpretation is implied by the NCV:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When this happens, the Christian man or woman is free. But God called us to live in peace. Wife, you don’t know; maybe you will save your husband. (NCV) <em>(NCV, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It explains why a believer should let his or her unbelieving spouse depart. It means “<span data-bnType=\"implied\">If your unbelieving husband or wife wants to divorce you, let them divorce you, for</span> God has called you to live in peace.” In other words, it will be difficult to live a peaceful life with an unbelieving husband or wife who wants to divorce you, so it is better to divorce. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In such cases the husband or wife is not required to stay with them, for God wants his children to live in peace. (NLT) <em>(RSV, CEV, NLT, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Several English versions leave this open or ambiguous (BSB, GNT, NET, GW, KJV, NASB, ESV, NRSV). It is probably best to see this as a general statement that indicates that the believer should try to live in peace with their spouse, maintaining the marriage if possible, and living in peaceful separation if not. A peaceful separation may also hold out hope of salvation and reconciliation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you:</strong> There is a textual problem here. Some Greek manuscripts have a second-person plural pronoun (<em>you</em>) and some have a first-person plural pronoun (“us”). The two options are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The original Greek text said <em>you</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God has called you to live in peace. (GNT) <em>(BSB, GNT, NJB, NET, NRSV, GW, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The original Greek text said “us.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God has called us in peace. (RSV) <em>(RSV, NIV, KJV, NASB, NCV, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1). This is the reading in the Greek UBS text.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This reading is given a B rating in the 4th edition.</span></span> In some languages it may be unnatural to use a second-person pronoun, or this may imply that Paul was not called to live in peace. In these languages it may be necessary to use an inclusive first-person plural pronoun.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in peace:</strong> The words <em>in peace</em> describe the way a believer is to live. Paul puts these words first in the sentence to show that they are emphatic, that is, these words are the most important part of the sentence. The words <em>in peace</em> can include the idea of living in harmony with others and peacefully inside oneself. In some languages it may be natural to translate the abstract noun <em>peace</em> as an adjective or adverb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a peaceful life</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>peacefully</p></blockquote>",

Perhaps/Possibly.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband?:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>save</em> in this context means “help/lead someone to receive salvation.” Paul meant that the woman might help her husband to believe in Jesus so that God would save him. (Paul uses the word <em>save</em> in this same way in 1 Corinthians 9:22 and Romans 11:14.)</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a rhetorical question. It indicates that a believing wife does not know whether or not she will be able to help her husband to believe in Jesus and be saved. There are two ways to translate this question:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>as a rhetorical question, possibly with an answer supplied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as a wife, how can you tell whether you are to be the salvation of your husband…? (NJB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a statement.

In some languages it may be natural to follow the RSV and not translate this conjunction explicitly.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>how do you know, husband…?:</strong> Consider whether it is natural to translate this question using exactly the same phrasing as the question in the previous verse part, or whether some variation is natural and desirable.

There are no longer any copies of this letter, so we can only guess what they wrote by reading Paul’s answers. Apparently some of the questions the Corinthians had asked were about marriage and sex. In this section Paul discussed these topics. He wrote about sexual intercourse, divorce, marrying again after a person’s husband or wife dies, and never marrying.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">From the way Paul talked, it appears that the Corinthians were thinking that if believers want to be holy, they should abstain from sexual relations. The Corinthians were wondering if married people should sleep together, if Christians who were married to non-Christians should divorce them, and if Christians should get married. Paul gave them some wise teaching on each of these topics. In 7:1–16 he addressed Christians who were married. In 7:17–24 he wrote about his general rule for Christians: Remain as you are. In 7:25–38 he taught Christians who were not married. In 7:39–40 he addressed women whose husbands had died.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other possible section headings include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul gave/wrote instructions about Christian marriage</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s teaching on marriage</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1047007017\" data-endVerseId=\"1047007024\"><h3>Paragraph 7:17–24</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In these verses Paul taught the Corinthians his general rule or principle: “Remain as you are.” He said that a believer does not have to change his or her situation in life to please God. So each believer should try to stay the way they were when God called them to belong to Christ. They could serve him as Jew or Gentile, married or single, and slave or free. They could please God in whatever situation he has put them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In these verses Paul began by giving his general rule (7:17). Then he gave an example of this rule: When you become a Christian, it does not matter if you are circumcised or not; just stay that way (7:18–19). Then he repeated the general rule (7:20). Then he gave a second example: When you become a Christian, it does not matter if you are a slave; you can serve God as a slave or as a free man (7:21–23). Then he repeated his general rule (7:24).</p></div><h4>7:17a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:17a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Regardless, each one should lead the life</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Except for that case, it is best for every believer to remain/continue living in the condition/situation</p></li><li><p>¶ But in general each of you should continue to live</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Regardless:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>Regardless</em> here introduces Paul’s general principle to which 7:15–16 was an exception. It can also be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>apart from that situation</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>except in a case like that</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but in general</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>each one should lead the life:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>each one should lead the life</em> is literally “so/thus let him walk.” The word “walk” is an idiom meaning to live day by day. (See the notes on 3:3d.) The word “so/thus” refers to the situation to which the Lord assigned the believer at the time when God called him. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so must he live (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>let each person lead the life (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>let everyone continue in the part (NJB)</p></blockquote><h4>7:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that the Lord has assigned to him</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>that the Lord Jesus gave to them</p></li><li><p>the way the Lord has given you to live,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Lord has assigned to him:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>has assigned</em> refers to dividing up and giving out something. This is a figure of speech. Paul said that the Lord has placed each believer in a certain situation or place in life. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whatever situation the Lord has put you in (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">When a person first believes in Jesus, he may be a slave or free, married or unmarried. God wants him to serve Christ in the situation he is in. He should not think he must change that place so that he can be a better follower of the Lord.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to him:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>to him</em> is literally “to each one,” and means “to each believer.”</p><h4>7:17c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:17c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and to which God has called him.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and where/as they were when God called them <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be his own/people</span>.</p></li><li><p>the way you were when God chose you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to serve/believe him</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and to which God has called him:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>called</em> means “invited, summoned.” See the notes on 7:15c, 1:1a, 1:2c, and 1:9. There are two ways of understanding the meaning of this verb:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to the call of God to salvation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>[let everyone continue]…as he was when God called him (NJB) <em>(GNT, RSV, NLT, NCV, NJB, REB, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to the call of God to a situation or condition in life. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>[let each person lead the life]…to which God called him (ESV) <em>(BSB, NIV, KJV, NASB, NRSV, ESV, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This interpretation is more likely, based on the way the word <em>called</em> is used in verse 18. In some languages it may be helpful to say explicitly to what God called believers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when God called them to be his own (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural use the second-person pronoun “you” as the GNT has done:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Each of you should go on living…as you were when God called you. (GNT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 7:17a-c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The BSB has reordered the verse parts. The Greek order of this verse is as follows:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Except, <sup>17b</sup>as the Lord assigned to each person, <sup>17c</sup>as God has called each person, <sup>17a</sup>so/thus let him/her walk.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to follow the Greek order, as the NET has done:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Only, <sup>17b</sup>as the Lord has assigned to each one, <sup>17c</sup>as God has called each person, <sup>17a</sup>so let him live. (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The NLT provides another model of how to reorder this verse:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You must accept <sup>17b</sup>whatever situation the Lord has put you in, <sup>17a</sup>and continue on as you were <sup>17c</sup>when God first called you. (NLT)</p></blockquote></div><h4>7:17d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:17d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>This is what I prescribe in all the churches.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>This is the same thing I tell believers to do in every church group I go to.</p></li><li><p>Whenever I go to visit any of the other churches, I tell them to follow this same teaching/principle.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>This is what I prescribe in all the churches:</strong> To <em>prescribe</em> something means to tell people a rule, or to order people to follow a rule. Paul is talking about a general principle or guideline. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This is my rule for all the churches. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This is a rule I make in all the churches. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I give this sort of direction in all the churches (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>what I prescribe:</strong> In some languages it may be more natural to translate the phrase <em>what I prescribe</em> as a noun phrase.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>17d</sup>In every church I tell the people <sup>17a</sup>to stay living in the situation <sup>17b</sup>that the Lord had put them in <sup>17c</sup>when God called them to be his own. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Now I say the same thing to you.</span> (compare the CEV)</p></blockquote></div>",

He meant that we cannot please God or make ourselves more holy by being circumcised or by not being circumcised. Customs like circumcision only affect us physically. These customs cannot make us more holy.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In the agreements or covenants that God made with Abraham and his descendants (Genesis 17:9–14) and with the nation Israel (Joshua 5:2–8), God commanded that all the boy babies be circumcised as a sign that they were joined together with God. But since God began his new agreement by sending his Son Jesus Christ to die as a complete sin payment, he no longer commands that boy babies be circumcised. Paul also taught that in Romans 2:28–29 and in Galatians 5:1–6.</span></span> Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For it makes no difference whether or not a man has been circumcised.

The CEV completes the sentence in a different way:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The important thing is to obey God’s commands. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>God’s commandments:</strong> In this context the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>God’s commandments</em> refers to God’s moral laws. Those include the Ten Commandments that God gave to Moses and other moral and ethical laws that came from them. Jesus and the apostles explained how those moral laws were to tell us how to live.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>When Moses gave God’s laws to the Israelite people under the first covenant/agreement, there were three kinds of laws:(1) The <u>moral laws</u>, that is, the Ten Commandments, giving the main rules for living, telling people what is right and what is wrong for them to do.(2) The <u>ceremonial laws</u>, rules for worshiping God under the first covenant. These included the system of sacrifices and offerings.(3) The <u>civil laws</u>, telling the people how to rule the nation. After Jesus came to earth and gave himself to God as the complete sin payment, God did away with the ceremonial laws because they were no longer needed. But Jesus taught people how to live following God’s moral laws. The teachings of Paul and the other apostles came from the teaching of Christ. See, for example, the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5–7 and the Great Commission in Matthew 28:18–20. In 1 Corinthians 7:19 Paul was talking about God’s moral laws as taught by Jesus and the apostles.See Law, “Teachings of Christ” in KBT.</span></span> Paul was not referring to the Jewish ceremonial law, of which being circumcised was a part.</p>",

This introduces a possible scenario or situation. There are two ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>as a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Were you called as a slave? (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a statement using a conditional clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If you were a slave when you were called…</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">In Greek the word translated <em>you</em> is singular. It is as though Paul were speaking to only one person. But actually his words are for any believer who is a slave, so this could be translated as a plural. You should translate it in a way that is natural in your language for addressing multiple people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Were you<sup>(plur)</sup> slaves…?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>slave:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>slave</em> refers to someone who belonged to their master as a possession. Slaves normally worked without pay. Their owners gave them food, clothes, and a place to stay. They were not allowed to leave their masters and their work. Many of the believers in Corinth were probably slaves.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>when you were called:</strong> The words <em>when you were called</em> refer to the time when the slave became a believer. There are two ways to translate them:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when you were called (REB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>using an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when God called you (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>7:21b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:21b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Do not let it concern you—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>you must not feel bad about that.</p></li><li><p>If that is true for you, do not worry about it.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Do not let it concern you:</strong> Paul was talking to slaves who were believers. It is likely that some of them thought they could serve Jesus Christ better if they were free. Paul wanted them to know that even if they were slaves, Jesus Christ was in control of their lives and their situation in life. They should be content to live as his followers, no matter what their situation was. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Don’t let that bother you. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Don’t let that worry you. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Don’t be sad/hurt in your heart, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">saying, “I cannot be a good follower of Christ if I am only a slave.”</span></p></blockquote><h4>7:21c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:21c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but if you can gain your freedom, take the opportunity.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>However, if you are able to become a free person, then do that.</p></li><li><p>But if your master lets you go free, then go.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>but</em> here introduces an exception or limitation to what Paul had just said. The slaves should not be troubled about their situation, but that did not mean Paul required them to remain slaves for always. Paul told them to gain their freedom if they could.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if you can gain your freedom, take the opportunity:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>take the opportunity</em> is literally “rather/instead use <span data-bnType=\"implied\">it</span>.” There are two ways to understand how a slave should “use” this situation:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Slaves should make use of their chance to be free by becoming free. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but if you get a chance to be free, take it (NLT) <em>(BSB, CEV, NLT, NIV, RSV, GNT, NET, NCV, GW, REB, NASB, KJV, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Slaves should make use of their slavery by remaining a slave and living as a slave in a way that honors the Lord. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>even if you have a chance of freedom, you should prefer to make full use of your condition as a slave (NJB) <em>(NRSV, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This is the interpretation that almost all English versions follow.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Here are some reasons for following the first interpretation:(1) The verb “use it” in Greek is in the past tense (aorist), which means it is something that happens at a specific time. This fits better with the meaning “If you get the opportunity to become free, <u>take it</u>.” This past tense does not fit well if Paul was saying: “If you get the opportunity to become free, remain a slave and work for the Lord as a slave.”(2) Paul did not tell slaves to run away (see Philemon 10–16), but he did know that many slave owners decided to free their slaves for one reason or another.(3) When Paul says, “do so,” we ask, do what? The answer is: “Make use of your opportunity to become free.”(4) The main thing Paul was saying in chapter 7 was “Remain as you are.” But already several times in this chapter he had given some exceptions to this rule. In 7:3–5a he gave a rule that married couples should not stop having sex with each other; but then in 7:5b-c he gave an exception to that rule. In 7:8 he gave a rule that Christians whose husband or wife had died should remain unmarried; then in 7:9 he gave an exception to that rule. In 7:12–14 he gave a rule that Christians who are married to non-Christians should not divorce their spouse; then in 7:15 he gave an exception to that rule. The same thing is true here in 7:21. In 7:21a-b Paul said that Christians who are slaves should not worry about being a slave; they can be good Christians as slaves. But in 7:21c he gave an exception: he said that if a slave can become free, that is all right too, and he should do it.(5) In the Roman world, slaves probably did not have a choice to remain slaves or to be freed. If their masters chose to free them, they probably had to accept it.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>gain your freedom:</strong> In some languages it may be natural to translate the noun <em>freedom</em> with an adjective. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>become free (JBP)</p></blockquote>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the one who was called in the Lord (NET) <em>(REB, NJB, KJV, NASB, RSV, ESV, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “he was called <u>by</u> the Lord,” that is, the Lord is the one who called the slave.

In section 6.1 of her article, Bendor-Samuel says that the phrase “in the Lord” occurs more than 50 times in the NT, and that it almost always means “as a Christian.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>he was called:</strong> This is in the passive. In some languages it may be natural to translate it with an active verb and to supply the subject “God”:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>God called him</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also 7:17c, 7:18a, and 7:21a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Lord’s freedman:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>freedman</em> refers to someone who used to be a slave but is now free. In this context this is a figure of speech. The Christian slave is actually still a slave in the human way of thinking, but God has rescued him from being like a slave to wrongdoing. He no longer has to do all the bad things people want to do. Paul encouraged and comforted slaves by reminding them of the kind of freedom they have as Christians.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This metaphor has several components or aspects of meaning:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>the Christian slave is free from the power of sin</p></li><li><p>the Lord is the one who made the slave free</p></li><li><p>the freedman belongs to the Lord, who is his protector or patron</p></li><li><p>the freedman is obliged to serve his protector/patron</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions translate the metaphor literally, so that any or all of the above components can be understood (see the BSB, NIV, GNT, KJV, NASB, REB, NET, GW, RSV, and ESV). Some English versions focus on one or the other of the components. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>is a freedman belonging to the Lord (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>free persons who belong to the Lord (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>free in the Lord (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his free people (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you translate this metaphor in a general way that allows readers to understand any or all of these aspects.</p><h4>7:22b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:22b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Conversely, he who was a free man when he was called is Christ’s slave.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>In the same way, a person who was free when God called/chose him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to become a Christian</span> now belongs to Christ and so is Christ’s slave.</p></li><li><p>In the same way, if you were without a master when God called/invited you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be joined together with the Lord Jesus Christ</span>, you now belong to Christ and he is your master.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Conversely, he who was a free man when he was called is Christ’s slave:</strong> Paul now addressed believers who were not slaves.

They could please God in whatever situation he has put them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In these verses Paul began by giving his general rule (7:17). Then he gave an example of this rule: When you become a Christian, it does not matter if you are circumcised or not; just stay that way (7:18–19). Then he repeated the general rule (7:20). Then he gave a second example: When you become a Christian, it does not matter if you are a slave; you can serve God as a slave or as a free man (7:21–23). Then he repeated his general rule (7:24).</p></div><h4>7:23a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:23a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>You were bought at a price;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> paid a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">high/big</span> price for you<sup>(sing)</sup>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus Christ</span> paid for you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with his blood/life</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You were bought at a price:</strong> Here Paul was speaking to all believers, both slaves and free people. This verse part is the same as 6:20a. See the notes on 6:20a. This is a metaphor taken from the custom of buying slaves in the market. When a man bought a slave, he owned him and the slave was obliged to obey his new master. In a similar way God paid for our freedom. So a believer does not belong to himself. He or she belongs to God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This verse part uses a passive verb. There are two ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You were bought with a price. (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using an active verb. The actor could be either Christ or God.

The words here are similar to what Paul said in 7:17 and 7:20.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">After the phrase that the BSB translates as <em>each one should remain</em>, the Greek text includes a phrase that can be translated as “with God” or “at the side of God” or “near God.” There are two ways to understand what that means here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “with God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">at his side to help</span>.” God is near to help the believer no matter what his place in life. Paul was comforting and encouraging the believers. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My friends, each of you should remain in fellowship with God in the same condition that you were when you were called. (GNT) <em>(GNT, GW and probably the KJV, RSV, ESV, NET, NCV, and NASB, which all say “with God”)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “before God,” that is, in the sight or presence of God, or with God looking on. Since God is watching, the believer should live in a way pleasing to God no matter what his place in life is. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So, my friends, everyone is to remain before God in the condition in which he received his call. (REB) <em>(NIV, NJB, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The BSB, CEV, and NLT do not explicitly translate this phrase. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), along with the majority of English versions. Paul wanted to remind the believers that God is present and can make each one content wherever he is.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Brothers:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Brothers</em> refers to all the Corinthian believers. Paul was addressing them in an affectionate way as members of the family of faith. The GNT translates it as “My friends.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>each one:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>each one</em> refers to each one of the group of believers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>should remain in the situation he was in when God called him:</strong> There are two ways to understand Paul’s meaning here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Paul meant that God called the believers to himself in a situation. They should remain in the situation they were in at that time. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>stay as you were when you were called (NCV) <em>(BSB, RSV, GNT, NJB, NCV, CEV, NLT, GW, NET, NASB, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Paul meant that God called the believer to a situation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>remain in the situation God called him to (NIV) <em>(NIV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).

Perhaps some of the Corinthian believers were thinking: “A person will be more holy and please God more if he remains unmarried.” Paul agreed that there are good reasons to remain unmarried. But he did not believe that it was a sin to get married. Paul allowed each person to choose for himself.</p></div><h4>7:25a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:25a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Now about virgins,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Now I will answer the question you asked me about the unmarried women.</p></li><li><p>¶ Now I will talk about what the single women should do.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Now about:</strong> The Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>Now about</em> here indicate that Paul was starting to talk about something else the Corinthians had written in their letter to him. He used this same phrase at several other places in 1 Corinthians to introduce a new topic (7:1, 8:1, 12:1, 16:1, 16:12). Introduce this new topic in a way that is natural for your language. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now about what you said in your letter</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>virgins:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>virgins</em> refers to people who have never had sexual intercourse. There are two ways to interpret it in this context:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to women only. This is the normal meaning of the English word <em>virgins</em>. The root form of this Greek word is used five more times in this paragraph. In all five of those occurrences it refers to women. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the young women who are not yet married (NLT) <em>(BSB, KJV, NIV, NASB, NRSV, GW, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to both men and women. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>people who have never been married (NET) <em>(RSV, GNT, NET, NJB, REB, CEV, ESV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). In the following verses Paul used the Greek word for “virgin” five more times. Each time the word clearly refers to a young woman so it is likely Paul had the same meaning in focus here. Also, the majority of commentaries follow interpretation (1).</p><h4>7:25b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:25b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I have no command from the Lord,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The Lord Jesus did not give me a command/rule about that.</p></li><li><p>The Lord Jesus has not told me what is best for them to do.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I have no command from the Lord:</strong> This verse part indicates that as far as Paul knew, the Lord Jesus had not taught specifically about this topic. Nor had Paul received any special revelation concerning this from the Lord. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I do not have a command from the Lord for them. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lord has not given me a command concerning them.</p></blockquote><h4>7:25c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:25c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>However, the Lord has been very kind to me, and so I believe you can trust what I say about this.</p></li><li><p>And yet, because the Lord has helped me to become a person whom people can trust, I will tell you<sup>(plur)</sup> what I think is best.</p></li><li><p>But I will give you my teaching/advice about this. You should listen to what I say, because the Lord has kindly <span data-bnType=\"implied\">helped/saved me and given me wisdom</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>but</em> here indicates a contrast. Paul did not have a command from Jesus to give, <u>but</u> instead he gave his own judgment.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I give a judgment:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>I give a judgment</em> can also be translated as “I give an opinion,” or “I tell you what I think.” In 2 Corinthians 8:10 the BSB translates the same clause as “And this is my opinion….” Paul was telling or advising the Corinthians what he thought they should do. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I give my opinion (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy:</strong> Paul indicated why the Corinthians could trust his judgment or opinion. It was because the Lord had been very kind to him. The Lord had made him a person whom they could trust. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as one shown mercy by the Lord to be trustworthy (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I’m a person to whom the Lord has shown mercy, so I can be trusted. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Lord’s mercy:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the Lord’s mercy</em> indicates that the Lord had been merciful to Paul. The Lord had been kind and compassionate to Paul in that he had forgiven him and called him to be an apostle and made him trustworthy. In some languages it may be natural to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Lord has been kind/compassionate to me</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>trustworthy:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>trustworthy</em> refers to someone who deserves trust, someone who is faithful. The Corinthians could depend on Paul to give them wise advice.</p>",

In other words, believing men who were married should remain married, and believing men who were not married should remain unmarried. However, what he said did not exclude women.

There are no longer any copies of this letter, so we can only guess what they wrote by reading Paul’s answers. Apparently some of the questions the Corinthians had asked were about marriage and sex. In this section Paul discussed these topics. He wrote about sexual intercourse, divorce, marrying again after a person’s husband or wife dies, and never marrying.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">From the way Paul talked, it appears that the Corinthians were thinking that if believers want to be holy, they should abstain from sexual relations. The Corinthians were wondering if married people should sleep together, if Christians who were married to non-Christians should divorce them, and if Christians should get married. Paul gave them some wise teaching on each of these topics. In 7:1–16 he addressed Christians who were married. In 7:17–24 he wrote about his general rule for Christians: Remain as you are. In 7:25–38 he taught Christians who were not married. In 7:39–40 he addressed women whose husbands had died.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other possible section headings include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul gave/wrote instructions about Christian marriage</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s teaching on marriage</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1047007025\" data-endVerseId=\"1047007028\"><h3>Paragraph 7:25–28</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul now began to talk to the believers about those people in their group who were not married. Perhaps some of the Corinthian believers were thinking: “A person will be more holy and please God more if he remains unmarried.” Paul agreed that there are good reasons to remain unmarried. But he did not believe that it was a sin to get married. Paul allowed each person to choose for himself.</p></div><h4>7:27a-d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Are you committed to a wife?…Are you free of commitment?:</strong> There is a problem with the punctuation of the Greek text here. The oldest Greek manuscripts do not have punctuation at all. The two options are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>These are questions. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do you have a wife?…are you divorced from your wife? (GW) <em>(BSB, REB, NIV, GNT, GW, KJV, NASB, RSV, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>These are statements. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The one bound to a wife should not seek divorce. (NET) <em>(NET, NJB, NLT, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option 1. However, in some languages it may not be natural to use rhetorical questions in this way. If this is the case in your language, it may be natural to use conditional statements. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>If you are joined to a wife, do not seek to be released; if you are freed of a wife, do not look for a wife. (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You should use whatever form is more natural in your language for emphasizing something.</p><h4>7:27a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:27a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Are you committed to a wife?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">However,</span> if you are a man who already has a wife,</p></li><li><p>But if you are a man who is already married,</p></li><li><p>Suppose you are a man who is already married.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Are you committed to a wife?:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>Are you committed to a wife?</em> is literally “Have you become tied to a woman?” This is a figure of speech. A man is “tied to a woman” in the sense that he is legally her husband and permanently responsible for her. There are two ways to translate this figure of speech:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use this or a similar metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Are you bound in marriage? (REB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate it without a metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If you have a wife (NLT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate in the way that is most natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you:</strong> The Greek pronoun that the BSB translates as <em>you</em> is singular. Paul addressed the men in the Corinthian church. He was not talking to just one person. In some languages it is more natural to translate this using a plural pronoun.</p><h4>7:27b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:27b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Do not seek to be released.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>do not try to find a way to divorce her.</p></li><li><p>Do not divorce your wife.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Do not seek to be released:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>Do not seek to be released</em> is more literally “Do not seek release.” This is a command. Paul commanded married men to remain married. They should not try to free themselves from the marriage bond. Consider whether it is natural in your language to use this figure of speech here. The RSV translates it using the figure of speech:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not seek to be free. (RSV)</p></blockquote><h4>7:27c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:27c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Are you free of commitment?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>If you do not have a wife,</p></li><li><p>If you are an unmarried man,</p></li></ul></div><h4>7:27d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:27d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Do not look for a wife.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>do not try to find/obtain a wife.</p></li><li><p>do not search for a woman to marry.</p></li><li><p>then do not get married.</p></li></ul></div><h4>7:27c-d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Are you free of commitment? Do not look for a wife:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>free of commitment</em> probably refers to any men who were not at present married, included the widowed, the never-married, and the divorced. Paul advised such men to remain content in their present situation.</p>",

Paul agreed with the Corinthian believers that being unmarried is good, but he did not agree with their reasons for it. There is nothing in God’s laws or in Jesus’ teaching saying that it is a sin to marry. So it is wrong to say that a believer can be more holy or more pleasing to God if he remains unmarried. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But it is not a sin for you to get married.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But getting married is not sinful.</p></blockquote><h4>7:28c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:28c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And if a virgin marries,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And if a Christian girl/virgin marries,</p></li><li><p>And if the unmarried women <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you wrote to me about</span> do get married,</p></li></ul></div><h4>7:28d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:28d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>she has not sinned.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>she not sinning.</p></li><li><p>that is not a sin.</p></li></ul></div><h4>7:28c-d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if a virgin marries, she has not sinned:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>virgin</em> here refers to any unmarried woman. It was assumed in such a culture that this woman would be a virgin, but this was not Paul’s main point here. In your translation, it is fine to use a word implying virginity, like the older English word “maiden.” If, however, such a word is normally used only in technical or medical contexts, you may wish to follow the GNT and translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if an unmarried woman marries, she hasn’t committed a sin (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>7:28e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:28e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But those who marry will face troubles in this life,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But as you know, people who get married will suffer difficulties in their daily life,</p></li><li><p>However, married people will experience unpleasant/painful things in their life in this world,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>But</em> here introduces a disadvantage to marrying. Even though it is not sinful, it involves some problems.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those who marry will face troubles in this life:</strong> The English idiom <em>face troubles</em> means to experience many difficulties or hard times. The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>in this life</em> is literally “in the flesh” and refers to life on this earth. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those who marry will have worldly troubles (RSV)</p></blockquote><h4>7:28f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:28f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and I want to spare you this.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and I would like you to be free from suffering such troubles.</p></li><li><p>and I do not want you to have to experience/suffer those difficulties.</p></li><li><p>and I would like to keep you from having hard things like that happen to you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I want to spare you this:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>I want to spare you this</em> indicates that Paul wished to keep or protect the Corinthians from experiencing unnecessary trouble. He knew that marriage and family life could involve a lot of pain and suffering, especially at a time when unbelievers were persecuting Christians. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am trying to spare you those problems.

He told them that the present way of life in this world would not last much longer. He instructed them as to how they should think and live when all will soon change.</p></div><h4>7:29a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:29a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>What I am saying, brothers, is that the time is short.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ My fellow believers, I will explain what I mean.

Soon God will change the world and the way people live in it. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we<sup>(incl)</sup> do not have much time</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>only a short while remains</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the time we live in will not last long (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>there is not much time left (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the time:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>time</em> refers to a period of time set aside for a purpose. Here it refers to the time God has set aside to finish his work. That time will end when Christ comes back to earth again.</p><h4>7:29b-31a</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">These five verse parts are very similar in form. Each of them is a polite or soft command. Paul was telling the Corinthian believers how he wanted them to live. He wanted them to realize that the things of this earthly life are not the most important. Christ will return and then all these things will come to an end. Things like marrying and buying are all part of our life in this world and will not last forever.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to translate these indirect third-person commands as polite second-person commands. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>From now on I want those of you who have wives to live as if you had no wives, those of you who weep as though you did not weep, those of you who are joyful, as though you were not, and those of you who make a purchase, as though you had nothing. And those of you who use the things of this world, I want you to not be dependent on them.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">For another suggestion as to how to break up the long sentence in the BSB into shorter sentences, see the General Comment on 7:29b-31a at the end of 7:31a.</p><h4>7:29b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:29b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>From now on those who have wives should live as if they had none;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>So from this time on, Christian/believing men who are married should live as if they were not married.</p></li><li><p>So for the rest of the time we are living in this world, do not be <span data-bnType=\"implied\">overly/too</span> concerned/worried about your wife/marriage.</p></li><li><p>So during the time we have left in this world, remember that having a wife or not is not the most important thing in our life.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those who have wives should live as if they had none:</strong> In this part Paul addressed men, but the same teaching would be true for anyone who was married. Paul wanted them to remember that our time here in this life is short. He did not want them to spend all their time thinking about the things of this life such as marriage.

There are no longer any copies of this letter, so we can only guess what they wrote by reading Paul’s answers. Apparently some of the questions the Corinthians had asked were about marriage and sex. In this section Paul discussed these topics. He wrote about sexual intercourse, divorce, marrying again after a person’s husband or wife dies, and never marrying.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">From the way Paul talked, it appears that the Corinthians were thinking that if believers want to be holy, they should abstain from sexual relations. The Corinthians were wondering if married people should sleep together, if Christians who were married to non-Christians should divorce them, and if Christians should get married. Paul gave them some wise teaching on each of these topics. In 7:1–16 he addressed Christians who were married. In 7:17–24 he wrote about his general rule for Christians: Remain as you are. In 7:25–38 he taught Christians who were not married. In 7:39–40 he addressed women whose husbands had died.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other possible section headings include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul gave/wrote instructions about Christian marriage</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s teaching on marriage</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1047007029\" data-endVerseId=\"1047007031\"><h3>Paragraph 7:29–31</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul addressed the whole group of believers.

All these things are what people here on earth do. Believers do these things also. But believers are not to be <em>dependent on</em> them; that is, they are not to be so absorbed in them that they spend all their time thinking about only those things. They are not to allow those things to control them. Believers can still make use of these things, but their primary focus should stay on God.

Although in general this can be a good thing or a bad thing, in this context it is a good thing.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Here is one reason why this is probably a good thing: In 7:32b-c, Paul says “The unmarried man is concerned about the work of the Lord, how he can please the Lord.” In other places where Paul talks about pleasing the Lord or pleasing God, it is a good thing. (See Romans 8:8, 1 Thessalonians 2:15, 4:1, and Colossians 1:10, 3:20.) So here in 1 Corinthians 7:32b-c, being “concerned about the work of the Lord” is probably also a good thing.But this interpretation does have difficulties. In 7:32a Paul said he wants the Corinthian believers to be “free from concern” (Greek: <em>amerimnos</em>). So when Paul said in 7:32b-34e that some people are “concerned about the work of the Lord” and other people are “concerned about the affairs of this world,” he may have meant this in a bad sense. Some Corinthian believers were worried about how to please the Lord, and Paul wanted them to learn that they did not have to worry about this. They could please the Lord if they were married or single. Read Gordon Fee’s commentary on 1 Corinthians (pages 342–345) for a discussion of this interpretation problem.</span></span> See Philippians 2:20, where the same word is used in a positive way. There the BSB translates it as “will genuinely care for [your needs].” Other ways to translate this here include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A man who is not married is busy with the Lord’s work.

There are no longer any copies of this letter, so we can only guess what they wrote by reading Paul’s answers. Apparently some of the questions the Corinthians had asked were about marriage and sex. In this section Paul discussed these topics. He wrote about sexual intercourse, divorce, marrying again after a person’s husband or wife dies, and never marrying.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">From the way Paul talked, it appears that the Corinthians were thinking that if believers want to be holy, they should abstain from sexual relations. The Corinthians were wondering if married people should sleep together, if Christians who were married to non-Christians should divorce them, and if Christians should get married. Paul gave them some wise teaching on each of these topics. In 7:1–16 he addressed Christians who were married. In 7:17–24 he wrote about his general rule for Christians: Remain as you are. In 7:25–38 he taught Christians who were not married. In 7:39–40 he addressed women whose husbands had died.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other possible section headings include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul gave/wrote instructions about Christian marriage</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s teaching on marriage</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1047007032\" data-endVerseId=\"1047007035\"><h3>Paragraph 7:32–35</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul addressed the whole group of believers. He wanted them to be “free from concern” (7:32a). Many scholars think that in these verses Paul was giving a reason why he thought it was good to stay unmarried. This paragraph is difficult to interpret.</p></div><h4>7:35a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:35a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I am saying this for your own good,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I talk to you like this because I want to help you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">think about what is best for you.</span></p></li><li><p>I have said these things to you because I think it will help you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to decide for yourself what is best for you to do</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I am saying this for your own good:</strong> The word <em>this</em> refers to the things Paul had just said. Paul indicated that he had written in this way in order to help the Corinthian believers. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I’m saying this for your benefit. (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>7:35b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:35b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>not to restrict you,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I am not giving you commands you must obey.</p></li><li><p>I do not want to take away your freedom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to decide what is best.</span></p></li><li><p>-or-</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You are free to get married or stay single, and</span> I do not want to limit you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not to restrict you:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>not to restrict you</em> is literally a figure of speech: “I am not trying to throw a noose over you.” A noose is a rope tied in a circle that is used to catch and tie up animals. Paul meant that he was not giving the Corinthian believers rules that they must obey. He was not trying to take away their freedom to choose how to live for Christ. There are two ways to translate this figure of speech:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>using a metaphor or simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have no wish to keep you on a tight rein. (REB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>without a figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>not to limit you (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>7:35c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:35c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but in order to promote proper decorum</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Rather, I want to help you to live in a way/manner that is appropriate/fitting,</p></li><li><p>On the contrary, I want to help you live/behave as the Lord’s people should live/behave.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but in order to promote proper decorum:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>in order to promote proper decorum</em> is more literally “to/for what is proper/seemly.” This refers to behavior that is orderly and decent. Paul was indicating that he had written these things to the Corinthians in order to help them to live in ways fitting for people who belong to the Lord. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to promote what is appropriate (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I want you to do what is right and proper (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>7:35d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:35d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and undivided devotion to the Lord.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so you can serve the Lord in the best way with nothing worrying/distracting you.</p></li><li><p>and so that you can work for the Lord without always having to think of other things you have to do.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and undivided devotion to the Lord:</strong> This verse part indicates a second thing that Paul wanted to promote. The first is in 7:35c. Paul wanted to promote or encourage two things: first, what is proper, and second, <em>undivided devotion to the Lord</em>. This verse part refers to serving the Lord faithfully without distractions. Other ways to translate it include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that you are able to give your undivided attention to the Lord (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to give yourselves fully to the Lord without concern for other things (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that without distraction you may give…constant service to the Lord (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>undivided:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>undivided</em> literally means “not pulled or dragged away”; that is, not distracted by things that take your thoughts or attention away from what you are doing. It refers to being able to do something without having to think of something else. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>unhindered (NRSV)</p></blockquote>",

These verses are difficult to understand. We do not know what was happening in Corinth, and we do not know what the Corinthian believers had said to Paul in their letter. They probably had asked him some specific questions about virgins and whether it was best for a man to marry a virgin he was engaged to.</p></div><h4>7:36a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:36a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>However, if someone thinks he is acting inappropriately toward his betrothed,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ If there is a man who is engaged to be married to a girl, and he thinks he is not treating her well <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by delaying their marriage</span>,</p></li><li><p>¶ If any of you have been engaged <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for a long time</span>, and think you are not being fair to your fiancée,</p></li><li><p>¶ As for those of you who are engaged <span data-bnType=\"implied\">but have delayed getting married</span>: if you have begun to think that you are acting inappropriately toward your girlfriend,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>However:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>However</em> here introduces a contrast. The contrast is between what Paul said in the previous verse about one reason not to marry and what he says in this verse about one reason to marry. Many English versions do not translate this conjunction. Other English versions use the word “But.” Translate this contrast in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if someone thinks he is acting inappropriately toward his betrothed:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates <em>acting inappropriately</em> means to behave in a way that is improper or dishonorable. Apparently there were some men in the Corinthian church who were engaged to be married but had delayed getting married. Now one or more of these men was beginning to think that he was not doing the right thing. Apparently he was thinking that it was unfair to the girl. Although Paul did not say why this was so, presumably it was because the man was preventing her from entering a marriage that would give her a home and family. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his fiancée (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if someone thinks that he is treating his fiancée badly</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if a man thinks he is not doing the right thing with the girl he is engaged to (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>his betrothed:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>his betrothed</em> is literally “his virgin.” There are two ways to understand this phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to the man’s fiancée, the girl to whom he was betrothed or engaged to be married. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the girl he is engaged to (NCV) <em>(BSB, RSV, ESV, REB, NIV, GNT, NJB, NLT, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to the man’s unmarried daughter. The community expected that he would make marriage arrangements for this girl. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his virgin daughter (GW) <em>(NASB, GW, probably the KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The NET is ambiguous. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). The virgin is thus the young woman whom the man’s family had made arrangements for him to marry. His family and the community expected that he would marry this girl. You should translate this using a phrase that is natural in your language, such as “his fiancée.” Try to avoid using an expression that suggests that the man had himself pledged/promised to marry this girl.</p><h4>7:36b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:36b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and if she is beyond her youth</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and if he strongly desires to marry her,</p></li><li><p>and you feel passionately toward her,</p></li><li><p>and if you are deeply in love with her,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if she is beyond her youth:</strong> There are two ways to understand the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>she is beyond her youth</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to the man and means “has strong sexual desires.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if his passions are too strong (GNT) <em>(NLT, GNT, RSV, ESV, REB, NJB, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to the woman and means “old enough that she should marry.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if she is almost past the best age to marry (NCV) <em>(BSB, NCV, NIV, KJV, NASB, NET, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). It has stronger support from the translations and the commentaries. It also fits better with the interpretation followed by these notes that Paul was addressing a man and his fiancée. However, both interpretations have strong support, and if your national language version follows the second view, you may wish to follow that.</p><h4>7:36c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:36c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and they ought to marry,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and so he thinks that he should marry her,</p></li><li><p>and now you realize it would be good to marry her,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they ought to marry:</strong> This verse part is more literally “it has to be so/thus.” This probably refers to the man’s own judgment or understanding that it is right for him to get married. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and it has to be (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he feels that they ought to marry (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>thinks…that things should take their due course (NJB)</p></blockquote><h4>7:36d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:36d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>let him do as he wishes;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>then he should do what he thinks is good.</p></li><li><p>then you should marry her, if that is what you want.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>let him do as he wishes:</strong> This implies that the man should marry his fiancée. In some languages it may be natural to make this explicit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He should do as he wants <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and marry her</span>.</p></blockquote><h4>7:36e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:36e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>he is not sinning;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He is not doing wrong.</p></li><li><p>It is not a sin.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he is not sinning:</strong> Paul used almost these same words in 7:28b and d. There he told unmarried men that if they got married “you do not sin,” and he told “the virgin” that if she got married, “she does not sin.” He said again here that it was not a sin to get married.</p><h4>7:36f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:36f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>they should get married.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The couple should marry.</p></li><li><p>You should marry her.</p></li></ul></div>",

He must have “settled the matter in his own mind,” “be under no compulsion,” “have control over his own will,” and “made up his mind.” If these conditions exist, then the man has “done the right thing” in deciding not to marry.</p><h4>7:37a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:37a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But the man who is firmly established in his heart</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>On the other hand, suppose that this man has firmly decided what he will do</p></li><li><p>But perhaps you have come to a definite conclusion in your heart/mind <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that it is better not to marry</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the man who is firmly established in his heart:</strong> The Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>the man who is firmly established in his heart</em> are more literally “whoever stands firm in his heart.” This is a figure of speech that refers to someone who has made a decision that he is sure is the right one and is determined to keep. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if someone stands firm in his resolve (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if a man is steadfast in his purpose (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some language it may be helpful to make it explicit that the decision was a decision not to marry. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if a man…has firmly made up his mind not to marry (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if a man is sure in his own mind that there is no need for marriage (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>7:37b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:37b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and under no constraint,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and no one is forcing him to decide one way or another.</p></li><li><p>and you decided/chose this freely,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and under no constraint:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>under no constraint</em> is more literally “not having necessity.” This probably refers to a situation in which no one is telling the man what to do. He does not feel forced or obliged by any outside pressure to refrain from marriage. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>without being forced (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>7:37c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:37c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>with control over his will</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He is able to exercise self-control</p></li><li><p>and you can control your passions/desires.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse part begins with a Greek conjunction that is often translated as “but.” It introduces another condition which is necessary for it to be right for the man not get married. Since this contrasts with the previous condition, the NIV, RSV, and NJB translate the Greek conjunction as “but.” The GNT, however, translates it as “and.” Connect these two conditions in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with control over his will:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>with control over his will</em> is literally “has authority over/concerning his own will.” This probably refers to the man’s self-control over his sexual desires. Some English versions make it explicit that this is the aspect of his <em>will</em> that is referred to here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>having his desire under control (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if…he can control his passion (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>7:37d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:37d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and resolve in his heart not to marry the virgin,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and he has decided to keep his fiancée a virgin.</p></li><li><p>And so you have decided that you will not marry your fiancée.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>resolve in his heart:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>resolve in his heart</em> is similar to the phrase “firmly established in his heart” in 7:37a. It means that someone has made a decision that he is sure is the right one and is determined to keep. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who has made up his mind (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he decides (EASY)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not to marry the virgin:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>not to marry the virgin</em> is literally “to keep his own virgin.” It probably means “to keep his fiancée as a virgin.” It does not say whether or not the engagement will be continued.</p><h4>7:37e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:37e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>he will do well.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>If he does that, he will do a good thing <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in God’s eyes</span>.</p></li><li><p>It is fine/acceptable for you to decline to marry her.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he will do well:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>he will do well</em> is literally “he does well.” Paul was saying that what the man was doing was good and acceptable.</p>",

There are no longer any copies of this letter, so we can only guess what they wrote by reading Paul’s answers. Apparently some of the questions the Corinthians had asked were about marriage and sex. In this section Paul discussed these topics. He wrote about sexual intercourse, divorce, marrying again after a person’s husband or wife dies, and never marrying.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">From the way Paul talked, it appears that the Corinthians were thinking that if believers want to be holy, they should abstain from sexual relations. The Corinthians were wondering if married people should sleep together, if Christians who were married to non-Christians should divorce them, and if Christians should get married. Paul gave them some wise teaching on each of these topics. In 7:1–16 he addressed Christians who were married. In 7:17–24 he wrote about his general rule for Christians: Remain as you are. In 7:25–38 he taught Christians who were not married.

Apparently the Corinthians had asked Paul whether they should remarry. Some of the believers seem to have thought that these widows could be more holy and please God more if they stayed unmarried. Paul said that when a woman’s husband dies, that breaks the marriage tie, and in God’s eyes it is all right for her to marry someone else. But it is also all right if she remains unmarried, and in Paul’s opinion, she may be happier that way.</p></div><h4>7:39a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:39a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ A wife is joined/tied/united to her husband as long as he is alive.</p></li><li><p>¶ A married woman is obliged to remain her husband’s wife for his whole life.</p></li><li><p>¶ If a woman is married, the laws of marriage make her permanently married to her husband all his life.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>A wife is bound to her husband:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>bound</em> indicates that marriage obliges the two people to behave in a certain way to one another, both in the eyes of the law and in the eyes of God. This the same word Paul used in 7:27a, where the BSB translated it as “committed.” See the note on 7:27a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as long as he lives:</strong> Paul indicated that marriage is supposed to be permanent. He did not want believers to get divorced. Here Paul repeated in different words the same thing he said in 7:10–11.</p><h4>7:39b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:39b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But if her husband dies,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But if her husband dies,</p></li><li><p>However, if it happens that he dies before she does,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>But</em> here introduces a contrasting set of circumstances. That new set of circumstances is if her husband dies. His death sets her free from her marriage. In some languages a conjunction may not be natural here. The RSV does not translate the conjunction and begins a new sentence.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if her husband dies:</strong> A marriage ends when the husband or wife dies. It is possible that some believers in Corinth thought that a husband and wife were “bound” (permanently joined) in marriage not only in life here on earth, but in the future life also. (See Matthew 22:23–33). Paul told them that the marriage tie is for life here on earth only.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>dies:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>dies</em> is literally “sleeps.” The word “sleep” is a euphemism for talking about death. A euphemism is an indirect way of saying something that might offend someone if it was said directly. You may substitute a euphemism that is natural in your language if death is something you would not talk about directly and if the meaning remains clear.</p><h4>7:39c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:39c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>she is free to marry anyone she wishes,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>then it is all right for her to marry someone else if she wants to,</p></li><li><p>she is released <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from that marriage</span> and may get married again to any man she wants to.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>she is free to marry anyone she wishes:</strong> The word <em>free</em> here contrasts with the word “bound” in 7:39a. The widow is neither obliged to marry again nor obliged to remain unmarried.

They had asked him whether it was acceptable for them to eat the meat of an animal that had been sacrificed to an idol. The primary context for eating such meat was at an idol’s temple. Sometimes an animal would be offered to a false god in connection with a celebration such as a birthday or wedding to seek the god’s blessing and presence at the celebration. The animal would be butchered by a priest and a portion of the meat would be burned on an altar as an offering to the false god. Some of the remaining meat would be returned to the person who offered it and could be eaten together with family or other invited guests at a private banquet room at the temple. (Some of the remaining meat might be sent to the meat market to be sold, a situation that Paul addresses in 10:25–26.)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">There were two opinions in the Corinthian church about whether this meat could be eaten by a believer in Christ. Some of the Corinthian believers, including those who wrote the letter, understood that idols were only things that people have made or imagined. They were hoping Paul would agree with them that it was acceptable to eat this meat. However, some other believers thought that it was wrong to enter a temple and eat such meat. They still believed the false gods were real and believed that eating meat offered to them in sacrifice was an act of worship or fellowship with these gods.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul agreed in this chapter that the idols worshiped at these temples were not real gods. But he did not give permission to eat this meat at their temple. Doing so might influence other believers to also eat the meat, even though they believed it was wrong. Paul asked the Corinthians believers to act in love toward these brothers rather than selfishly demanding the right to eat this meat.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In chapter 10, Paul will continue to answer the question about eating meat sacrificed to idols. He says that a believer can have no part in the worship of idols and also that demons are active in the sacrifices to idols. He also addresses the separate situations of buying and eating meat sold in the meat market and what to do when someone invites you to eat meat in their home. Before this, in chapter 9, he uses himself as an illustration of the principle he set down at the end of chapter 8 of giving up your rights in love. He had the right to be paid for his work as an apostle, but he gave up his right so that the good news of Jesus would be better accepted.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">It is good to translate this section before you decide on a heading for it. Some other possible headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul gave instructions about eating meat of/from animals that had been sacrificed to false gods</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Believers should not eat anything that causes other believers to sin</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1047008001\" data-endVerseId=\"1047008003\"><h3>Paragraph 8:1–3</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul introduced his new topic of eating the meat of animals that had been offered to idols. He talked about the difference between doing things because we know something and doing things because we love other people.</p></div><h4>8:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Now about food sacrificed to idols:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Now I say this concerning meat of/from animals that have been sacrificed to idols/gods.</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">You</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">also asked</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">if it is right to eat</span> meat that people have offered to false gods. So now <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I will talk/write to you</span> about that.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Now about:</strong> The Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>Now about</em> here introduce the next topic Paul wanted to discuss: whether or not to eat the meat of animals that had been sacrificed to idols. This was probably something the Corinthians had written about in their earlier letter to Paul. Some English versions make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now, concerning what you wrote about… (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In your letter you asked me about food offered to idols. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>food sacrificed to idols:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>food sacrificed to idols</em> is formed from two root words, “idol” plus “to sacrifice.” Most versions are like the BSB and translate this as “<u>food</u> sacrificed/offered to idols.” A few versions translate this as “<u>meat</u> sacrificed to idols” since this offering was always meat.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Greek root <em>θύω</em> that is compounded in the Greek word <em>εἰδωλόθυτος</em> ‘food sacrificed to idols’ means “to kill” or “to slaughter ceremonially in offering a sacrifice.” This implies that the word always refers to meat because wine or grain offerings are not “killed.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In this chapter Paul was talking about feasts that were eaten in a temple for an idol. When people brought an animal to a temple to be offered to an idol, the priests would kill the animal and burn parts of it on the altar there for the false god that the idol represented. The priests kept some parts of the meat for themselves and gave the rest of it to the person who brought the animal. That person could then use that meat to have a feast in the temple for himself and any invited guests.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>meat <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that people have</span> sacrificed to idols</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>food which has been dedicated to false gods (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>meat that has been grilled/burned at shrines/temples</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>idols:</strong> Jewish people and Christians used the word <em>idols</em> to describe objects or statues that represent a god. People used these <em>idols</em> when they worshiped the gods. Often the idols were made of wood or stone. Depending on the context, the word “idol” can refer to the statue, to the god of the stature, or to both. Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>image/object/statue that is worshiped</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>gods</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>false gods</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>fetishes</p></blockquote><h4>8:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>We know that we all have knowledge.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It is true, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">say,</span> we<sup>(incl)</sup> all know <span data-bnType=\"implied\">many things about God</span>.</p></li><li><p>I agree with you that we <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believers</span> all know <span data-bnType=\"implied\">things about God</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>We know:</strong> Paul was talking here about something that the Corinthians had said in their letter to him. He agreed with what they said. So when Paul said “we,” he meant himself and the Corinthian believers. This is an inclusive pronoun.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we all have knowledge:</strong> These words are probably a quotation from the Corinthians’ letter to Paul. Some English versions make this clear by using quotation marks. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“all of us possess knowledge” (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Quotation marks alone will not make this clear to someone who is simply listening to this text. So you may wish to follow the REB and supply this information:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>‘We all have knowledge,’ as you say. (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>knowledge:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>knowledge</em> here refers to the knowledge that the Holy Spirit gives to all believers concerning God and his ways. Refer to your translation of <em>knowledge</em> in 1:5. Paul and the Corinthians all had this knowledge, so the pronoun “we” is inclusive.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to translate the abstract noun <em>knowledge</em> as a verb. It may also be necessary to supply the content of their knowledge. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we all know <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about God</span></p></blockquote><h4>8:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Knowledge puffs up,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Knowledge makes <span data-bnType=\"implied\">us</span><sup>(incl)</sup> arrogant,</p></li><li><p>Knowing <span data-bnType=\"implied\">things about God</span> can make <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> feel big,</p></li><li><p>When you<sup>(plur)</sup> know something, that makes you feel important.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Knowledge puffs up:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>puffs up</em> originally meant “to blow air into something to make it bigger.” In 1 Corinthians, Paul uses the word to simply mean “to cause a person to be arrogant.” Knowing things can make people feel arrogant. Some of the believers in Corinth had wrongly become proud about what they knew about God and how to follow Christ. Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Knowledge makes people arrogant (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>knowledge makes us proud of ourselves (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>knowledge makes us feel important (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to translate the abstract noun <em>Knowledge</em> as a verb:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When you know something, that makes you proud/arrogant.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>If you think you know something, then you boast.</p></blockquote><h4>8:1d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:1d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but love builds up.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but love encourages <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s people</span>.</p></li><li><p>but loving <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other people</span> makes <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the church</span> strong <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in faith</span>.</p></li><li><p>But when you<sup>(plur)</sup> care about other believers, you cause them to be better.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>love builds up:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>builds up</em> means to encourage someone and make them strong in their faith. In Greek, there is no explicit object to the verb. It is not clear who is built up by love. If you need to supply an object, try to translate this in a general way indicating that love builds up everyone involved. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it is love that strengthens the church (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>love encourages people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the nature of love is that it serves/helps other people to grow in their faith</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>love:</strong> In this context, the word <em>love</em> means the devotion shown toward another person that causes someone to seek what is good for that person. It does not refer to romantic love between a man and a woman or husband and wife. In some languages it may be natural to translate the abstract noun <em>love</em> as a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When you love someone, you make them strong.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>If people devote themselves to others, that helps/encourages them.</p></blockquote>",

Sometimes an animal would be offered to a false god in connection with a celebration such as a birthday or wedding to seek the god’s blessing and presence at the celebration. The animal would be butchered by a priest and a portion of the meat would be burned on an altar as an offering to the false god. Some of the remaining meat would be returned to the person who offered it and could be eaten together with family or other invited guests at a private banquet room at the temple.

Before this, in chapter 9, he uses himself as an illustration of the principle he set down at the end of chapter 8 of giving up your rights in love.

Consider what is a natural way to translate this kind of general principle in your language.

The implication of this verse part is that the person may know about something, but he does not use that knowledge in a way that shows love for his fellow believers. Therefore he does not know as he ought to know.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to supply an object for the verb <em>know</em>.

In this paragraph he began by agreeing with them about several things.</p></div><h4>8:4a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:4a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So about eating food sacrificed to idols:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Well then, here is what I say/teach about eating meat that has been sacrificed to idols/gods.</p></li><li><p>¶ Now, I give this answer to what you<sup>(plur)</sup> said about eating meat of/from animals that people have offered/given to false gods.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So about eating food sacrificed to idols:</strong> In this verse part Paul reintroduced the topic that the Corinthians had asked him about in their letter. He had also introduced this topic in 8:1a. Here he is more specific, mentioning <em>eating</em> this food. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So this is what I say about eating meat sacrificed to idols (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So, what about eating meat that has been offered to idols? (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>So about…:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB has translated as <em>So</em>, together with the repetition of the topic (food sacrificed to idols), indicates that Paul is returning to the topic mentioned in 8:1a. You should introduce this return to topic in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Well then, about… (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Now about… (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So this is what I say about… (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>eating food sacrificed to idols:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>food sacrificed to idols</em> is the same as in 8:1a. Translate it here as you did there.</p><h4>8:4b-c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In these verse parts Paul stated things that he and the Corinthians who had written the letter to him all believed. He may be directly quoting two things they said in their letter. Or he may be restating what they said in their own words. Some English versions (RSV, ESV, REB, NET) use quotations marks to indicate that Paul is quoting, but most versions do not. There is no way to know for sure since we do not have a copy of the Corinthians’ letter to Paul. Some ways to translate this that indicate that Paul is agreeing with something they had said are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we know that “an idol has no real existence,” and that “there is no God but one.” (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as you say, we know that an idol is nothing at all in the world and that there is no God but one</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I agree with you that idols do not really exist and that there is only one God.</p></blockquote><h4>8:4b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:4b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>We know that an idol is nothing at all in the world,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>We<sup>(incl)</sup> know, as you say, that none of the idols/gods in the world are real gods,</p></li><li><p>I agree with you<sup>(plur)</sup> that false gods are not alive,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>We know:</strong> The pronoun <em>We</em> here is inclusive. It refers to Paul himself and some of the believers in Corinth, at least the ones who wrote the letter to Paul. Paul had probably taught them that the gods represented by idols were not real. But Paul says in verse 8:7 that at least some of the believers at Corinth did not know or believe this.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>an idol is nothing at all in the world:</strong> This indicates that none of the idols in the world exist as living beings. They are made of things such as gold or stone, but they do not have life. They do not represent true gods, they do not hear prayers, and they cannot help or hurt people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>none of the idols in this world are alive (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>an idol is not really a god</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>false/idol gods do not really exist</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>idol:</strong> The word <em>idol</em> here, as in 8:1, describes an object or statue that represents a god. In this context, when Paul agrees that “an idol is nothing,” he is referring primarily to the god that is represented by the idol. The god is nothing. The idol is nothing more than the object or statue. It is not a god. Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>gods</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>false/fake gods</p></blockquote><h4>8:4c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:4c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and that there is no God but one.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and there is only the one God.</p></li><li><p>and that the God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">whom we</span><sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">worship</span> is the only <span data-bnType=\"implied\">true and living</span> God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>there is no God but one:</strong> This is another thing that Paul and most of the Corinthian believers knew: there is only one true God, the living and powerful God. This truth is basic to both Jewish people and to Christians, and so was certainly something that Paul and the other teachers had taught the believers in Corinth. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>there is only one God (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>there is no other god beside the true God</p></blockquote>",

Many people thought of the idols as being real gods or as representing real gods. Paul did not agree that they were gods. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>beings whom/that people call gods</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>things called gods (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>People may say that there are gods (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>whether in heaven or on earth:</strong> Paul was indicating that people talked about gods as either dwelling in heaven or on earth.</p><h4>8:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(as there are many so-called gods and lords),</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and in fact there are plenty of gods like this and plenty of lords,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They actually worship/honor</span> many such gods and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">try to please/serve</span> many such powerful spiritual beings.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(as there are many so-called gods and lords):</strong> Paul adds that some of these so-called gods are referred to as <em>gods</em> and some are called <em>lords</em>. He himself did not think of idols as real gods and lords, but he knew that this is what people called them. The BSB indicates this by using the word <em>so-called</em>. Some English versions use quotation marks around <em>gods</em> and <em>lords</em> to indicate this. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as indeed there are many “gods” and many “lords” (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>lords:</strong> Here this word refers to nonhuman beings that the Greeks and others at this time considered to be rulers in spiritual realms. Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>spiritual rulers</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>powerful spiritual beings</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 8:5a-b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In 5b, Paul adds a further comment about the “so-called gods” mentioned in 5a. Some English versions punctuate this with parenthesis (as the BSB). But it is also possible to use commas or whatever is most natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For even if there are so-called gods whether in heaven or on earth, there are many so-called gods and many lords,… (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Verse 5 begins with the concept of “so-called gods” and then further explains them saying they may be found in heaven or on earth and they may be called either “gods” or “lords.” It may be more natural to reorder these elements. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Many things in heaven and on earth are called gods and lords, but none of them really are gods or lords. (CEV)</p></blockquote></div>",

They had asked him whether it was acceptable for them to eat the meat of an animal that had been sacrificed to an idol. The primary context for eating such meat was at an idol’s temple. Sometimes an animal would be offered to a false god in connection with a celebration such as a birthday or wedding to seek the god’s blessing and presence at the celebration. The animal would be butchered by a priest and a portion of the meat would be burned on an altar as an offering to the false god. Some of the remaining meat would be returned to the person who offered it and could be eaten together with family or other invited guests at a private banquet room at the temple. (Some of the remaining meat might be sent to the meat market to be sold, a situation that Paul addresses in 10:25–26.)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">There were two opinions in the Corinthian church about whether this meat could be eaten by a believer in Christ. Some of the Corinthian believers, including those who wrote the letter, understood that idols were only things that people have made or imagined. They were hoping Paul would agree with them that it was acceptable to eat this meat. However, some other believers thought that it was wrong to enter a temple and eat such meat. They still believed the false gods were real and believed that eating meat offered to them in sacrifice was an act of worship or fellowship with these gods.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul agreed in this chapter that the idols worshiped at these temples were not real gods. But he did not give permission to eat this meat at their temple. Doing so might influence other believers to also eat the meat, even though they believed it was wrong. Paul asked the Corinthians believers to act in love toward these brothers rather than selfishly demanding the right to eat this meat.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In chapter 10, Paul will continue to answer the question about eating meat sacrificed to idols. He says that a believer can have no part in the worship of idols and also that demons are active in the sacrifices to idols. He also addresses the separate situations of buying and eating meat sold in the meat market and what to do when someone invites you to eat meat in their home. Before this, in chapter 9, he uses himself as an illustration of the principle he set down at the end of chapter 8 of giving up your rights in love. He had the right to be paid for his work as an apostle, but he gave up his right so that the good news of Jesus would be better accepted.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">It is good to translate this section before you decide on a heading for it. Some other possible headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul gave instructions about eating meat of/from animals that had been sacrificed to false gods</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Believers should not eat anything that causes other believers to sin</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1047008004\" data-endVerseId=\"1047008006\"><h3>Paragraph 8:4–6</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul began to write his answer to the Corinthians’ questions about eating food sacrificed to idols. In this paragraph he began by agreeing with them about several things.</p></div><h4>8:6a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:6a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>yet for us there is but one God, the Father,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>yet for us<sup>(incl)</sup> there is only one God, the Father,</p></li><li><p>But we acknowledge/worship the one true God. He is the Father <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of us all</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>yet for us there is but one God, the Father:</strong> Paul was indicating that believers believe there is only one God, and that he is the only true God. Idol worshipers would have agreed that Christians worshiped their own “god” and their own “lord,” but they would not have agreed that he was “the only God” and “the only Lord.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>yet:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>yet</em> indicates the contrast between the idol worshipers who believe in many gods and many lords and the Christians who believe there is one God and one Lord. There are different ways to indicate this contrast. (See the note about “even if” above at 8:5–6.) For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But for us (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for us:</strong> The Greek text draws attention to this contrast by moving the words <em>for us</em> to the front of the clause. Consider if it would be helpful to emphasize the words <em>for us</em> in some way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>God, the Father:</strong> <em>God, the Father</em> refers to the first person of the Trinity. In this context, it indicates that he is the father of all people because he created all things and all things were made to serve him, as is said in 8:6b-c. In some languages, it is necessary to say who a father is in relation to. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God, our<sup>(incl)</sup> Father</p></blockquote><h4>8:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>from whom all things came</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>who caused everything else to begin/exist,</p></li><li><p>He is the one who made/created everything there is.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>from whom all things came:</strong> In Greek, there are no verbs in this verse. This verse part simply says: <em>from whom all things</em>. This means that God is the one who caused everything to exist. Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who created everything (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who caused all things to be/begin</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>all things are from him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he is the source/origin of everything</p></blockquote><h4>8:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and for whom we exist.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and we<sup>(incl)</sup> live/exist for him.</p></li><li><p>Because he made/created us, we live in order to serve him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for whom we exist:</strong> In Greek, this clause does not have a verb and just says: “and we for him.” This means that “we live/exist in order to serve God.” The pronoun <em>we</em> includes Paul and all other believers.</p><h4>8:6d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:6d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And Jesus Christ is the only true/rightful Lord.</p></li><li><p>And we<sup>(incl)</sup> acknowledge/worship only one Lord/master, Jesus the Messiah,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Lord</em> is a title meaning “master.” Paul was saying that Jesus Christ is the one who has authority over all believers and even of the whole world.</p><h4>8:6e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:6e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>through whom all things came</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Through him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God the Father</span> caused everything <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in creation</span> to begin,</p></li><li><p>to whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the Father</span> gave the work of making/creating everything.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>through whom all things came:</strong> Once again in Greek, this clause does not have a verb. It says: <em>through whom all things</em>. The <em>all things</em> here are the same <em>all things</em> as in 8:6b. This means that the universe and everything in it “were created,” “came into existence,” or “began” because of what Jesus Christ did. God the Father is ruler of everything. He gave the task of creating all things to Jesus Christ. In that sense, God the Father created all things <em>through</em> Jesus. Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God the Father created all things through/by him.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God the Father caused/commanded Jesus to create everything.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">For other Scriptures about the work of God’s Son in making everything, see John 1:1–3; Colossians 1:15–17; Hebrews 1:1–3.</p><h4>8:6f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:6f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and through whom we exist.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and through him we<sup>(incl)</sup> receive life from God.</p></li><li><p>And we live only because of him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>through whom we exist:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>through whom we exist</em> has no verb. It is literally “we (emphatic) through him.” The BSB has supplied the verb <em>exist</em>. The <em>we</em> means “we believers” or “we who belong to God.” It is not certain if “we exist through him” means that we exist because Jesus created us (physical life) or that we live spiritually because Jesus saved us.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Many commentaries interpret this as a reference to spiritual life. For example, Fee says: “the Lord Christ is the divine mediator, through whom God created all things and redeemed us.” However, most English versions translate this as “exist” (physical life) or “live” (neutral). Additionally, the Greek verbless clauses <em>δι᾽ οὗ τὰ πάντα</em> ‘through whom all things’ and <em>καὶ ἡμεῖς δι᾽ αὐτοῦ</em> ‘and we through him’ seem better understood as expressing a similar sense. The same way that all things are through him (= by creation), we are through him. With support for both spiritual life and physical life, we have chosen to recommend translating in way that can include either idea.</span></span> It is recommended that you translate in a way that could be understood in either sense. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>through whom we have been given life (NLT)</p></blockquote>",

The problem is that not all believers have this knowledge. When those without this knowledge eat food sacrificed to idols, they think they are participating in rites to real gods. They know this is wrong, but being weak they are easily influenced to do it anyway. So believers who know that idols are nothing should not think only about what they have freedom to do, but rather should think about how what they do may influence other believers toward idolatry. They should not do anything that would cause another believer to do something he thinks is wrong.</p></div><h4>8:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But not everyone has this knowledge.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ But not all <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believers</span> know this.</p></li><li><p>¶ However, some <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believers</span> do not yet understand that idols are nothing.</p></li><li><p>¶ But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">remember:</span> some <span data-bnType=\"implied\">among you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> think that idols are alive and powerful.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>But</em> here introduces a contrast.

They had asked him whether it was acceptable for them to eat the meat of an animal that had been sacrificed to an idol. The primary context for eating such meat was at an idol’s temple. Sometimes an animal would be offered to a false god in connection with a celebration such as a birthday or wedding to seek the god’s blessing and presence at the celebration. The animal would be butchered by a priest and a portion of the meat would be burned on an altar as an offering to the false god. Some of the remaining meat would be returned to the person who offered it and could be eaten together with family or other invited guests at a private banquet room at the temple. (Some of the remaining meat might be sent to the meat market to be sold, a situation that Paul addresses in 10:25–26.)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">There were two opinions in the Corinthian church about whether this meat could be eaten by a believer in Christ. Some of the Corinthian believers, including those who wrote the letter, understood that idols were only things that people have made or imagined. They were hoping Paul would agree with them that it was acceptable to eat this meat. However, some other believers thought that it was wrong to enter a temple and eat such meat. They still believed the false gods were real and believed that eating meat offered to them in sacrifice was an act of worship or fellowship with these gods.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul agreed in this chapter that the idols worshiped at these temples were not real gods. But he did not give permission to eat this meat at their temple. Doing so might influence other believers to also eat the meat, even though they believed it was wrong. Paul asked the Corinthians believers to act in love toward these brothers rather than selfishly demanding the right to eat this meat.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In chapter 10, Paul will continue to answer the question about eating meat sacrificed to idols. He says that a believer can have no part in the worship of idols and also that demons are active in the sacrifices to idols. He also addresses the separate situations of buying and eating meat sold in the meat market and what to do when someone invites you to eat meat in their home. Before this, in chapter 9, he uses himself as an illustration of the principle he set down at the end of chapter 8 of giving up your rights in love. He had the right to be paid for his work as an apostle, but he gave up his right so that the good news of Jesus would be better accepted.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">It is good to translate this section before you decide on a heading for it. Some other possible headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul gave instructions about eating meat of/from animals that had been sacrificed to false gods</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Believers should not eat anything that causes other believers to sin</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1047008007\" data-endVerseId=\"1047008013\"><h3>Paragraph 8:7–13</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph Paul discussed a problem related to the knowledge that an idol is nothing. The problem is that not all believers have this knowledge. When those without this knowledge eat food sacrificed to idols, they think they are participating in rites to real gods. They know this is wrong, but being weak they are easily influenced to do it anyway. So believers who know that idols are nothing should not think only about what they have freedom to do, but rather should think about how what they do may influence other believers toward idolatry. They should not do anything that would cause another believer to do something he thinks is wrong.</p></div><h4>8:8a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:8a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But food does not bring us closer to God:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But what we<sup>(incl)</sup> eat or do not eat does not make us more acceptable to God.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I agree with you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who say that</span> our<sup>(incl)</sup> relationship with God is not based on whether we eat or do not eat certain foods.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But:</strong> There is a contrast here. The contrast is between the statement in verse 7 and the statement in 8:8a. In verse 7, the believer with a weak conscience thinks that eating food sacrificed to an idol can injure the relationship between him and God. Verse part 8a says that what we eat does not make any difference in our relationship with God. Although eating food sacrificed to idols causes these believers to have guilt before God, it is not the food itself that causes the problem. Some English versions, such as the RSV, do not explicitly translate this conjunction. Consider if it is natural for you to translate this conjunction here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>food does not bring us closer to God:</strong> Paul believed that what you eat does not make you right with God. Eating the right food does not cause God to approve of you. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>food will not bring us into God’s presence (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Food will not affect our relationship with God. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In saying this, Paul was probably agreeing with the position of the Corinthians who had written to him and asked the question about eating food offered to idols. Some English versions translate this in a way that expresses agreement with what the Corinthians had said, and you may want to do the same. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It’s true that we can’t win God’s approval by what we eat. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But of course food cannot make us acceptable to God (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>food:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>food</em> is a general word that can refer to anything that is eaten. In this verse Paul was not speaking specifically of food that had been offered to idols, or of food that was eaten in a pagan temple.</p><h4>8:8b-c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Though Paul agreed with the Corinthians who wrote the letter to him that food does not affect our relationship with God, in 8:8b-c (and the rest of the chapter) he challenges their position. They believed that not eating food offered to idols was the wrong choice. And they believed they would benefit in different ways from choosing to eat this food at the temple. Paul says the opposite. He says that people who choose not to eat this food make a good choice; they are <u>not</u> worse off. And people who choose to eat this food do not gain anything.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">These verse parts form a complementary pair. Translate them so that they match one another. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do. (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we shall not lose anything if we do not eat, nor shall we gain anything if we do eat (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Refusing to eat does not make us less pleasing to God, and eating does not make us better in God’s sight. (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>8:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>We are no worse if we do not eat,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>If we<sup>(incl)</sup> do not eat certain foods, that does not do us any harm.</p></li><li><p>We do not displease God by not eating them,</p></li><li><p>It is actually a good thing to not eat food offered to idols.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>We are no worse if we do not eat:</strong> The believers Paul mentioned in 8:7 believed that they should not eat certain foods. Paul defends them here saying that their choice was a good one. These believers did not displease God by not eating such foods. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we will not be less pleasing to God if we do not eat</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If we do not eat, that is fine. God is still pleased with us.</p></blockquote><h4>8:8c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:8c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and no better if we do.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And if we<sup>(incl)</sup> do eat those foods, that does not do us any good.</p></li><li><p>and we do not please God by eating them.</p></li><li><p>And we gain no benefit when we eat idol food.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>no better if we do:</strong> This is a short way of saying “We are no better if we do eat such foods.” Paul was continuing to address the believers who had written to him and who understood that idols are not real. They apparently thought they were pleasing God by eating idol food and so showing that they did not respect idols. Paul said that eating such foods does not please God or benefit them more than not eating them.</p>",

Paul wanted the believers to avoid a dangerous situation. They should therefore carefully consider the consequences of eating meat sacrificed to idols.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>however:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>however</em> here introduces a warning that contrasts with what Paul had just said. In 8:8a, Paul agreed that food does not affect our relationship with God, and so in principle Christians have freedom or right to eat food that had been sacrificed to idols. Starting in this verse, Paul warned the Christians to be careful how they used that freedom.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Consider what would be a natural way to connect 8:9 to 8:8 in your language. Since the point of contrast is with the first part of verse 8 (8:8a) more than the last part of the verse (8:8b-c), you may or may not want to use a conjunction that indicates contrast. Among English versions, some mark the contrast and some do not. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak. (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Don&apos;t cause problems for someone with a weak conscience, just because you have the right to eat anything. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>your freedom:</strong> The Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>your freedom</em> are more literally “this right of yours.” In some languages it may be helpful to say what this right was. The following English versions make this more explicit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the right to eat anything (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your freedom to eat meat (JBP)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>does not become a stumbling block to the weak:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>stumbling block</em> is a metaphor. It refers to a log or a stone in a road or path that causes someone to fall down. Here the “exercise of your freedom” (to eat meat offered to idols) is compared to this kind of stone or log in the path. They are similar in that they both cause someone to fall and result in hurt or harm. One causes a person to literally fall down. The other causes a person to “fall into sin” (a biblical idiom) and harms his or her relationship with God. A different Greek word with a similar meaning is used in 1:23b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If the meaning of the metaphor may be difficult to understand, some other ways this are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Change the metaphor to a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>be careful that the exercise of your freedom does not become like a log/stone that makes the weak trip/fall</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>be careful that the exercise of your freedom does not cause your brothers with weak consciences to sin</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Keep the metaphor and also make the meaning clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>be careful that the exercise of your freedom does not cause the weak to fall into sin like a log across the path makes people fall</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>be careful that the exercise of your freedom not become a stone in the way that causes the weak to fall into sin</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the weak:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>the weak</em> here refers to the people mentioned in 8:7a, those believers whose consciences were weak. You may want to make that clear in your translation.</p>",

The conditional clause states something that could possibly happen: someone sees you eating at an idol’s temple. The rhetorical question suggests what the probable result would be: the person who sees you would be emboldened to also eat meat sacrificed to an idol there. It may be more natural in your language to change the form of the conditional clause or the rhetorical question to a statement.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Ways to translate the conditional clause include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if anyone with a weak conscience sees you who have this knowledge eating in an idol’s temple (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For example, suppose someone with a weak conscience sees you, who have this knowledge, eating in the temple of a false god. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>someone who is weak in faith might see you eating there (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The rhetorical question implies the answer “Yes.” Paul used this question to suggest what was likely to happen if 8:10a were true. Ways to translate this include:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>as a rhetorical question:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>will not his conscience be emboldened to eat meat consecrated to the heathen deity? (REB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a question and supply the implied answer “yes”:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Will the person be encouraged to do what they think is wrong? Yes, he will.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a positive statement with a high degree of certainty. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>someone with a weak conscience will surely be encouraged to eat meat sacrificed to idols while thinking it wrong to do so</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>8:10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For if someone with a weak conscience sees you who are well informed eating in an idol’s temple,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For suppose a believer with a weak conscience sees you<sup>(sing)</sup> who know <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about idols</span> while you<sup>(sing)</sup> are eating <span data-bnType=\"implied\">idol food</span> in an idol’s temple.</p></li><li><p>Perhaps one of you<sup>(plur)</sup> who understands <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that idols are not real</span> may go to an idol’s place and eat food there. Then another believer who finds it hard do what is right may see you<sup>(sing)</sup> eating there.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>For</em> here introduces Paul’s reasons for warning the knowledgeable believers to be very careful about how they make use of their rights and freedoms. You should connect 8:10 to 8:9 in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>someone with a weak conscience:</strong> The Greek subject here is literally “someone/anyone.” The BSB has supplied the words <em>with a weak conscience</em> from the Greek of 8:10b.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you who are well informed:</strong> The Greek pronoun meaning <em>you</em> is singular. Paul uses the singular pronouns “someone” and <em>you</em> because he wants the Corinthians to think about an imaginary situation involving one believer with a weak conscience and one believer who believes it is permitted to eat meat offered to idols. The phrase <em>you who are well informed</em> here means “each one of you believers who knows that an idol is nothing.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>an idol’s temple:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as an <em>idol’s temple</em> refers to a building that contains something (often a statue) that people think represents a god. In Paul’s time people used to gather at an idol’s temple in order to honor the god by sacrificing animals and then eating the meat of those animals. Some ways of translating <em>an idol’s temple</em> are</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a house sacred/dedicated to an idol</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a place where people go to worship one of their gods</p></blockquote><h4>8:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>will he not be encouraged to eat food sacrificed to idols?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Don’t you<sup>(sing)</sup> think he will be encouraged to eat meat that has been sacrificed to idols?</p></li><li><p>That will surely give him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">false</span> confidence to do what he sees you<sup>(sing)</sup> doing. He will eat meat that has been offered/given to an idol <span data-bnType=\"implied\">even though he thinks it is wrong</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will he not be encouraged:</strong> The English verb phrase <em>will he not be encouraged</em> means “will he not be made bold?” The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>be encouraged</em> literally means “to be made strong to do something.” It is the same word that is used in 8:1d, where it is translated as “builds up.” Here however it is used in a bad sense. The weak believer feels strong to do something that he should not do. It is a passive verb. There are two ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>won’t he be emboldened…? (NIV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>using an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>will not this encourage him…? (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>food sacrificed to idols:</strong> The Greek word here is the same as in 8:1a. See the note there on <em>food sacrificed to idols</em> and translate it here in the same way.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 8:10a-b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to break this long sentence up into two or more sentences. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10a</sup>For example, suppose someone with a weak conscience sees you, who have this knowledge, eating in the temple of a false god. <sup>10b</sup>Won’t you be encouraging that person to eat food offered to a false god?

They had asked him whether it was acceptable for them to eat the meat of an animal that had been sacrificed to an idol. The primary context for eating such meat was at an idol’s temple. Sometimes an animal would be offered to a false god in connection with a celebration such as a birthday or wedding to seek the god’s blessing and presence at the celebration. The animal would be butchered by a priest and a portion of the meat would be burned on an altar as an offering to the false god. Some of the remaining meat would be returned to the person who offered it and could be eaten together with family or other invited guests at a private banquet room at the temple. (Some of the remaining meat might be sent to the meat market to be sold, a situation that Paul addresses in 10:25–26.)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">There were two opinions in the Corinthian church about whether this meat could be eaten by a believer in Christ. Some of the Corinthian believers, including those who wrote the letter, understood that idols were only things that people have made or imagined. They were hoping Paul would agree with them that it was acceptable to eat this meat. However, some other believers thought that it was wrong to enter a temple and eat such meat. They still believed the false gods were real and believed that eating meat offered to them in sacrifice was an act of worship or fellowship with these gods.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul agreed in this chapter that the idols worshiped at these temples were not real gods. But he did not give permission to eat this meat at their temple. Doing so might influence other believers to also eat the meat, even though they believed it was wrong. Paul asked the Corinthians believers to act in love toward these brothers rather than selfishly demanding the right to eat this meat.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In chapter 10, Paul will continue to answer the question about eating meat sacrificed to idols. He says that a believer can have no part in the worship of idols and also that demons are active in the sacrifices to idols. He also addresses the separate situations of buying and eating meat sold in the meat market and what to do when someone invites you to eat meat in their home. Before this, in chapter 9, he uses himself as an illustration of the principle he set down at the end of chapter 8 of giving up your rights in love. He had the right to be paid for his work as an apostle, but he gave up his right so that the good news of Jesus would be better accepted.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">It is good to translate this section before you decide on a heading for it. Some other possible headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul gave instructions about eating meat of/from animals that had been sacrificed to false gods</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Believers should not eat anything that causes other believers to sin</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1047008007\" data-endVerseId=\"1047008013\"><h3>Paragraph 8:7–13</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph Paul discussed a problem related to the knowledge that an idol is nothing. The problem is that not all believers have this knowledge. When those without this knowledge eat food sacrificed to idols, they think they are participating in rites to real gods. They know this is wrong, but being weak they are easily influenced to do it anyway. So believers who know that idols are nothing should not think only about what they have freedom to do, but rather should think about how what they do may influence other believers toward idolatry. They should not do anything that would cause another believer to do something he thinks is wrong.</p></div><h4>8:11</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:11\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So this weak brother, for whom Christ died, is destroyed by your knowledge.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>So by knowing so much you<sup>(sing)</sup> will ruin a weak believer, a person for whom Christ died.</p></li><li><p>In that way, you will harm/damage a believer who is weak because of what you know. And Christ died for this person.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>So</em> here introduces the result that Paul thinks will happen if a weak believer feels encouraged to do something his conscience tells him is wrong for him to do. Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In that case (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and then (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As a result</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>this weak brother…is destroyed by your knowledge:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>is destroyed</em><span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Greek word that the BSB translates as “destroyed” occurs numerous times in the New Testament. It is often translated as lose, kill, destroy or ruin. When it is used to refer to people, it usually refers to a non-Christians being lost or destroyed. In this verse, the verb refers to a Christian brother. The two most common English translations for this word are “destroy” and “ruin.” In order to help decide how to translate this word in this verse, it is useful to consider the entire chapter. The best information is found in 1 Corinthians 8:12 since it is a restatement of some of the information in verse 11. Verse 11 talks about a brother being “destroyed by your knowledge.” Verse 12 talks about “wounding their weak conscience.” Verse 7 says “their conscience is defiled,” verse 9 says, “become a stumbling block to the weak,” and verse 13 says, “causes my brother to stumble.” All of these expressions are weaker than “destroy” so when you translate this verse, it is probably better to use a weaker word like “ruin.”</span></span> means to be ruined. In this context, it probably indicates that the believer’s conscience, and as a result his spiritual life, will be harmed. This believer becomes weaker in his ability do what is right as a Christian. By eating food that was sacrificed to idols, he has begun to go back to the worship of idols.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This weak believer for whom Christ died is ruined because of your “knowledge.” (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>by your knowledge, you cause spiritual disaster to a weaker brother</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>your example/practice, based on what you know [about idols], harms/damages the faith of your weaker brother</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>is destroyed:</strong> The verb <em>is destroyed</em> is passive. In some languages, it may be more natural to translate this clause without using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And so this weak person, this brother for whom Christ died, will perish because of your knowledge. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This ‘knowledge’ of yours destroys the weak, the fellow-Christian for whom Christ died. (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>by your knowledge:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>by your knowledge</em> here means “through your knowledge” or “because of your knowledge.” Directly or indirectly, the knowledge of the strong believer destroys the weak believer. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because of your superior knowledge (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>through your knowledge (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>what you know has destroyed someone (CEV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 8:11</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">You may wish to reorder the phrases in this verse. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So because of your superior knowledge, a weak believer for whom Christ died will be destroyed. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This ‘knowledge’ of yours destroys the weak, the fellow Christian for whom Christ died. (REB)</p></blockquote></div>",

They should not do anything that would cause another believer to do something he thinks is wrong.</p></div><h4>8:12a,c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:12a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>By sinning against your brothers in this way</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>When/if you<sup>(plur)</sup> sin like that against other Christian brothers and sisters</p></li><li><p>And not only that, by doing wrong to other believers,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>By sinning against your brothers in this way…, you sin against Christ:</strong> Paul strengthens his warning against eating idol meat at the temple by saying that sinning against your Christian brothers by doing this (8:12a) is the same as sinning against Christ (8:12c). Some ways to express the relation between 8:12a and 8:12c could be:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When/if you sin against your brothers by doing those things…, you sin against Christ.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>By sinning in this way against your brothers…, you also sin against Christ.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Sinning like that against your brothers…is the same as sinning against Christ.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In 8:12, Paul states another consequence of the strong believers eating food in an idol’s temple. Not only do they cause significant spiritual harm to their Christian brothers (8:11), sinning against them in this way is the same as sinning against Christ. The words “in this way” connect the consequence stated in 8:12 to the actions described in 8:10–11. See the note below on “in this way.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>By sinning against your brothers:</strong> The believers who considered themselves strong and wise were harming other Christians. They were sinning against them in the sense that they were causing them to sin.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in this way:</strong> In Greek the word that the BSB translates as <em>in this way</em> refers back to the way in which the strong believers would harm the weak believers if they were seen eating meat offered to idols as described in 8:10–11. You may want to make the relationship between 8:11 and 8:12 clear at the beginning of 8:12 with a connecting word or phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And in this way (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Thus, sinning against your brothers… (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And so, by sinning against the brethren… (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>by doing this/that</p></blockquote><h4>8:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and wounding their weak conscience,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>by hurting/injuring/weakening their ability to know and do what is right,</p></li><li><p>and making it even harder for them to know and do what is right,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and wounding their weak conscience:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>wounding</em> literally means to strike or hit something. If what is being hit is soft and tender, the hitting causes real harm or injury. Paul used this verb here as a figure of speech to describe how a strong believer might injure other believers by making them even weaker. This happens when the actions of the strong believer cause the weak believer to do something he thinks he should not do. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>cause them to do what they think is wrong (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>hurting a follower with a weak conscience (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>8:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>you sin against Christ.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>you<sup>(plur)</sup> are also sinning against Christ himself.</p></li><li><p>you are doing wrong to Christ himself.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you sin against Christ:</strong> Paul was probably referring to what Jesus himself had said, that when anyone does something to help or hurt one who belongs to him, they are helping or hurting him also (Matthew 25:40, 25:45; Acts 9:1–5).</p>",

Paul says this to make the point that he would happily give up eating all meat if it might influence someone to do what they believed was wrong.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>what I eat:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>what I eat</em> is literally “food.” It is the general word for food that was used in 8:8a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>causes…to stumble:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>causes…to stumble</em> means much the same as “become a stumbling block to the weak” in 8:9b.

Paul would gladly give up eating meat in order <u>to avoid</u> causing someone else to sin. The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>cause…to stumble</em> is the same as in 8:13a where the BSB translates it as “causes…to stumble.” You may be able to translate it here in the same way as you translated it there.

This refers back to chapter 8. This could be expressed as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Am I not free from the law?<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>9:1 See Thiselton, Robertson and Plummer, or Lenski.</span></span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Paul was free <u>to not have to work for a living</u>. This refers forward to 9:5–12. This could be expressed as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Am I not free from working for my living?<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>9:1 See Ellington &amp; Hatton.</span></span></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is best to translate this in a way that allows for either interpretation, if possible. If you must make a choice, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This is the interpretation supported by several commentaries. The word <em>free</em> in this verse does not refer to freedom from slavery.</p><h4>9:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Am I not an apostle?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I am an apostle, am I not?</p></li><li><p>I am a messenger of Christ.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Am I not an apostle?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. Paul used it as a strong statement that expects the response “yes.” It introduces Paul’s proof that he was an apostle. He continued to make this point in 9:3–18. Here are some ways to translate this statement:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Don’t you agree that I am an apostle? (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do you think that I am not an apostle?</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a rhetorical question with its own response. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Am I not an apostle? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Of course I am.</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a strong statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Certainly, I am an apostle</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this strong statement in a way that will help readers to think about Paul’s authority and his position as an apostle.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>apostle:</strong> The word <em>apostle</em> means “a messenger.” It is someone who is sent on a mission or sent with a message. An apostle represents the people who sent him, and has their authority.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The “apostles” were the people whom Jesus sent with his authority to heal the sick, cast out evil spirits, and preach the good news of the Kingdom.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate the word <em>apostle</em>:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate the meaning of the Greek word <em>apostle</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>messenger</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>representative</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>person sent <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to speak/act for Jesus</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>person with authority <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from Jesus</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Indicate the role or function of apostles.

See for example, Matthew 10:2.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Be careful to choose different terms for <em>apostle</em>, “disciple,” “angel,” “elder,” and “prophet.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">See also the article in KBT about the term <em>apostle</em>.</p><h4>9:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Have I not seen Jesus our Lord?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I have seen Jesus our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord, have I not?</p></li><li><p>I myself have seen our Lord Jesus.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Have I not seen Jesus our Lord?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. Paul used it as a strong statement. He expected them to respond, “Yes, you have.” Here are some ways to translate this strong statement:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Haven’t I seen Jesus our Lord with my own eyes? (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a rhetorical question with its own response. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Of course I have.</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I myself have seen Jesus our Lord</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this strong statement in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">One requirement for becoming an apostle was to see Jesus after his resurrection.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>9:1 See Acts 1:21–22.</span></span> Paul saw Jesus when Jesus appeared to him on the road to Damascus. Paul told them that he had seen Jesus in order to prove to them that he was an apostle. See Acts 9:1–6; 1 Corinthians 15:8; Galatians 1:11–17.</p><h4>9:1d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:1d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Are you yourselves not my workmanship in the Lord?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Are you<sup>(plur)</sup> not the fruit of my work in the Lord?</p></li><li><p>You became followers of the Lord as a result of the work that he helped me to do, did you not?</p></li><li><p>You are my work in the Lord.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Are you yourselves not my workmanship in the Lord?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. Paul used it as a strong statement. He expected them to respond, “Yes, we are.” Here are some ways to translate this strong statement:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Aren’t you the result of my work for the Lord? (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a rhetorical question with its own response. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Are you not my workmanship in the Lord? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Of course you are.</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You are my workmanship in the Lord</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this strong statement in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The second requirement for becoming an apostle was to receive a commission from the Lord Jesus to preach the gospel. Paul received that commission, and the Corinthians believed in the Lord Jesus through his message. See Acts 22:14–15, Galatians 1:15–16, and 1 Corinthians 2:1–5. So the Corinthians believers were proof that Paul was an apostle.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>my workmanship:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>my workmanship</em> is more literally “my work.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You are the fruit of my work</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Are you not my work in the Lord? (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Isn’t it because of my work that you belong to the Lord? (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this phrase so that the meaning is clear. Paul preached the gospel and the Corinthians became believers through hearing him preach. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I…have led you to have faith in him (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in the Lord:</strong> There are three ways to interpret the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>in the Lord</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means that Paul worked <u>through the Lord</u>. The Lord enabled Paul to do this work. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>aren’t you the result of my work which the Lord helped me to do?</p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means that Paul worked <u>for the Lord</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>aren’t you the result of my work for the Lord? (GNT) <em>(GNT, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It indicates that the Corinthians were <u>in the Lord</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Isn’t it because of my work that you belong to the Lord? (NLT) <em>(NLT, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you choose interpretation (1). This is supported by several commentaries.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>9:1 See, for example, Ellington &amp; Hatton, page 193, which says, “In the Lord means in this context ‘by the Lord working through me.’”</span></span> Most English versions translate this literally and it is not clear which view they support.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 9:1a-d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may not be natural to have four short sentences in a row like this.

He used three examples from everyday life to illustrate his argument.</p></div><h4>9:5a-b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Have we no right to take along a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Cephas?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. Paul used this rhetorical question as a statement. He expected them to respond, “Yes.” He stated that he and his fellow workers had the same right as the other apostles to travel with a wife.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate this statement:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do we not have the right to bring a believing wife with us when we travel as do the other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Peter? (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We each have the right to marry one of the Lord’s followers and to take her along with us, just as the other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Peter do. (CEV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this statement in a way that is natural in your language.</p><h4>9:5a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:5a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Have we no right to take along a believing wife,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>We<sup>(excl)</sup> surely have the right to have a believing wife accompany us on our journeys, don’t we?</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">And when we travel doing the Lord’s work,</span> it is right that we can take along a Christian wife.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Have we no right to take along a believing wife…?:</strong> In this clause Paul said that he and the other apostles have the right to take a wife with them on their journeys. He implied that it was right for the churches to support this wife as well as the apostle. Consider how you translated the idea <em>Have we no right</em> in 9:4. It is good to translate it in the same way in this verse. Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it is right that we should be able to ask our believing wife to accompany us</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>May we not travel with a Christian wife (JBP)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we:</strong> The pronoun <em>we</em> is exclusive. Paul referred to himself and his fellow apostles, not to his readers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a believing wife:</strong> Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a Christian wife (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In your translation, make sure that you do not imply that an apostle brought his Christian wife from among his several other wives. In some languages it may be better to say</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a believer who is his wife</p></blockquote><h4>9:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>as do the other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Cephas?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>That is what the rest of the apostles and the Lord’s <span data-bnType=\"implied\">own</span> brothers and Peter have the right to do.</p></li><li><p>The other messengers of the Lord, including Peter and the Lord’s brothers, are able to do this.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as do the other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Cephas:</strong> There is no verb in the last part of this sentence. The BSB has supplied the verb <em>do</em>. This could mean either “do have this right” or “do take along with them.” It is best to translate this in a way that means “do have this right.” Paul was focused on his rights as an apostle. Some ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>like the other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Cephas</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This is what the other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Cephas have the right to do</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Cephas:</strong> These were not separate groups of people. The <em>Lord’s brothers</em> were probably included in the group of <em>apostles</em>, and <em>Cephas</em> certainly was. To avoid the wrong meaning that Cephas was not an apostle, it may be necessary to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the other apostles, including Cephas and the Lord’s brothers</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the Lord’s brothers:</strong> These were the younger brothers of Jesus. In some languages it may be necessary to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the Lord’s younger brothers</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Cephas:</strong> <em>Cephas</em> was the Aramaic name of Simon Peter. Some English versions say “Peter.” If you put <em>Cephas</em> in the text, you may wish to include this footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>FOOTNOTE: Cephas is another name for Simon Peter.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you put “Peter” in the text, you may wish to include this footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>FOOTNOTE: The Greek text says “Cephas,” which is the name of Peter in Aramaic.</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 9:5a-b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reverse the order of 9:5a-b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Peter take their Christian wives with them when they travel, and we<sup>(excl)</sup> have this right too.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>9:5 See Ellington &amp; Hatton, page 196.</span></span></p></blockquote></div>",

Paul used this rhetorical question as a statement. He expected them to respond, “No one.” Paul said that a person who plants a vineyard can eat some of the fruit.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate this statement:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Does anyone plant a vineyard and not eat the grapes? (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Don’t people who raise grapes eat some of what they grow? (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What farmers do not eat the grapes from their own vineyard? (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a rhetorical question with its own response. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">No one.</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No one ever plants a vineyard without eating some of the grapes. (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>vineyard:</strong> A <em>vineyard</em> is a field where people grow grapes. Grapes are a small, sweet fruit that people commonly grew in ancient Israel. They used them to make wine. The plant that grapes grow on is a vine with a woody trunk like a shrub or tree. The trunk and its branches grow along the ground unless they are supported.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to refer to a <em>vineyard</em>:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>grape farm</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>field of grape vines/plants/trees</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages there may not be a word for <em>vineyard</em> or for “grape.” If that is true in your language, here are two other options to consider:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Borrow the word for “grape” from another language and add a general expression that describes what a vineyard is. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>farm for producing <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a fruit called</span> grapes</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>field for growing/cultivating <span data-bnType=\"implied\">fruit from</span> grape <span data-bnType=\"implied\">vines</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a general word for fruit that would fit in this context. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>farm/field to produce a fruit <span data-bnType=\"implied\">used to make wine</span></p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>fruit:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>fruit</em> is a general word, but in this context it is clear that it refers specifically to “grapes” from the vineyard. So, it is possible to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>grapes (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Vineyards and grapes are spoken of figuratively in many places in the Bible. You may want to look at these other contexts as you decide how to translate these words. Here are some passages that refer to vineyards: Isaiah 5:1–7, Genesis 9:20, and Matthew 20:1. Here are some passages that refer to grapes: Genesis 40:10–11, Isaiah 5:2, and Matthew 7:16.</p><h4>9:7c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:7c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Who tends a flock and does not drink of its milk?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Don’t people who take care of sheep/goats, drink some of the milk?</p></li><li><p>And if a person raises animals, he has the right to use the milk that he gets from them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Who tends a flock and does not drink of its milk?:</strong> This is the third of three rhetorical questions in 9:7. Paul used this rhetorical question as a statement. He expected them to respond, “No one.” Paul said that people who take care of animals benefit from them by using their milk.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate this statement:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What shepherd cares for a flock of sheep and isn’t allowed to drink some of the milk? (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Don’t shepherds get milk from their own goats? (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a rhetorical question with its own response. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Who tends a flock and does not drink of the milk? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">No one.</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No person takes care of a flock without drinking some of the milk. (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this statement in a way that is most natural in your language</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>tends a flock:</strong> The phrase <em>tends a flock</em> normally refers to taking care of sheep. Many English versions use a general term like <em>flock</em>. If people in your culture use the milk of goats but not that of sheep, it is recommended that you translate it in this way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Don’t shepherds get milk from their own goats? (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>drink of its milk:</strong> If people in your culture drink the milk of cattle but not of goats or sheep, it may be necessary to make this question more general. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Don’t people drink the milk from the animals they care for?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If drinking of milk is unknown in your culture, it is possible to use a more general reference. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Doesn’t the person who cares for the animals get his share?</p></blockquote>",

In that time, after people cut the grain in the field, they brought it to a flat place and spread it out. Then they made animals such as oxen walk on it so that the seeds would separate from the stalks. If a farmer wanted to keep his animals from eating the grain, he tied their mouths shut. But the law Paul quoted said that the animals should be allowed to eat some of the grain.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions make it explicit that the purpose of muzzling is to prevent the ox from eating the grain. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You must not muzzle an ox to keep it from eating as it treads out the grain (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>treading out:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>treading out</em> is more literally “threshing.” Threshing is the process of removing the seeds from the plants.

The verb “share” is the same Greek verb used for the harvest metaphor in 9:10d. If it is natural in your language, you could use the same verb in both verses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>others share this rightful claim on you (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>others:</strong> The word <em>others</em> refers to other Christian workers. The NLT makes this explicit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>others who preach to you (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>this right to your support:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>this right to your support</em> is more literally “your right.” The BSB has added some words to make it clear what right Paul was talking about. Other ways to make this explicit include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the right to get something from you (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the right to receive physical/material things</p></blockquote><h4>9:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>shouldn’t we have it all the more?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>then don’t <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Barnabas and I</span> have a greater <span data-bnType=\"implied\">right</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to such support</span>?</p></li><li><p>so surely it is even more right/fitting <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that you should support us</span><sup>(excl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because we brought the gospel to you first</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>shouldn’t we have it all the more?:</strong> In this clause Paul claimed that he and Barnabas had a greater right to receive support than other Christian workers did. This was because Paul and Barnabas were the ones who first preached the gospel in Corinth. To make this implied information explicit you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we have an even greater right to be supported, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because we were the first to preach the good news to you</span></p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1047009012\" data-endVerseId=\"1047009014\"><h3>Paragraph 9:12c-14</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph Paul stated that he did not use his right to receive support.

Translate this in a way that makes it clear that Paul referred to the “right to your support” he mentioned in 9:12a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Yet we<sup>(excl)</sup> have never exercised <span data-bnType=\"implied\">our</span> right <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be supported/paid</span>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But we never demanded that which is right, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">should support/pay us</span>.</p></blockquote><h4>9:12d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:12d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Instead, we put up with anything</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Rather, we<sup>(excl)</sup> endure all kinds of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">difficulties</span></p></li><li><p>Instead, we<sup>(excl)</sup> are willing to accept any <span data-bnType=\"implied\">hardship</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we put up with anything:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>put up with</em> is more literally “endure” (as in the ESV). Paul and Barnabas were willing to endure hunger, and the weariness that comes from working hard for a living (see 4:11–12). Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we<sup>(excl)</sup> suffer every kind of hardship</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we are willing to accept every difficulty</p></blockquote><h4>9:12e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:12e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>rather than hinder the gospel of Christ.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to avoid hindering the gospel of Christ.</p></li><li><p>so that the good news about Christ may advance without any obstacles.</p></li><li><p>so that we<sup>(excl)</sup> will not do anything that will make it hard for people to believe the gospel of Christ.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>rather than hinder the gospel of Christ:</strong> This clause indicates the reason why Paul did not want to do anything to make it hard for the gospel to advance. He did not want to make it hard for people to receive God’s message. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in order not to put any obstacle in the way of the Good News about Christ (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to keep from causing trouble for the message about Christ (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we do not do anything that causes people to reject the gospel of Christ</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the gospel of Christ:</strong> The phrase <em>the gospel of Christ</em> means “the good news about Jesus Christ.” See how you translated the phrase <em>the gospel</em> in 1:17, and see the gospel in the glossary.</p>",

In this paragraph he further explained his choice not to make use of this right. He stated this choice in emphatic terms in v. 15. He described this choice as “my boast.” He then explained that he does not boast about the fact that he preaches the Gospel. The Lord Jesus commanded him to preach. He had no choice, he must do it. His reward for his work is the satisfaction he gets from giving up his right.</p></div><h4>9:15a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:15a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But I have not used any of these rights.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ But I have never used/claimed my right <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to support</span>.</p></li><li><p>¶ But I have never asked anything from you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But I have not used any of these rights:</strong> The Greek text says literally, “But I have not used any of these things.” The BSB has supplied the word <em>rights</em>. This repeats what he said in 9:12c: “But we did not exercise this right.” Paul said that he had not insisted that the people he preached to must support him.

This was not his purpose in writing about his rights. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>nor am I writing this now in order to claim such rights for myself (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am not writing this letter to ask you to support me.</p></blockquote><h4>9:15c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:15c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Indeed, I would rather die than let anyone nullify my boast.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It would be better to die!

Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I would rather die.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It would be better if I die <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of hunger</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>let anyone nullify my boast:</strong> After breaking off his previous sentence, Paul started again. In this sentence he said that he would not let anyone make his boast untrue, that is, he did not want anyone to give him financial support. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>lose my right to boast about preaching without charge (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>have anyone say I taught you because I wanted you to support me</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to start a new sentence here.

Paul rejoiced that he was able to preach without receiving pay. He did not sin by doing this.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>this thing that I am proud of</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>this good thing that I do</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>my right</p></blockquote>",

He described this choice as “my boast.” He then explained that he does not boast about the fact that he preaches the Gospel. The Lord Jesus commanded him to preach. He had no choice, he must do it. His reward for his work is the satisfaction he gets from giving up his right.</p></div><h4>9:16a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:16a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Yet when I preach the gospel, I have no reason to boast,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But I do not boast about <span data-bnType=\"implied\">simply</span> preaching the good news,</p></li><li><p>It is not the preaching of the gospel itself that I can boast about, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">it is giving up my right to be paid for it that I boast about</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Yet:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Yet</em> expresses a contrast. After Paul mentioned his boast in 9:15, he went on in 9:16 to say what his boast was not. These are some ways to express this connection:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use a conjunction in your language that expresses contra-expectation or contrast. Paul clarified something that he did not boast about. Many English versions use the preposition “yet.”</p></li><li><p>Use no conjunction, leaving the meaning implicit. Several English versions such as the NRSV, GNT, and CEV have no conjunction.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>when I preach the gospel, I have no reason to boast:</strong> Paul said that he did not boast about preaching the gospel. The reason was that he was compelled to preach.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>when:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>when</em> is more literally “if.” Some ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when (NIV)</p></blockquote><h4>9:16b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:16b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because I am obligated to preach.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because I am obliged to do this.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The Lord commanded me</span> to preach the gospel and I cannot refuse.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>because</em> introduces the reason why Paul could not boast about preaching the gospel. He had to preach because Christ had commanded him to preach. Other ways to introduce this reason include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>since (CEB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I am obligated to preach:</strong> In this clause Paul said that he could not boast about preaching the gospel because he had to preach. Christ had commanded him to do so. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have an obligation to do this (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am under orders to do so (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I am obligated:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>I am obligated</em> is literally “necessity is laid upon me.” This is a passive clause and the implied agent is God or Jesus. Jesus showed himself to Paul along the road to Damascus. He told Paul that he was sending him to tell people, especially Gentiles, the good news of salvation. See Acts 9:3–6, 22:12–15, 26:12–20. There are two ways to translate this passive clause:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>with a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am compelled by God. (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>with an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God told me to preach</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>9:16c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:16c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>How terrible it will be for me if I do not preach the gospel!</p></li><li><p>If I do not tell the good news, he will judge me!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">This phrase expands on the idea in 16b, using even stronger terms. The BSB does not use a conjunction to introduce this phrase. Consider how it is natural in your language to introduce a statement that adds detail and emotion.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!:</strong> This is an emotive statement, implying that the Lord would punish Paul if he did not obey him. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>How horrible it will be for me if I don’t spread the Good News! (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And how terrible it would be for me if I did not preach the gospel! (GNT)</p></blockquote>",

His reward for his work is the satisfaction he gets from giving up his right.</p></div><h4>9:17</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 9:16 Paul said that he was “compelled to preach.” In this verse he said more about that obligation with two contrastive sentences. Both are conditionals starting with the word “if.” The first sentence was not true of Paul, but the second sentence was true for Paul.</p><h4>9:17a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:17a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>If my preaching is voluntary,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>If I did this because it was my own choice,</p></li><li><p>If I myself had chosen to proclaim the good news,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>If my preaching is voluntary:</strong> The context indicates that Paul spoke of a situation that was not true for him. Preaching was not a free choice for him. He was “compelled to preach” because God had commanded it. Thus, the word <em>If</em> introduces an unfulfilled condition.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>9:17 See the GNT, REB, NJB, and NLT.</span></span> Translate this using the forms that are natural in your language for referring to a situation that is not true. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If I did it of my own choice (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If I were doing this on my own initiative (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>my preaching:</strong> The Greek expression that the BSB translates as <em>my preaching</em> is literally “I do this.” Some English versions make explicit that what Paul was doing was to preach. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>If I preach (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>If I did my work (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you make the meaning clear with a word such as “preach.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>voluntary:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>voluntary</em> can also be translated as “willing.” Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because it is my own choice (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because I choose to do it</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because I want to do it</p></blockquote><h4>9:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I have a reward.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>then I could expect to receive something in return.</p></li><li><p>then I would have the right to receive payment.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I have a reward:</strong> If the condition in 9:17a were true, then Paul would expect a reward. However, the condition in 9:17a is not true. Use a form which indicates that this situation is not real in Paul’s case. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I would have a reward</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I would deserve to get paid</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I would receive something in return</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I would be given wages</p></blockquote><h4>9:17c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:17c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But if it is not voluntary,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But because it was not my choice/decision <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to preach</span>, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">but the Lord told me to do it</span>,</p></li><li><p>But in fact, I must preach the good news,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But if it is not voluntary:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>But if it is not voluntary</em> is more literally “But if unwillingly.” The word <em>But</em> shows the contrast between the unfulfilled condition of 9:17a and the true condition of 9:17c. This was Paul’s actual situation. He did not choose to preach. He preached because the Lord told him to. Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but I preach because I must preach</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but I do it as a matter of duty (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but since I have no choice (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Like the phrase in 9:17a, this phrase in the Greek is a conditional. 9:17a describes an unfulfilled condition, a situation that is not true of Paul. 9:17c describes a true condition. It is true that Paul is doing his duty. Some ways to introduce this true condition are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>since (MSG)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if</p></blockquote><h4>9:17d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:17d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I am still entrusted with a responsibility.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I am only doing my duty/responsibility.</p></li><li><p>for <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the Lord</span> has given me this work to do.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I am still entrusted with a responsibility:</strong> The Greek clause is more literally “I have been entrusted a responsibility.” This clause explains the meaning of preaching the gospel “unwillingly” (9:17c). Paul said that his preaching was a “trust” or a <em>responsibility</em> because his task came from God. The Greek text leaves this connection implicit. Use a connector in your translation that makes the meaning clear. Some ways to translate 9:17c-d are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But I have no choice, for God has given me this sacred trust. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But I do it as a matter of duty, because God has entrusted me with this task. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a responsibility:</strong> God made Paul responsible for preaching the gospel. It was therefore his duty to do it. Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>trust (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>duty (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>what God asked me to do</p></blockquote>",

He described this choice as “my boast.” He then explained that he does not boast about the fact that he preaches the Gospel. The Lord Jesus commanded him to preach. He had no choice, he must do it. His reward for his work is the satisfaction he gets from giving up his right.</p></div><h4>9:18</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul explained in verses 9:16–17 that preaching the Gospel was not something he could boast about, nor something that he deserved to be rewarded for. In 9:18, he said what deed he considered worthy of a reward.</p><h4>9:18a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:18a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>What then is my reward?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>So, what do I get as a reward?</p></li><li><p>So, this is my reward:</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>What then is my reward?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. Paul used it to set up for the answer in 9:18b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate this rhetorical question:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So what reward do I get? (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a statement that points forward to 9:18b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My reward therefore, is this:</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>then:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>then</em> introduces the purpose of the situation described in 9:17c-d. By preaching the gospel free of charge, Paul did not make use of his rights in preaching it. This can be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>then</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>reward:</strong> This is a play on words. Paul said that his <em>reward</em> was to receive no reward. He did not use his right to receive pay. Thus, his <em>reward</em> was the satisfaction that he got from preaching the gospel without charge. Some ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>reward</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>blessing</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>pay</p></blockquote><h4>9:18b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:18b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>That in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">My reward is this:</span> the satisfaction that I get from preaching the gospel without charging for it,</p></li><li><p>I have the privilege of telling people the good news <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about Christ</span> without asking them to pay me for it.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>That in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge:</strong> This clause answers the question that Paul asked in 9:18a. Paul’s reward was his satisfaction that he could preach the gospel to others at no cost. A word such as “satisfaction” or “privilege” may help to express this meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is the privilege of preaching the Good News without charging for it. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>free of charge:</strong> Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>without charging anyone (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>freely (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>without the listeners paying for it</p></blockquote><h4>9:18c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:18c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and so not use up my rights in preaching it.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and not making use of the rights that preaching the gospel gives me.</p></li><li><p>In that way, I won’t use my right to get money from preaching the gospel.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and so not use up my rights in preaching it:</strong> This clause explains more about Paul’s reward. Paul finished the paragraph by returning to a reference to his rights.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>use up:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>use up</em> is an intensive form of the verb meaning <em>use</em>. There are two ways to interpret this verb:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means that Paul <u>did not use his right to be supported</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>without claiming my rights (GNT) <em>(GNT, NIV, NJB, REB, GW, NLT, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means that Paul <u>did not use his full rights</u>, or did not overuse (or did not abuse) his rights. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I do not use my full rights (NCV) <em>(BSB, NCV, RSV, ESV, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Paul did not say that he used some of his rights but not his full rights. Rather, he said that he completely gave up his right to be supported. He did not use this right.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>my rights:</strong> Translate this the way that you did in 9:4, 5, 6 and 12.</p>",

Paul was free and yet he made himself a slave. In the Greek text this contrast is implicit. The BSB indicates this contrast with the use of <em>Though</em>. Another way to indicate this is are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I am free and belong to no one.

Paul compared himself to a slave, but he did not become an actual slave. He wanted everyone to come to know Christ, so he acted in ways that would not hinder them. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I act like everybody’s slave</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I work like a slave for everyone</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I make myself a slave:</strong> This describes Paul’s way of life. Choose a tense form or a grammatical pattern in your language that expresses a general principle, or a habitual action. You should use this same tense or grammatical pattern for each of Paul’s statements in 9:20–23.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>9:19 Paul used the Greek aorist tense in 9:19–22. This as a “gnomic aorist” which expresses habitual action.

Paul acted as he did <em>for the sake of the gospel</em>, that is, in order that people would believe the good news. Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I do all these things in order that more people will believe the message about Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I behave like this so that those who believe in the good news will increase</p></blockquote><h4>9:23b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:23b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that I may share in its blessings.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that I can be among those who receive the blessings <span data-bnType=\"implied\">it offers</span>.</p></li><li><p>so that I, together with them, will receive the good things that are promised in that good news.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>share in its blessings:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>share in its blessings</em> is more literally “become a sharer in it.” In this context, <em>share</em> means to receive the same things as others. This is a purpose clause. Paul wanted to be among those who receive the good things that Christ gives us through the gospel.

Corinth was the site of the Isthmian Games which happened every two years. Athletes and spectators from all over Greece came to this athletic contest. Paul used an extended metaphor that compared living the Christian life to competing in the Games. He compared the Christian life to running and to boxing.</p></div><h4>9:24a-b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way as to take the prize:</strong> This is a metaphor that compares running in a race to the way a follower of Jesus should live and act.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul began the metaphor by asking a rhetorical question. He expected the response “Yes, we know that.” Paul asked them to think about something that they all knew and agreed about. Then on the basis of what they knew about runners, Paul exhorted them, with an element of rebuke, to live or act in a similar way.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate this rhetorical question:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do you not realize that, though all the runners in the stadium take part in the race, only one of them gets the prize?

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Everyone in a race runs, but surely you know that there is only one winner</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We all know that in a race only one runner gets the prize</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this rhetorical question in the most natural way in your language.</p><h4>9:24a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:24a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Surely you<sup>(plur)</sup> know that when people take part in a race, all of them run, but only one receives the prize.</p></li><li><p>¶ Think about this: All the competitors run on the race track, but there is only one person who wins.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in a race:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>a race</em> is literally “a stadium.” This is a reference to the Isthmian Games athletic contest, like the Olympic Games, that was held near Corinth every two years. The events in the games included running races in the stadium. Other ways to translate <em>in a race</em> include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in the arena</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>on the race course</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>at the games (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It may be helpful to include a footnote to explain this. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>FOOTNOTE: Every two years there were athletic games in Corinth, similar to the Olympic Games. Competitors and spectators from all over Greece came to these games. These games included races, boxing, and other sports.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the prize:</strong> In Paul’s time <em>the prize</em> was a crown made of leaves. It may be helpful to include a footnote to explain this. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>FOOTNOTE: At the sports games in Corinth the prize for the winner was a crown made of leaves.</p></blockquote><h4>9:24b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:24b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Run in such a way as to take the prize.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You<sup>(plur)</sup> should run in the way that will win you the prize.</p></li><li><p>So, just as runners run to win, you should live your life to get God’s prize.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Run in such a way as to take the prize:</strong> This is a metaphor that compares running a race to the Christian life. Some ways they are similar are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>There is the hope of a prize or reward to those who do well.</p></li><li><p>Both require self-discipline, training, and effort to do well.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Runners train with self-discipline, and then run with great effort in order to win the prize. Every believer should live with the same kind of effort and self-discipline in order to receive a reward from God. Some ways to translate this include:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>keep the metaphor of the race:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So run to win! (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Just like they do, run hard enough to get the prize!</p></blockquote></li><li><p>keep the metaphor and make it clear that Paul compared this to the Christian life:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So just as they run to win, you too should act/live in a way to gain God’s prize!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Living for Christ is like running a race—make every effort to win God’s reward!</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in such a way as to take the prize:</strong> This phrase does not say that only one person will receive the prize. Paul hoped that all his readers would receive the prize. In your translation, avoid suggesting that only one person will receive a reward from God. Also avoid suggesting that one person will win by beating others or doing better than others. Some ways to do this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>only one gets the prize. Run in such a way that you may <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all/each</span> receive a/the prize.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>However only one gets the award.

Other ways to say this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that I myself will not be disqualified (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to keep myself from being disqualified (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>9:27b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:27b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that after I have preached to others,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that, after preaching the gospel to others,</p></li><li><p>I do not want to preach to others <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so that they can receive God’s blessings,</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>after I have preached to others:</strong> The word <em>preached</em> means to proclaim something, or to do the work of a herald. This word is used in 1:23 and 15:11 of proclaiming the gospel about Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are two ways to interpret the use of the word <em>preached</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means to <u>preach the gospel</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>after I have spread the Good News to others (GW) <em>(BSB, GW, NIV, KJV, RSV, NASB, NET, REB, ESV, NCV, CEV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means to <u>announce an athletic contest</u>. It continues the metaphor of 9:24–26. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>after having called others to the contest (GNT) <em>(GNT, NJB, LB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This is the usual meaning of the word in the New Testament. In some languages it may be necessary to say what Paul preached or proclaimed. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>after I have preached <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the gospel</span> to others</p></blockquote><h4>9:27c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:27c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I myself will not be disqualified.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I myself will not fail to win <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the prize/reward.</span></p></li><li><p>and yet myself fail <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to receive God’s blessings</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I myself will not be disqualified:</strong> This phrase continues to use the metaphor of an athletic contest. Sometimes a runner was successful in the competition but at the end the umpire said that he had broken the rules. He was disqualified and did not receive a prize.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul did not explain what it was he would lose. It is recommended that you do not try to make this explicit. However, if you must suggest the meaning, your interpretation should agree with what you chose in 9:25c. Here, as there, it is recommended that you choose interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I might be the one whom God will not reward in the future</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I myself do not get God’s blessings</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 9:27b-c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reverse the order of 9:27b-c. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that <sup>9c</sup>I myself will not be disqualified <sup>9b</sup>after I have preached to others (NCV)</p></blockquote></div>",

First he warned them (10:1–13). He used examples from the Old Testament to show them their danger. Then he commanded them (10:14–22). He said that no one can take part in both the Lord’s Supper and idol feasts. He said that believers are free to eat meat sold in the market place unless this will hurt someone else’s conscience (10:23–30). In summary, he said that believers should control their behavior in two ways. They should praise God in everything they do, and they should not allow their actions to harm another person (10:31–11:1).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other possible section headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Don’t worship idols</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do everything for the glory of God</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1047010001\" data-endVerseId=\"1047010005\"><h3>Paragraph 10:1–5</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul gave an example of the Hebrew ancestors.

There is a loose connection between this section and the previous section. Paul finished the previous section with a paragraph about self-control. In this paragraph he explained the importance of self-control. Some English versions, including the BSB, RSV, and GNT, do not translate this conjunction explicitly. Other English versions, including the NIV, ESV, and NASB, use the word “for.” Consider if it is natural in your language to introduce this new section and paragraph with a conjunction.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I do not want you to be unaware:</strong> The Corinthians probably knew some Jewish history. Paul wanted them to remember this history and understand the lessons that it taught.

Some English versions do not translate this conjunction. Translate it in a way that makes the transition natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>these things happened to them as examples:</strong> The words <em>these things</em> refer back to the events that Paul just mentioned. God allowed those things to happen to the Hebrew people so that we would have warning examples.

If you use an active verb and provide a subject, you may need to supply the information that Moses wrote these narratives.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as warnings for us:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>warnings</em> can also be translated as “instruction.” The stories Paul mentioned give us instruction about what people should <u>not</u> do.

Paul and his readers lived in the last age of the world before God will bring his goal to an end.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are at least two ways to translate this phrase:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Emphasize the idea of conclusion, that this is the last age.

This is the age in which God fulfills his plan. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we live in a time when all these things of the past have reached their goal (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we have reached the time when all things will be complete</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">It is good if your translation can include both these ideas.

In the Greek it is two separate questions, as in the NASB:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What do I mean then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The second of these questions consists of two clauses that could be translated as separate questions. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What do I mean then? Is food sacrificed to idols anything? Is an idol anything?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Use the number of questions and sentences that are natural in your language.

Paul used it as a statement. He expected people to respond “No, of course not. That is not what you are suggesting.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are two ways to translate this statement:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a rhetorical question or questions. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What am I suggesting, then? Do I mean that food sacrificed to idols is anything?</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a statement.

See also the notes on 8:4b. Some believers argued that eating meals in an idol’s temple did not affect their standing with God. Paul agreed with them that idol food is in itself no different from any other food.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Am I suggesting, then, that:</strong> These words introduce the rhetorical question that follows.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate these words:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Am I saying that…? (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>What am I trying to say? (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>What I am trying to say is…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>food sacrificed to an idol is anything:</strong> Paul said that food sacrificed to an idol had no value or importance. It was not the means of fellowship with a god.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the food sacrificed to an idol does not have any value/worth</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the meat people sacrifice to idols is not holy</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the food sacrificed to idols is not different from other food</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>food sacrificed to an idol:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>food sacrificed to an idol</em> is the same word that is used in 8:1a and 8:4a. It refers to food that pagans dedicated to their idols. The BSB uses the passive verb <em>sacrificed</em>. If you need to use an active verb form, try to provide a general subject.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>food that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people/they</span> sacrifice to idols</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>idol food</p></blockquote><h4>10:19b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:19b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>or that an idol is anything?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I do not mean</span> that an idol has any value/worth.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am not saying</span> that an idol is an actual god.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>or:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>or</em> introduces a second thing that Paul did not mean. Consider whether to start a new sentence here, as discussed in the note on 10:19a-b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do I mean that an idol is anything?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that an idol is anything?:</strong> This is a short way of saying “do I mean that an idol is anything?” This is a rhetorical question. It functions as a statement that expects the response “No.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are two ways to translate this statement:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do I mean to say that idols are anything?</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Idols are not anything.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>an idol is anything:</strong> Paul said that an idol had no value or importance. It was not a living deity as the worshipers thought it was. See also the notes on 8:4b, “an idol is nothing at all.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Idols are not important/valuable/useful.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Idols are not alive/powerful/divine.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>An idol is not an actual god.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>An idol is just something that people have made.</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 10:19a-b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Some translators find that it is clearer to mention the idols first and then the sacrifices. It is also possible to combine these two questions. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do I mean to say that idols are alive? Is there is a difference between food offered to them and other food?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The idols which people worship are not important, and the food offered to idols is just plain food.</p></blockquote></div>",

Are we stronger than He?:</strong> This paragraph began with the command “Flee from idolatry.” It ends with this warning that God will punish the Corinthians if they ignore his command. This is Paul’s final response to their question about taking part in feasts at an idol’s temple (see 1 Corinthians 8:4).</p><h4>10:22a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:22a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Are we trying to provoke the Lord to jealousy?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Should we<sup>(incl)</sup> not be afraid to make the Lord jealous <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by worshiping someone besides himself</span>?</p></li><li><p>It is not good if the Lord becomes angry with us.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Are we trying to provoke the Lord to jealousy?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question.

He said that no one can take part in both the Lord’s Supper and idol feasts. He said that believers are free to eat meat sold in the market place unless this will hurt someone else’s conscience (10:23–30).

It does not say who allows everything. The implied subject is probably “the law” or “God.” See the notes on 6:12a where there is a similar saying.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is probably something that Paul himself had previously said. Now, some of the believers in Corinth used this phrase to claim that they could go to feasts in an idol’s temple. Many English versions, like the BSB, use quotation marks to indicate that this is a quotation. People who listen to scripture will not see the quotation marks. So, it may be helpful to supply a phrase such as “you say.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Some of you say, “We can do whatever we want to!” (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>“We are allowed to do anything,” so they say.

Now he said why he did not agree completely: some things are not helpful. They are harmful to God’s glory or to people’s spiritual life. See the notes on 6:12b. These are the same words that are used there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>maybe so, but not everything does good (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>yes, but not everything is useful</p></blockquote><h4>10:23c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:23c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Everything is permissible,”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Some of you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">say,</span> “We<sup>(incl)</sup> are allowed to do anything we want to.”</p></li><li><p>“Nothing is forbidden to us,” <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people say</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Everything is permissible:</strong> This is the same statement as in 10:23a.

(NLT96)</p></blockquote></div><h4>10:29b-10:30</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">There is an interpretation issue here. It is not clear whether the questions in these verses are Paul’s own or those of someone else. The two main options are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p><u>These are Paul’s own rhetorical questions</u>. He asked his readers to think about whether anyone should condemn him for doing something he was free to do. His questions imply the response, “This is wrong.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For why should my liberty be subject to the judgment of someone else’s conscience? If I partake with thankfulness, why should I be denounced because of that for which I give thanks? (NRSV) <em>(BSB, NRSV, NIV, NJB, KJV, NASB, RSV, NET, GW, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p><u>Paul quoted an objection by some of the Corinthians</u>. These objectors wanted to guard their rights without thinking properly about their influence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“Well, then,” someone says, “why should my freedom to act be limited by another person’s conscience? If I thank God for my food, why should anyone criticize me about food for which I give thanks?” (GNT) <em>(GNT, REB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). The reason is that if this were an objector, Paul would respond to this objection in the following verses. But he did not do so. Also, the conjunction that the BSB translates as “For” normally introduces the reason for something, not an objection.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">These questions should be understood as Paul’s own. They present a problem he wanted the Corinthians to think about. He pointed out that it was not beneficial to eat meat if it caused someone else to judge and condemn him. These questions also function as an explanation as to why the believer should not eat this food.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Thiselton, pages 788–793, discusses the different ways these verses have been understood. He refers to the rhetorical questions as part of “deliberative rhetoric.” He says, “The questions answer themselves because…they sum up the thrust of the three chapters [chaps 8–10], namely, that while believers are free, concern for the well-being of the other has priority over everything else.” Fee, page 486, footnote 52, also discusses several possible interpretations of these verse parts, while saying that “none of them is fully satisfactory.”</span></span></p><h4>10:29b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:29b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For why should my freedom be determined by someone else’s conscience?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For why should another person judge my free act <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be wrong</span> because they think it is wrong?</p></li><li><p>When I am free to eat something, there is no reason/justification for another person to condemn me when I eat it. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I should not let that happen.</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>For</em> introduces an explanation. See interpretation (1) above. It introduces Paul’s explanation of why a believer should sometimes refrain from doing something he was free to do. Some English versions such as the NJB do not have a conjunction. Consider how it is natural to introduce this in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>why should my freedom be determined by someone else’s conscience?:</strong> This is the first of two rhetorical questions. Paul used it to encourage people to think about a problem. It is not good that a believer’s freedom should be judged (and condemned) by somebody else’s conscience. Paul encouraged his readers to consider how to avoid this happening. They could avoid it by refraining from eating meat that people told them was offered to idols.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are two ways to translate this statement:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>why is my right being judged by another’s conscience? (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a statement.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>being judged by another’s conscience (NET) <em>(NET, NIV, NASB, GW, NCV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>to be limited or restricted</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>be limited by what someone else thinks (NLT) <em>(BSB, NLT, ESV, CEV, GNT, NJB, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This fits with the context of the following verse, where the person exercising freedom to eat is said to be “denounced.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The verb “be judged” is passive. The person who is judging is the “another” mentioned in the verse, or the other man’s “conscience.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are two ways to translate this passive verb:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>be judged (GW)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active verb.

Paul said that he should not be judged for doing something he was free to do, something for which he thanked God. But his implied conclusion was that he should refrain from doing something that might lead to such judgment. He could not control other people judging him. But he could use his freedom to refrain from those actions that will cause them to judge and condemn him. It may be difficult to follow Paul’s argument. It is suggested that you translate the questions in a way that makes it clear that Paul asked the believers to think about the problem. To make the meaning clear, you may need to supply some implied information:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>29b</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I should not act in a way</span> that causes someone else to judge me for doing something I am free to do. <sup>30b</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I should not eat food that allows</span> people to denounce me <sup>30a</sup>for eating something for which I have thanked God.</p></blockquote><h5><strong>General Comment on 10:29b-30</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In these questions Paul said “I.” He used himself as an example of a believer. This may make your readers think that Paul referred to himself alone. It may be clearer to use an inclusive plural pronoun “we.”</p></div>",

It is a figure of speech which refers to a person who is prominent in some way.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Thiselton says that “head” has “several nuances,” and is “a polymorphous concept” (p. 820). Paul “deliberately introduced a word that was polymorphous…Neither ‘headship,’ nor ‘order,’ nor ‘equality’ alone conveys the complexity of Paul’s theology. Again, multiple meaning holds the key.” (p. 822). Garland, p. 516, writes that the best option is to understand “head” as “that which is prominent, foremost, uppermost pre-eminent. To be ‘head’ of a group of people simply means to <em>occupy the position at the top or front</em>.”</span></span> There are three ways to interpret the word “head”:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Paul referred to someone who is <u>in a position of authority</u>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For the view that Paul was talking about authority, see Grudem, “Does KEFALE Mean ‘Source’ or ‘Authority Over’ in Greek Literature?” Trinity Journal 6 (1985): 38–59.</span></span> This could be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ is the leader of every man</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Paul referred to someone who is <u>the source of the other person</u>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See the following commentators for the view that Paul was talking about source or origin: Fee, p. 503, Barrett, p. 248.</span></span> This could be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ is the source of every man</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Every man comes from Christ</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Paul referred to someone who is <u>first in order, responsibility, role, or honor</u>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This is Thiselton’s preferred emphasis; p. 821. See also Witherington, pp. 236–38 for a similarly nuanced position.</span></span> This could be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ is first before every man</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">The commentaries do not agree as to which of these concepts was uppermost in Paul’s mind. It is recommended that you use the word “head” in your language. This is especially valuable if “head” can be interpreted as having more than one of the above meanings.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some ways to translate this concept:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ is the head of every man</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ is like the head of every man</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">If a literal rendering as “head” is not meaningful in your language, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). More commentaries accept this interpretation than the others, and translations in many minority languages around the world have found this acceptable.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages there may be a different figure of speech that can substitute for “head” which maintains some of the meanings that Paul intended.</p><h4>11:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the head of every man is Christ,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Christ is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> the head of every man,</p></li><li><p>Christ is the leader of all men</p></li><li><p>Christ’s position is above that of all men,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the head of every man is Christ:</strong> The word <em>head</em> is used as a figure of speech to refer to someone who is prominent in some way. See the discussion above at 11:3b-d about the meaning of <em>head</em>. There are three ways to translate this figure of speech:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ is the head of every man</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the figure of speech and include the word “like” to make it clear that this is a comparison.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the head of a woman is her husband (GNT) <em>(GNT, ESV, RSV, GW, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This is followed by most English versions and by most commentaries. The Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>woman</em> and <em>man</em> are in the singular. However, in verses 3–15 they are general statements that apply to all women and all men. Use a form in your language that is understood as a general statement.In Paul’s culture, a woman’s position or status in society was lower than that of a man. You should translate the words <em>woman</em> and <em>man</em> the same way throughout verses 3–15.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate these words:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all females…all males</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>women…men</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all women…all men</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the leaders of men are women</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>men are in a position above women</p></blockquote><h4>11:3d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:3d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and the head of Christ is God.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and God is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> the head of Christ.</p></li><li><p>and God is the leader of Christ.</p></li><li><p>and God has a position above Christ.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and the head of Christ is God:</strong> The word <em>head</em> is used as a figure of speech.

He said that he did not approve of a woman worshiping with her head uncovered, and he did not approve of a woman having her hair cut off either. He assumed that his readers would understand that a woman would be ashamed to have her hair cut off. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>she might as well cut her hair (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>cut off:</strong> The verb <em>cut off</em> can also be translated as “cut short.”</p><h4>11:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But since it is shameful for a woman to cut her hair short or shave her head,</p></li><li><p>Because cutting or shaving their hair takes away from women’s honor,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And:</strong> The conjunction <em>And</em> introduces another link in Paul’s argument. Because there is a certain contrast in the argument, the RSV translates it as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Consider how it is most natural in your language to connect these points in the argument.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off:</strong> Paul implied that this was shameful for a woman. In some languages it may be more natural to translate the word <em>if</em> as “because.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because it is a shameful thing</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>since it is a shameful thing</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It is important to translate <em>if</em> as “because” when readers may be in doubt as to whether or not it was a disgrace for a woman to have short hair.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>cut or shaved off:</strong> To <em>cut</em> one’s hair refers to cutting one’s hair short.

The <em>image</em> of God consists of qualities such as: the ability to reason, love, appreciate and create beauty, and to choose what is good. However, it is best not to make this explicit in the translation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>men were created to be like God (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God created men to be like him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>man is a picture of God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he is the…glory of God:</strong> There are at least two ways to interpret the clause <em>he is the…glory of God</em>.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><u>Men reflect or display the nature and greatness of God</u>. When we look at men, we see God’s glory. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>since he…reflects God’s glory (NJB) <em>(NJB, GNT, NRSV, REB)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Several English versions retain the expression “he (man) is the…glory of God” so that the meaning they follow is not clear (BSB, NIV, RSV, GW, NET, NASB, NCV, NLT).</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li><li><p><u>Men bring glory to God</u>; God receives honor through men. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>[men were created…] to bring honor to God (CEV)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is probable that Paul had both of these meanings in mind. They are not totally different or separate. Men are able to bring God glory and honor because they are made in the image of God and reflect God’s nature. You should try to translate this in a way that does not exclude either aspect of the meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you must choose between the interpretations, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).

God created woman from man, so she reflects the glory of man.

The BSB has added the phrase <em>a sign</em>. Most English versions understand this to be the head covering, which is a sign or symbol of authority. The NLT makes this explicit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So a woman should wear a covering on her head as a sign of authority. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">There are two ways to interpret whose authority this is:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is a sign of <u>the woman’s own authority</u>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Ellingworth and Hatton, p. 248; Barrett, p. 255; Robertson and Plummer, p. 232; Fee, p 520; Thiselton, p. 839.</span></span> The head covering was a sign that the woman had authority to pray and prophesy in church. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as a sign of her authority (CEV) <em>(CEV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is a sign of <u>the authority of someone else over the woman</u>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Charles Hodge, p. 211 (first pub 1857); Lenski.</span></span> The head covering was a sign that the woman was submissive and subordinate to the authority of another. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to show she is under someone’s authority (GW) <em>(GW, GNT, NJB)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The following versions do not say whose authority Paul referred to: BSB, NIV, ESV, NCV, NLT, NET, KJV, NASB, and RSV. The RSV appears to understand the word “authority” as a figure of speech referring to a veil. It is also possible that the RSV is following a few Greek texts that say “veil.” However, the reading “authority” has an A rating in the 4th edition of the UBS Greek New Testament, indicating that the text is considered certain.</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The idea that woman has her own authority connects well with 11:11a. The idea that man has authority over her connects well with 11:8–9.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that, if possible, you translate this literally and leave the interpretation open. If you must be specific, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Recent commentators favor this interpretation because in other Greek literature the phrase “have authority” refers to exercising authority. It is never said that a person “has authority” when someone else has authority over him or her.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the woman ought to have a covering on her head, to show that she has the authority to pray and prophecy</p></blockquote><h4>11:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because of the angels.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>out of regard for the angels.</p></li><li><p>because the angels are watching.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because of the angels:</strong> Commentators are not sure why Paul mentioned the angels.

Because of this, Christian women should dress and act appropriately during times of worship.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>out of regard for the angels</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because the angels are watching</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because of the angels who see</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 11:10a-b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek text the phrase “because of the angels” occurs at the end of 11:10, as in the BSB. However, it may be more natural in your language to mention first both reasons why a woman should have a sign of authority on her head. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For this reason, and because of the angels, the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head. (NIV)</p></blockquote></div>",

Several English versions use “and,” leaving the contrast implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>One is hungry and another becomes drunk.

It does not introduce an alternative problem. In some languages it may be more natural to translate this word as “and” or to leave it implicit.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>do you despise the church of God…?:</strong> The phrase <em>despise the church of God</em> means to look down on the church and consider it to be of little importance. Some people thought that eating and drinking for their own pleasure was more important than celebrating the Lord’s Supper with other believers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The question <em>do you despise the church of God?</em> is a rhetorical question. Paul used it as a rebuke. He rebuked the Corinthians for their attitude toward the church.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate this rebuke:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do you hate God’s church?

Paul expressed his disappointment and frustration.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Thiselton, p. 543 calls this a deliberative subjunctive.</span></span> Actually, Paul was not uncertain about what he should say. If a question conveys this wrong meaning, you may need to remove the question form. Translate with a phrase that is a natural way to introduce criticism. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now listen to what I say.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">There may be an idiom that you could use to express strong emotion. For example, in English one could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Words fail me at this point.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I am at a loss for words.</p></blockquote><h4>11:22e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:22e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Shall I praise you for this?

Not at all!</p></li><li><p>I certainly can give you no praise for this.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Shall I praise you for this? No, I will not!:</strong> This is a rhetorical question to which Paul supplies his own answer. If such a question and response are not natural in your language, it may be necessary to translate this as one emphatic statement:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I shall certainly not praise you<sup>(plur)</sup> for this.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This is something I cannot praise you for!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>praise:</strong> The Greek word for <em>praise</em> is the same as in 11:2a and 11:17a.

People traditionally drank a cup of wine at the end of a Passover meal. At the end of the meal Jesus picked up the cup filled with wine that was on the table.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The words <em>He took</em> are not in the Greek text.

The cup of wine was a symbol of the agreement that God made with people through the death of Jesus.

It does not mean that the Spirit gives this ability to only one person. It is a different word from that translated as <em>to another</em> in 12:8b, but in this context it means the same thing.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to another person</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to some other people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to others of us<sup>(incl)</sup></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>faith:</strong> The word <em>faith</em> refers to great belief in God. In some languages it may be natural to translate it as a verb phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he helps them to believe firmly/strongly</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he helps them to trust him very much</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by the same Spirit:</strong> The Greek preposition that the BSB translates as <em>by</em> means the same as the prepositions translated as “through” and “by” in 12:8a and 12:8b. Paul used different Greek words for good style, but they have the same meaning. If in your language it is natural to use the same word, it is fine to translate it in that way.</p><h4>12:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Some people are given, through that one Spirit <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the ability</span> to heal <span data-bnType=\"implied\">diseases</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He gives</span> some of us, through that same Spirit, gifts that help/permit us to heal <span data-bnType=\"implied\">sick people</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to another:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>to another</em>, here and four times in 12:10, is the same as in 12:8b. The variation from 12:9a is a matter of style, and you may use the same or a different word here, as is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>gifts of healing:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>gifts of healing</em> is literally “gifts of healings.” The nouns are in the plural because God gives this gift at different times in order to heal different diseases.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to translate <em>healing</em> as a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>abilities to heal <span data-bnType=\"implied\">diseases/sick people</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by that one Spirit:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>by that one Spirit</em> means the same as “by the same Spirit” in 12:9a.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some Greek manuscripts read “by the <u>same</u> Spirit” in 12:9b. This reading is followed by the KJV. The 4th edition of the UBS Greek text gives the reading “by the one Spirit” an A rating, meaning that the text is considered certain.</span></span></p>",

The first two (12:12a-b) makes a statement about the human body, and the third (12:12c) introduces the comparison. Some other English versions put the comparison with Christ at the beginning of the verse. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ is like a single body, which has many parts; it is still one body, even though it is made up of different parts.

Consider if this is natural style in your language.

The reason is that the same Spirit baptized them and made them one.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are two ways to interpret the word <em>baptized</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to a <u>spiritual baptism</u> that took place when the Corinthians became Christians, and they received the Holy Spirit.</p></li><li><p>It refers to <u>water baptism</u>.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">For the Corinthian believers, baptism in water was associated with Spirit baptism.

Paul began to talk about the church as a whole, which is Christ’s body. In some languages it may be helpful to make it clear that Paul referred to the believers as a group.

There are two conditions followed by the result that will come if the conditions are true. The first condition is that he speaks in the tongues of men and of angels, and the second condition is that he does not have love. The result is that he is like a ringing gong or a clanging cymbal.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>If…but…I am…:</strong> The BSB introduces the first condition with the word <em>If</em>, and introduces the words “do not have love” with the word <em>but</em>. These two phrases are in contrast. The BSB does not use a conjunction to introduce the result.

The GNT supplies different words to indicate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>my speech is <u>no more than</u> a noisy gong or a clanging bell (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>ringing:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>ringing</em> means “loud,” or “noisy.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>gong:</strong> A <em>gong</em> is a metal object that a person hits to produce a loud sound. A gong does not have a clear musical pitch.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>clanging:</strong> Paul talked about noises that are not pleasant to listen to. In some languages there may be a word that imitates harsh sounds. The same word is used in Mark 5:38 .</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a noisy cymbal</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a noisy for nothing cymbal</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a cymbal that they hit randomly</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a cymbal that makes a sound “grank-grank”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>cymbal:</strong> A <em>cymbal</em> is a musical instrument made of metal in the shape of a shallow dish. The musician hits two cymbals together to produce a loud sound. If people where you live do not know about cymbals, you may need to substitute a similar instrument, such as a bell.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 13:1a-b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to break up this verse into shorter sentences.

Without love the spiritual gifts are worthless.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Each verse in this paragraph has the same structure. Each has some conditions, followed by the words “but do not have love,” followed by the thing that will result if the conditions are true.</p></div><h4>13:3a–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek, this verse starts with a conjunction that the BSB does not translate. Some English versions translate it as “And.” It introduces examples of how personal sacrifices are worthless without love.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>If…and…but…I gain…:</strong> The BSB introduces two conditions with the words <em>If</em> and <em>and</em>. It introduces “have not love” with the word <em>but</em>. The BSB does not use a conjunction to introduce the result. Think about the conjunctions that will be clear in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate these conjunctions:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if…and if…but…then I gain…</p></blockquote><h4>13:3a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"13:3a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>If I give all I possess to the poor</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I may give all my belongings to poor people,</p></li><li><p>Somebody may give everything they have to others,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>If I give all I possess to the poor:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>I give all I possess to the poor</em> is more literally “I distribute all my belongings.” The BSB added the words <em>the poor</em> to make the meaning clear.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I give away everything I have</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I give all I have to poor people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I give all my possessions to help/feed poor people</p></blockquote><h4>13:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"13:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and exult in the surrender of my body,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and allow people to kill me by burning my body.</p></li><li><p>and they may be willing to be burnt to death <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for Christ</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and:</strong> In Greek, this phrase starts with two conjunctions. The BSB translates them as <em>and</em>. Some English versions translate them as “and if.” These conjunctions introduce a second personal sacrifice that a person might make.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>exult in the surrender of my body:</strong> There is a textual issue here.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some Greek manuscripts say “surrender my body <u>to the flames</u>.”</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I allow my body to be burned</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I allow them to kill me by burning my body</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I am willing to be burnt to death <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for Christ</span> <em>(NIV84, RSV, NJB, ESV, GNT, GW, REB, KJV)</em></p></blockquote><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some Greek manuscripts say “surrender my body <u>that I may boast</u>.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>give over my body to hardship, that I may boast (NIV11) <em>(BSB, NIV11, NRSV, NLT, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1). This is supported by many ancient manuscripts, and many English versions and commentaries. It is the second reading of the UBS Greek text.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The 4th edition of the UBS Greek New Testament chooses the reading “that I may boast.” However, they give it a rating of “C,” indicating that “the Committee had difficulty in deciding which variant to place in the text.”</span></span></p><h4>13:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"13:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but have not love,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But if I do not love <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other people</span>,</p></li><li><p>But if that person does not have a heart of love,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but have not love:</strong> This phrase is the same as in 13:1b and 13:2d.

But if I don’t have love, none of these things will help me. (GW)</p></blockquote><h5><strong>General Comment on 13:1–3</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph Paul wrote in the first person. He used himself as an example of any Christian. In some languages it may be natural to use “somebody” or “we” rather than “I” in order to show that Paul spoke of a general situation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If someone speaks in the tongues of men and of angels but has no love, he is a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. And if he has the gift of prophecy…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If we<sup>(incl)</sup> speak in the tongues of men and of angels but have no love, we<sup>(incl)</sup> are like noisy gongs or clanging cymbals. And if we<sup>(incl)</sup> have the gift of prophecy…</p></blockquote></div>",

He wrote as though love is a person who behaves in certain ways. In some languages it may not be possible to say that an abstract idea like love does things. The notes and the meaning lines in the Display suggest some ways to remove this personification if it is necessary.</p></div><h4>13:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"13:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>It bears all things, believes all things</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Love endures anything. Love trusts the people it loves.</p></li><li><p>If we love <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other people</span>, we are willing to endure <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all their faults patiently</span>. We remain loyal to them in every situation.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>It bears all things:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>bears</em> comes from a word meaning “roof.” Its exact meaning is not certain. There are two main ways to interpret its meaning:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>to endure</u> or bear the failings of others. People who love others continue to love them when they disappoint them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Love bears all things (RSV) <em>(BSB, RSV, NJB, NASB, ESV, NET, NLT, GNT, GW, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>to protect</u>, as a roof protects those under it. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It always protects (NIV)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This is followed by most commentaries<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See for example Fee p. 640.</span></span> and versions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Love never gives up (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Love puts up with all difficulties</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Love endures other people’s faults</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>bears all things:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>all things</em> refers to all types of circumstances. It indicates that there are no limits to what a loving person can endure.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in everything</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>believes all things:</strong> The verb <em>believes</em> refers to trusting the person you love. This does not mean that a loving person is gullible or easily tricked. Instead, one who loves is loyal and faithful in difficult circumstances.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>love is loyal</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>love remains faithful to the people we love</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>love always wants to think that what they are doing is good</p></blockquote><h4>13:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"13:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>hopes all things, endures all things.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Love hopes <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for good</span> in all circumstances.

It is important to avoid this wrong meaning and instead to imply that a loving person is strong. One way to do this is to translate the general statements in this verse as negatives, indicating the absence of limits. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>There is nothing love cannot face; there is no limit to its faith, its hope, its endurance. (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Love never gives up; its faith, hope and patience never fail. (GNT)</p></blockquote></div>",

When we try to understand God and his ways it is as if we are looking at them in a mirror. But in the future, we will understand them well, as if we are looking at them directly.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek this verse starts with a conjunction that the BSB does not translate. Some English versions translate it as “for.” The conjunction indicates that 13:12 is an explanation of the analogy Paul used in 13:11.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Now:</strong> The word <em>Now</em> refers to the present time, and contrasts with “then” in verse 12b.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we see but a dim reflection as in a mirror:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>we see but a dim reflection as in a mirror</em> is more literally “we look through a mirror in a riddle.” This metaphor means that at the present time we do not clearly understand the things of God. “Seeing” is a metaphor for “knowing” or “understanding.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we<sup>(incl)</sup> see <span data-bnType=\"implied\">things</span> as if they were reflected in a mirror</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We don’t understand God’s ways completely.</span> It is like we are looking in a mirror and we only see a reflection</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>mirror:</strong> In ancient times mirrors were made of a polished metal such as bronze.</p><h4>13:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"13:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>then we shall see face to face.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>In the future we<sup>(incl)</sup> shall see them as though we were face to face.</p></li><li><p>But in the age to come we will understand <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the things of God</span> clearly, like meeting somebody face to face.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>then:</strong> The word <em>then</em> refers to the future, in the end times.

In verses 7–8 he wrote about some ways to convey meaning through inanimate objects.

There are two ways to interpret this conjunction:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It introduces a <u>contrasting thought</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but (GNT) <em>(BSB, GNT, NIV, NJB, NCV, NRSV, ESV, NET, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It introduces a <u>continuation of thought</u>.

The translation and commentary support for interpretation (1) is slightly stronger.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>my spirit…my mind:</strong> Paul contrasted the worship in tongues that came from his inward spiritual being, with the thoughtful praise that he expressed in ordinary language. See the notes on 14:14 on <em>my spirit</em> and <em>my mind</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I will pray…I will sing:</strong> Paul said what <u>should</u> happen. In your translation, use verb forms that express a desire or determination to behave in a certain way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I intend to pray…I intend to sing</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I shall continue to pray…I shall continue to sing</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul did not refer to himself only but to any believer. In some languages it may be clearer to use a different pronoun. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they/we<sup>(incl)</sup> should pray…they/we<sup>(incl)</sup> should sing</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate verse 14:15b-c</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray also with my mind; I will sing with my spirit, but I will sing also with my mind.

Paul used the plural form in verse 23. In some languages it may be natural to use the plural form in verses 24–25 also. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But suppose all of you are prophesying when those unbelievers and outsiders come in. They will realize that they are sinners, and they will want to change their ways because of what you are saying. They will tell what is hidden in their hearts.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>24</sup>But suppose everyone is prophesying and some people come in who do not believe or do not understand. If everyone is prophesying, their sin will be shown to them, and they will be judged by all that they hear. <sup>25</sup>The secret things in their hearts will be made known. So they will bow down and worship God saying, “Truly, God is with you.” (NCV)</p></blockquote></div>",

In some languages it may be natural to use the second person to give all these instructions. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My friends, when you meet to worship, <u>you</u> must do everything for the good of everyone there…. No more than two or three <u>of you</u> should speak unknown languages during the meeting. <u>You</u> must take turns, and someone should always be there to explain what <u>you</u> mean.

First (15:1–11) he wrote about the evidence showing that God raised Christ from the dead. Then (15:12–34) he taught that God will raise believers from the dead.

Translate it in a way that is natural in your language to introduce an explanation.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>what I received I passed on to you:</strong> This clause introduces a summary of four historical events that are central to the Christian faith. Paul said that he heard this story from others, and he then told it to the Corinthians. The wording is very similar to 11:23a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>received:</strong> Paul <em>received</em> the gospel message from other believers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I handed on to you the message that I received</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the message that they/other people told me, I also told to you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as of first importance:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>as of first importance</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “<u>most important</u>.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the most important points (GW) <em>(BSB, GW, NIV, NASB, RSV, ESV, NET, NLT, NCV, NABRE, GNT, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “<u>first in time</u>.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in the first place (NJB) <em>(NJB, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).

In Greek, each of the four points is introduced by a word often translated as <em>that</em>. The points are connected to each other by a conjunction usually translated as <em>and</em>. The NJB is an example of an English version that stays close to the Greek:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>3b</sup><u>that</u> Christ died for our sins, in accordance with the scriptures, <sup>4</sup><u>and that</u> he was buried; <u>and that</u> on the third day, he was raised to life, in accordance with the scriptures; <sup>5</sup><u>and that</u> he appeared to Cephas… (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The BSB uses the word <em>and</em> to connect only the last item in the list.

In verses 5 through 7, adverbial conjunctions are used to make the connections between the witnesses. The Greek word ‘de’ is used at the beginning of verse 8 to signal that the following information is different. It introduces a witness that is important to the development of Paul’s argument. English does not have a way to signal this. If your language has a way to signal this, use it here.</span></span> Of all the people he mentioned, Paul was the last to see Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He appeared to me also:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>to me also</em> is emphatic. Consider how you might show that emphasis in your translation.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as to one of untimely birth:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>as to one of untimely birth</em> is more literally “like a miscarriage.” Paul used this figure of speech to emphasize that he did not become an apostle the same way the other twelve apostles did. He persecuted Jesus’ followers. Because of this he felt unworthy to be an apostle. There are two ways to translate this figure of speech:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as though I was a child born abnormally (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was like an aborted fetus whose birth is not counted as a child</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was like a stillborn child who is not expected to live</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was not worthy to see him</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>of untimely birth:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the meaning of the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>untimely birth</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>miscarriage</u> or <u>abortion</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am like an aborted child who was given life (GW) <em>(GW, NIV, GNT, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>born at the wrong time</u>.

This is supported by many English versions and commentaries,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See, for example, Fee p. 733; and Thiselton p. 1210.</span></span> and it fits with what Paul said in 15:9.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you follow interpretation (2), avoid the word “premature,” because Paul became a believer at a late time, not an early time.

This explanation is a quotation from the Old Testament scriptures. It may be helpful to make this clear by saying:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For the scripture says (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As the scripture says</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God has put everything under His feet:</strong> This is a quotation from Psalm 8:6. In the original form it is in the second person: “you have put everything under his feet.” Because of the change, some English versions do not mark the word <em>God</em> as part of the quotation. The BSB and many other versions do include it as part of the quotation. Either is acceptable. When Paul wrote in Greek he did not use quotation marks.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a prophecy. It is in the past tense, but it has not completely happened yet. At the end of this age God will defeat everything and will make everything subject to Jesus Christ. Use the tense that is appropriate in your language for a prophecy.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>God:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>God</em> is more literally “he.” This pronoun refers to God, as in Psalm 8:6. The BSB makes this explicit. Refer to God in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>under His feet:</strong> The phrase <em>under His feet</em> is a figure of speech that means “Christ rules over everything.” There are two ways to translate this figure of speech:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Keep the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God has put all things in subjection under his feet (ESV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning.

This is an Old Testament quotation. If the meaning is clear, it is best to translate the pronoun <em>His</em> literally.

It is not a time word.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>when it says:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>when it says</em> means “when the Scripture says.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Scripture that says</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when we<sup>(incl)</sup> read in the Scriptures</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that everything has been put under Him:</strong> Paul referred back to the quotation in 15:27a. Because Paul did not use quotation marks, the English versions vary as to whether they use quotation marks and where they place them.

The GNT, however, made this clear by abbreviating the quotation and only translated the part Paul referred to.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If your language uses quotation marks, you could use them to make it clear that Paul discussed the meaning of the word <em>everything</em>.</p><h4>15:27c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"15:27c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>this clearly does not include the One</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>this does not mean that God has been put under Christ.</p></li><li><p>obviously does not include God himself.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>this clearly does not include the One:</strong> Paul said that the word “everything” does not mean that <em>the One</em>, God the Father, will be put under Jesus Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>this does not mean that God himself has been put under Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the word “everything” obviously does not include God</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 15:27b-c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to combine 27b and 27c as in the GNT:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>27c</sup>It is clear, of course, <sup>27b</sup>that the words “all things” <sup>27c</sup>do not include God himself (GNT)</p></blockquote></div><h4>15:27d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"15:27d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who put everything under Him.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>This is because God is the one who put everything under Christ.</p></li><li><p>God is the one who places everything under the authority of Christ.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who put everything under Him:</strong> This is a relative clause.

He fought because he knew that Christ has risen from the dead. The wrong reasons (<em>human motives</em>) would be if he had fought to benefit himself.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is a way to translate this is using two sentences:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I fought wild beasts in Ephesus. If this was for human motives…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I fought wild beasts in Ephesus:</strong> The commentaries almost all agree that Paul spoke figuratively. The enemy he fought with was people, not animals.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>All modern commentaries, and most ancient ones, say that Paul referred figuratively to “people,” not to literal wild animals. See, for example, Fee p. 770–771; Thiselton p. 1251–1252; Morris p. 216; Verbrugge &amp; Harris p. 399–400; Garland p. 225; Grosheide p. 375; Kistemaker p.561; Orr &amp; Walther p. 336. Perhaps the most recent commentary that argues for a literal interpretation is Godet (1886).</span></span> According to Roman law, Roman citizens could not be punished by making them fight wild beasts.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>wild beasts:</strong> Paul used a figure of speech to refer to violent people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>brutes</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>vicious people who have hearts like tigers/wolves/bears</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>violent people who attacked me like wild beasts</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If possible, translate this with a figure of speech that readers will understand to refer to violent people.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Ephesus:</strong> <em>Ephesus</em> was a city in what is now western Turkey. Acts 19:1–20 records how Paul visited and preached in that city.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for human motives:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>for human motives</em> is literally “according to man.” There are at least two ways to interpret this phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It describes <u>the reason Paul fought</u> and means “thinking like a man” or “for human reasons.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>simply from human motives (GNT) <em>(BSB, GNT, NIV, NCV, REB, NET, NJB, NRSV, NASB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It indicates that <u>the expression “fought wild beasts” is figurative language</u>.

See how you translated this figure of speech in 15:26. Paul spoke of death as an enemy whom God defeats in battle. The power of death to harm people comes to an end. In 15:54d, he spoke of death in the third person, and then in 15:55 he addressed death directly in the second person. In some languages you cannot address “death” in this way. In some languages there is no abstract noun for “death.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here is an example of how to translate this in a language that does not have a noun “death”:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>54d</sup>God is victorious and he has caused it to be that people will never die again. <sup>55a</sup>Where are the dead people? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">There are none!</span> <sup>55b</sup>Where are those who mourn for dead people? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">There are none!</span></p></blockquote><h4>15:54d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"15:54d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Death has been swallowed up in victory.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“<span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has defeated death. There is no longer any death.”</p></li><li><p>“<span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has conquered his enemies and his people will no longer die.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Death has been swallowed up in victory:</strong> This saying is based on Isaiah 25:8. This is a metaphor. It indicates that God defeated the enemy, which is death. From that time and forever, people will never again have to die. There are two ways to translate this metaphor:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Keep the metaphor in some form. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Death is destroyed</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Death has been defeated</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has conquered death</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning of the metaphor.

It appears that the Corinthians had asked for Apollos to visit them.</p></div><h4>16:12a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"16:12a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Now about our brother Apollos:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ As for our<sup>(incl)</sup> brother Apollos,</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">In your letter you asked that</span> Apollos, our<sup>(incl)</sup> brother <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">might visit you</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Now about our brother Apollos:</strong> The phrase <em>Now about</em> refers to a topic that the Corinthians had mentioned in their letter. This phrase has been used several times. See 7:1, 7:25, 8:1, 12:1 and 16:1. See how you translated this phrase in those places.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">In your letter you asked</span> about our brother Apollos</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">In your letter you said you wanted</span> our brother Apollos <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to visit you</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>our brother Apollos:</strong> <em>Apollos</em> was a Jewish Christian leader. The Corinthians probably asked about him in their letter to Paul. This is Paul’s answer. Apollos is also mentioned in 1:12, 3:5, and Acts 18:24. Apollos was not literally Paul’s brother. He was a spiritual brother, a fellow believer in Jesus Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Probably Apollos was younger than Paul, although we do not know for sure. In languages that track the age of siblings it can be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>my younger brother, Apollos</p></blockquote><h4>16:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"16:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I encouraged him strongly to go to you<sup>(plur)</sup> along with the other brothers.</p></li><li><p>I told him to go visit you when the other brothers <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span> go.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers:</strong> Paul encouraged Apollos to visit the Corinthians.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I urged him to visit you with the other believers (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I begged him to go visit you when the other brothers went</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the brothers:</strong> These <em>brothers</em> were Christian workers. They may be the same Christian brothers mentioned in 16:11, or they may be the three men mentioned in 16:17a.</p><h4>16:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"16:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He was not at all inclined to go now,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He does not want to go at this time,</p></li><li><p>He said that he definitely would not go now.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek, this clause connects to the previous clause with a conjunction that the BSB does not translate. This conjunction introduces Apollos’ rejection of Paul’s attempt to encourage him to visit Corinth. Many English versions translate this conjunction as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He was not at all inclined to go now:</strong> This clause indicates that Apollos did not want to go to Corinth at that time. The word translated as <em>at all</em> means that he was very unwilling.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He did not at all want to come now (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he was quite determined not to go at present (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he said that he definitely would not go now</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>go:</strong> The BSB uses the word <em>go</em> to refer to Apollos’ travel to Corinth. The NCV and some other English versions use the word “come.” Consider whether <em>go</em> or “come” is more natural in your language.</p><h4>16:12d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"16:12d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but he will go when he has the opportunity.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but he will visit you<sup>(plur)</sup> when he has a chance.</p></li><li><p>However, he will go when the time is right.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>but</em> introduces a concession that contrasts with the refusal in 16:12c. In English it is not natural to use the word <em>but</em> in two consecutive phrases. English versions that use <em>but</em> in 16:12c sometimes begin a new sentence here without a conjunction. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will come when he has the opportunity. (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You could also use a different conjunction, as the GNT has:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When he gets the chance, however, he will go. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Connect these clauses in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he will go when he has the opportunity:</strong> Apollos hoped to visit the Corinthians at some future time that would be better or more convenient for him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he will visit you when he has an opportunity (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When he gets the chance,…he will go (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he will go when there is nothing to hinder him</p></blockquote>",

He also expressed appreciation for Stephanas and two other men who had come to visit him.</p></div><h4>16:15a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"16:15a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>You know that Stephanas and his household were the first converts in Achaia,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ You<sup>(plur)</sup> know that Stephanas and those who live in his house were the first people in Achaia to believe.</p></li><li><p>¶ You know Stephanas and his family.

This conjunction functions to introduce a new topic. Some English versions translate it as “now.” You should introduce this new topic in a way that is natural for your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You know that:</strong> The phrase <em>You know that</em> introduces a new topic by reminding the Corinthians of something that they already knew. Stephanas and his family lived in Corinth and the believers there knew them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Stephanas and his household:</strong> This family is also mentioned in 1:16. See the notes there. The word <em>household</em> refers to those who lived with Stephanas in his house. It may include slaves and servants as well as family members.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Stephanas and his family (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>were the first converts:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>the first converts</em> is literally “firstfruits.” It is the same word that occurs in 15:20b. Here it refers to the first entire family to believe in the Lord Jesus. Other individuals had been converted earlier. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the first people to believe in Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the first family to believe in Christ</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in Achaia:</strong> Corinth was in the Roman province of <em>Achaia</em>. The area is now southern Greece. See also Acts 18:12.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">there</span> in Achaia Province</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul was the person who baptized Stephanas and his family.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">when I first preached the gospel there</span> in Achaia Province, Stephanas and his family were the first people to believe</p></blockquote><h4>16:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"16:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They diligently work to serve the believers.</p></li><li><p>They keep on working hard as they help <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to teach</span> God’s people.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and they have devoted themselves:</strong> The phrase <em>they have devoted themselves</em> indicates that Stephanas and his family decided to help other believers. They chose to do this and they were doing it faithfully.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they…have given themselves (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they are working diligently</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to the service of the saints:</strong> The phrase <em>the service of the saints</em> refers to serving God’s people. Stephanas and his family did all they could to help other Christians.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they serve God’s people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they help God’s people</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">We do not know for sure how Stephanas and his family served people. If it is necessary to expand on the word “serve” you can translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they serve <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by helping</span> God’s people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they help <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to teach</span> God’s people</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>saints:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>saints</em> is the same word as was used in 16:1a. You should use the same word here as you used in 16:1a.</p><h4>16:15c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"16:15c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Now I urge you, brothers,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>My brothers and sisters, I encourage you<sup>(plur)</sup></p></li><li><p>I ask you, friends,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Now I urge you, brothers:</strong> The phrase <em>Now I urge you, brothers</em> functions to strengthen and emphasize the command that follows.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>brothers:</strong> Paul spoke to all the believers in Corinth, both men and women.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are is another other way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Now I urge you, brothers and sisters</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 16:15–16</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek text, verse 15 begins with the words “I urge you.” Paul started his appeal, and then he interrupted the appeal to give some information about the household of Stephanas. Then in verse 16 he returned to his appeal. The BSB changed the order in verse 15 so that the information about Stephanas is given first and then the parts of the appeal come together.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some English versions place the words “I urge you” at the beginning of verse 16. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>15</sup>Now, brethren, you know the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints; <sup>16</sup>I urge you to… (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Translate this so that Paul’s appeal to them to submit to Stephanas is clear.</p></div>",
