Compare the two versions.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Section Theme: These verses form an introduction to the whole letter. In them John states the authority which he has for giving instructions to his readers. He also explains what his purpose is in writing the letter. His authority is the fact that he had personally been with Jesus Christ, the eternal Word of God. His purpose in writing the letter is that the people he is writing to may truly share the fellowship he has with God.</p></div><h4>1:1–3 <em>(Sentence Breaks)</em></h4><p data-indent=\"1\">These verses are all one long and complicated sentence in the Greek and in some English versions such as RSV. The subject and main verb of this sentence come in verse 3, “We proclaim,” but its topic is at the end of verse 1, “the Word of life.” So in translation these verses may need to be split into shorter sentences and the parts may need to be reordered to make the meaning clear. See 1:1–3 in the Display.</p><h4>1:1</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our own eyes, which we have gazed upon and touched with our own hands—this is the Word of life.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ I am writing to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you<sup>(plur)</sup></span> about him who is God’s message to people and gives people real life. Long ago he already existed even before the beginning of the world. But now we<sup>(excl)</sup> ourselves have heard him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">talking</span>, and we have seen him, and we have watched him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">doing things</span>, and our hands have touched him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(GNT:) We write to you:</strong> <em>(Discourse Feature)</em> The fact that this is a letter is obvious from the way John writes. In the Greek, however, there is no formal beginning to the letter, naming the writer and the people he is writing to, as there is in Paul’s letters. In your translation it may be necessary to add some simple introduction such as “We write to you,” so that readers are not confused about whether they are reading a letter or a history or some other sort of literature.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>(GNT:) We:</strong> <em>(Pronoun System) </em>This letter was written by only one person, John, but throughout chapter 1 he uses the plural, <em>We</em>, because he is associating himself in what he is saying with the other apostles who also lived with Jesus. If this meaning will not be conveyed by <em>We</em> in your translation, it would be better to say “I write…,” and then “the other apostles and I have heard…,” etc. As an alternative the book introduction could contain an explanation of who John means by <em>We</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>That which was:</strong> <em>(Pronoun Reference) </em>This refers to the “Word of life” (see the note below). Since the “Word of life” is really Jesus, it may be better to refer to it as “he/him” in your translation.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>from the beginning:</strong> <em>(Meaning)</em> This refers to the beginning of the world. John is saying that the Word existed even before the creation of the world. He does <u>not</u> mean that the Word came into existence when the world was created.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with our own eyes:</strong> <em>(Focus)</em> All the four statements, “we heard…,” “we saw…,” “we looked at…,” “we touched…,” are emphasizing the fact that although the Word had existed from before creation, John and the other apostles had actually been with Jesus, who was the Word, when he was in this world. None of the four statements is more prominent than the others, so if phrases such as <em>with our eyes</em> are unnatural in translation they can be left implicit. But make sure that the emphasis on John’s personal experience is being clearly communicated.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>gazed upon:</strong> <em>(Meaning) </em>What is meant here is deliberate, continual, detailed observing, rather than the simple “seeing” of the previous clause.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>our own hands:</strong> <em>(Focus)</em> See note on “with our eyes” above.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Word of life:</strong> <em>(Meaning) </em>This means the word which is life, the word which is the source of life, as in John 14:6. It refers to Jesus, but it would be wrong to make his name explicit as John is not here emphasizing Jesus as a person. He is emphasizing the fact that Jesus is the one who causes us to be truly alive by showing us what God is really like.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Word:</strong> <em>(Special Biblical Term) </em>This is a Biblical technical term as in John 1:1. It refers to God’s words or message to people in which he shows them what he is really like. In translation it may be necessary to make it clear that this is the “Word of God.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>(JB:) who is life:</strong> <em>(Pronoun Reference) </em>If you need to make “God” explicit in the phrase “the Word of life” (or, “the Word, who is life”), make sure that this phrase <em>who is life </em>refers to the Word and not to God. See Display.</p>",

It refers to both the length of that life and to its quality. It means life which is never-ending and which is heavenly rather than earthly. In this verse it refers to Jesus, just as “the life” does at the beginning of the verse. It is emphasizing that the life which Jesus brings us has always existed in heaven.</p><h4>1:2e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that was with the Father</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and that from long ago he was together with God the Father,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with the Father:</strong> <em>(Meaning) </em>This is very similar to John 1:1 “the Word was with God.” It means that God and the Word (the Life) never existed separately, they were always together.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Father:</strong> <em>(Expression) </em>If it is necessary to specify whose father this is, say “our Father” here.</p><h4>1:2f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and was revealed to us.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but now God has shown him to us.<sup>(excl)</sup></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>was revealed to us:</strong> <em>(Alternative Interpretations) </em>See the note on 1:2a “revealed.” The same two interpretations are found here.</p>",

John repeats what he is telling his readers in order to emphasize his purpose in telling it to them, namely that he and they may be united in fellowship. In order to make this emphasis clear in translation it may be necessary to say</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The reason why we are telling you (plur) about this person who we have seen and heard is that we want you to be united with us in trusting him.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>what we have seen:</strong> <em>(Pronoun Reference)</em> John is still referring to Jesus as the “Word of life” (see the note on 1:1).

These steps in the argument may need to be made clear in translation. See the Display.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>also:</strong> <em>(Emphasis)</em> The word translated <em>also</em> occurs twice in the Greek, “we proclaim to you <u>also</u>” and “so that you <u>also</u> may have fellowship with us.” John is emphasizing that both the gospel and fellowship are not only for the apostles but for his readers also.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>may have fellowship with us:</strong> <em>(Meaning) </em>John means that his readers should <u>continue</u> to <em>have fellowship</em> with him. He is not implying that they need to become Christians so that they will have fellowship. Throughout this letter he repeatedly states that he is confident that they already believe in Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>fellowship:</strong> <em>(Special Biblical Term)</em> See <u>fellowship</u> in <em>Key Biblical Terms</em>. This term means being united, sharing in something on the basis of mutual agreement, especially in God’s blessings.

If he would not, then it would be right to translate it with some other more appropriate term.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I am writing:</strong> <em>(Pronoun System)</em> Notice that John now changes from writing in the plural “we” to the singular “I.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>these things:</strong> <em>(Pronoun Reference)</em> The words <em>these things</em> refer to what he has just said, especially in 1:5–7, about the way Christians should behave.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you will not sin:</strong> <em>(Meaning)</em> This follows closely what John has said in 1:9–10, that when Christians do wrong they must confess it.

It does not mean “friends” in the sense of companions or partners.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not writing to you a new commandment:</strong> <em>(Focus)</em> John’s theme here is that Christians should love one another. This follows from the importance of behaving as Christ behaved (2:6). In 2:7–8 he is showing that God has commanded us to love one another. He says this command is not new to his readers because Jesus gave it many years before (John 13:34). Yet Jesus called it a “new command.” John goes on to say that it is “new” in the sense that Jesus’ life and death showed for the first time what true love is, and it is also “new” in how it affects Christians’ lives.</p><h4>2:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but an old one, which you have had from the beginning.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">No,</span> it is that same command which you have known from the time when you began to follow Christ.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>an old one:</strong> <em>(Meaning)</em> John means that the command to love was one of the main points of the Christian instruction his readers had received in the past.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>from the beginning:</strong> <em>(Meaning)</em> This refers to the time when they first became Christians.

This is a summary of the section 1:5–2:27.</p></div><h4>2:27a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:27a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And as for you, the anointing you received from Him remains in you,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But as for you, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you will not be deceived because</span> Christ has given you the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is still in you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And as for you:</strong> <em>(Emphasis)</em> John is emphasizing here that the Christians, who knew the truth because they had the Holy Spirit in them, are different from the false teachers, who had wrong ideas.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the anointing you received from Him:</strong> <em>(Alternative Interpretations)</em> This probably refers to Christ giving the Holy Spirit.

In some languages the clauses in 2:27a–b may need to be reversed. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As for you, you do not need anyone to teach you, because/since the anointing you received from him remains in you.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you do not need anyone to teach you:</strong> <em>(Figure of Speech)</em> This is hyperbole, a deliberate exaggeration. What John says is stronger than what he means. He certainly thought that his readers needed <u>some</u> teaching because this whole letter is full of teaching. His meaning is that they do not need any teaching <u>other</u> than that which is from the Holy Spirit. If you cannot use hyperbole in this way in your language, you could say “you do not need any <u>other</u> teacher” in order to make the meaning clear. See the Display.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to teach you:</strong> <em>(Background Information)</em> The teaching would be about God’s truth.</p><h4>2:27c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:27c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But just as His true and genuine anointing teaches you about all things,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Instead of that, the Holy Spirit, who Christ has given to you, is causing you to know all the truth about those things.

(BSB, GNT, KJV, LB, JBP)</p></li><li><p>It may mean that the readers have really received the Holy Spirit. (NIV, NEB)</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>true and genuine:</strong> <em>(Emphasis)</em> In Greek this phrase is literally “is true and is not a lie.” John is here using repetition, first positive and then negative, for emphasis. If this sort of repetition is not natural in your language, you will need to use some other way of expressing the emphasis. The BSB expresses the emphasis by expressing a positive idea two times.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>about all things:</strong> <em>(Figure of Speech)</em> Again John is using hyperbole. He is emphasizing that the Holy Spirit teaches them about all those true things God has revealed which they need to know. See Display on 2:27b–c.</p><h4>2:27d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:27d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so remain in Him as you have been taught.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Therefore I say to you, remain united with Christ just as the Holy Spirit has told you to do.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in Him:</strong> <em>(Collocation)</em> See the note on 2:5c.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Him:</strong> <em>(Pronoun Reference) </em>This refers to Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>have been taught:</strong> <em>(Meaning)</em> The Holy Spirit is the one who has taught the Christians.</p>",

He will not command them to pray for those people because they have deliberately rejected all God’s help. But he <u>allows</u> them to pray for such people if they want to (because we do not know if possibly God may save them).
