First they wrote the name of the person or people who were writing the letter. Then they wrote the name of the person or people who would be receiving the letter. Then they wrote a Christian greeting. Paul did all three things in his letter to Philemon. He included:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The name of the person who wrote the letter: Paul (verse 1)</p></li><li><p>The name of the person receiving the letter: Philemon (verse 1)</p></li><li><p>A Christian greeting (verse 3)</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">Your translation may be easier to read if each of these three parts is a separate paragraph, as in the GNT, BSB, NIV, and RSV versions.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Carefully consider the best way to arrange the information in verses 1–3 when you translate verses 1–3. What is the usual way to begin a letter in your language? Can you follow that style and still include the three parts from Paul’s opening Section? All of the information in this opening Section should also be in the opening Section of your translation. For example, do not take Paul’s name out of the opening paragraph even though writers in your language put their name at the end of the letter. After you have decided what is the best way to begin a letter in your language, follow that same basic way consistently in your translations of all of Paul’s letters.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Read verses 1–3 carefully in the BSB and the GNT. Then read the following notes and the Display before you begin to translate.</p></div><h4>1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">This letter is from me,</span> Paul. I am in prison <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because I preach</span> about Jesus Christ.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Paul: </strong>The apostle Paul wrote this letter. He began by writing his name. There is no verb in verse 1 in the Greek text. But many languages require complete sentences, so you may need to add a verb. Paul was writing a letter to Philemon, so you could use a form of the verb “write” or the verb “greet.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is not natural in some languages for someone to talk about himself in the third person. For example, it would not be correct in some languages for Paul to write, “Paul is writing to you.” In such cases, you could translate this in a first person form:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I, Paul, am writing this letter.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a prisoner of Christ Jesus: </strong>Paul was saying, “I am in prison because I do the work of Christ Jesus.” GNT: “A prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus.” Paul was in prison when he wrote this letter. But that was not because he did something wrong. People put him in prison because he preached the Good News about Jesus Christ. Those who didn’t believe in Jesus Christ didn’t like Paul’s message, and so they put him in prison.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ Jesus:</strong> Paul and other authors who wrote New Testament books usually wrote “Jesus Christ” as Paul did in verse 3, instead of the name <em>Christ Jesus</em>, which Paul wrote here. The meaning is the same either way. If people who read your translation will think that <em>Christ Jesus </em>is a different person from “Jesus Christ,” you should use the more common order “Jesus Christ” here also.</p><h4>1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and Timothy our brother, To Philemon</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I and our<sup>(incl)</sup> fellow believer Timothy <span data-bnType=\"implied\">greet</span> you, Philemon.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Greetings</span> to you, Philemon, from our <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christian</span> brother Timothy and from me.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Timothy:</strong> Timothy also sent Philemon his greetings. Timothy was Paul’s close friend who worked for Jesus just as Paul did. Bible scholars think that Timothy probably did not help Paul write this letter. But he was with Paul at the time Paul wrote the letter, and he also wanted to greet Philemon.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>brother:</strong> The word <em>brother</em> in this context refers to a fellow believer in Christ. Paul, Timothy and Philemon were probably not physically related to each other as members of the same earthly family are. Timothy was a younger Christian, a fellow believer of Paul and also of Philemon and the other Christians at Colosse.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>brother</em> as used among Christians means that they are spiritual brothers and sisters because they are God’s children. They are closely related to one another in this sense. Perhaps you can use the term “brother” for men who are Christians and “sister” for women who are Christians (as in verse 2). Or perhaps there is a word that you could use to include both men and women (such as “sibling” in English). If your language has different words for “older brother” and “younger brother,” use “younger brother” here in verse 1 because Timothy was younger than both Paul and Philemon. If “brother” means only a member of the same family in your language and no one will understand a spiritual relationship here, a footnote could explain how Christians used the term then. Or perhaps there may be another term you can use to show how one family member is related to another family member.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>To Philemon: </strong>This means “We greet you, Philemon.” This was a way people wrote letters in Paul’s time. Philemon, who received the letter, understood the implied meaning “we send greetings.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Philemon:</strong> Philemon was the main person Paul was writing this letter to. Philemon, who lived in the town of Colosse, was an important man and was probably rich. He was also the master of the slave Onesimus. Paul had helped Philemon to become a Christian (see verse 19b).</p><h4>1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>our beloved fellow worker,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You are a dear friend and you work <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for Christ</span> like we<sup>(dual excl)</sup> do.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>our beloved:</strong> Both Paul and Timothy loved Philemon very much. You could translate the phrase <em>our beloved</em> as “We love you very much.” See Display for verse 1c.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>fellow worker:</strong> The phrase <em>fellow worker</em> means that Philemon helped to spread the Good News, like Paul and Timothy did. He probably did not work together with Paul in the same place.</p>",

Beginning at verse 4, Paul wrote directly to Philemon. Even if your translation addresses Philemon in the second person (“to you, Philemon”), perhaps you should refer to these people in the third person. For example, “We send greetings to Apphia…,” or “Give our greetings to Apphia….”</p><h4>2a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to Apphia our sister,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We<sup>(dual excl)</sup> also greet</span> Apphia, who is our<sup>(incl)</sup> fellow believer.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Greetings</span> to Apphia, who is like a sister to us.<sup>(incl)</sup></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>sister:</strong> Paul also greeted Apphia. The phrase “Apphia our sister” means that Apphia was a believer in Christ as Paul was. She did not have the same father or mother as Paul and Philemon. See the note on “brother” in verse 1b.</p><h4>2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to Archippus our fellow soldier,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We<sup>(dual excl)</sup> also greet</span> Archippus, who strongly preaches <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the Good News</span> with us.<sup>(incl)</sup></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>fellow soldier:</strong> Paul also greeted Archippus. The phrase <em>Archippus our fellow soldier</em> implies that Archippus spoke out bravely for Christ when people were against the Good News, like a soldier fights to protect his country. (Colossians 4:17, 1 John 2:14) But there is nothing to indicate that Archippus was a soldier in any earthly army.</p><h4>2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and to the church that meets at your house:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We<sup>(dual excl)</sup> also greet</span> the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other</span> Christians who worship God at your house.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>church:</strong> Paul also greeted the believers that met in Philemon’s house.

It is as if Paul was saying a prayer, asking God to bless those he was writing to.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Grace and peace:</strong> This was a greeting and blessing Paul often used in his letters. (For example, 1 Corinthians 1:3, Galatians 1:3, Ephesians 1:2).</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Grace:</strong> The word <em>Grace</em> in this context means “kindness, favor, good will, or blessing.” Paul was asking God to be kind to those to whom he was writing. He wanted God to favor them. Try to think of ways in your language for asking God to bless someone. The term <em>Grace</em> is an important term in the New Testament. See “grace&quot;, sense A2(b) in <em>Key Biblical Terms</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>peace:</strong> Paul meant “peace of heart” here. This results from a person having peace with God. The term <em>peace</em> also implies “peace with one another.” People who have peace of heart normally live in peace with one another.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to you:</strong> The word <em>you</em> is plural here and thus includes all the people whom Paul addressed in the first two verses.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>God our Father:</strong> For Christians, God is like a father, one who loves us and cares for us.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Lord:</strong> The word <em>Lord</em> here in verse 3 means “master” or “leader.” Jesus Christ is our spiritual leader.

Paul thanked God because Philemon had faith in the Lord Jesus, and because he loved God’s people. This love gave Paul great joy.

So Paul was thanking God, apparently because people had told him that Philemon continued to trust in the Lord Jesus and that he loved all God’s people. The word “because” (BSB) shows that the reason Paul thanked God for Philemon (verse 4) was that Philemon trusted in Christ and loved Christ’s people (verse 5).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In the RSV it is not clear how the words <em>love</em>, <em>faith</em>, <em>Jesus</em>, and <em>saints</em> go together.

And Philemon trusted the Lord Jesus to save him from the punishment for sinning and to give him power not to sin.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>your love for all the saints:</strong> Using an active verb expresses this more clearly: “You love all the saints.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>love:</strong> The Greek word <em>agapē</em> here refers to one person loving another or others. Philemon truly loved God’s people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>saints:</strong> The Greek word <em>hagious</em> (literally “holy ones”) in this verse refers to Christians, those who belong to God.

That is, with whom is Philemon sharing in believing? Is it with other Christians (later including Onesimus) or is it with Paul (and Timothy)?</p><p data-indent=\"2\">What is the connection between “may become active” and “in/by knowledge”? Does the phrase “in the knowledge of every good thing” describe the means by which that fellowship or sharing becomes effectual, or is the knowledge of every good thing the result of that fellowship/sharing?</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are three alternative interpretations that seem the most likely, out of several possibilities that commentators have suggested:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>That <em>sharing</em> (Greek: <em>koinōnia</em>) refers to sharing, or bonding, with others who believe the same truths. English Bible versions often translate <em>koinōnia</em> as “fellowship” when it has this sense. In this interpretation the meaning is that Paul was praying that Philemon would have active fellowship with other believers as he came to understand every good thing that God had done for (or in) God’s people. In this interpretation the words “in the knowledge of every good thing” refer to the means by which this fellowship or bonding would happen. <em>This fits well with the theme of the letter. Paul was about to appeal to Philemon to be merciful toward his runaway slave, Onesimus, because now they both believed in Christ. Although Paul had not yet mentioned his request to Philemon to forgive Onesimus, he was looking forward to </em><u><em>the fellowship that Philemon would have with Onesimus</em></u><em>. This would happen because they both now recognized God’s goodness to them.</em></p></li><li><p>That <em>Sharing</em> means that Philemon <u>shared his faith with others</u>, that is, he told other people about the gospel message he believed. (NIV and CEV follow this interpretation.) So the phrase “in the knowledge of every good thing” could refer to the result of sharing his faith. There is more than one way to interpret what this result might be. NIV interprets this to mean that Paul prayed that, as Philemon told others about what he believed, Philemon would gain “a full understanding of every good thing we have in Christ.” CEV interprets this to mean that Paul prays that as Philemon tells others about what he believes, those people “will come to know all the blessing Christ has given believers.”</p></li><li><p>That <em>Sharing</em> means “fellowship” as in the first interpretation, but here in verse 6 it is <u>the fellowship Paul and Timothy had with Philemon</u> that is in focus. The words “in the knowledge of every good thing” refer to the results of Philemon’s fellowship with Paul and Timothy. Thus GNT interprets the meaning of Paul’s prayer to be that, as Philemon had fellowship with Paul and Timothy, Philemon would understand more deeply all the blessings they had as they lived in union with Christ.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">There are also other possible interpretations of this verse. However, the first interpretation seems to fit best with the purpose of the letter. Paul was preparing Philemon for something he was about to ask Philemon to do on behalf of their fellow believer, Onesimus. Paul was probably thinking about how Philemon could help Onesimus. He was preparing Philemon by asking him to think about the good things God had given all Christians and by urging him to act for Christ’s honor. Remembering these facts would cause Philemon to have closer fellowship with all Christians, including his slave, Onesimus, who had recently become a Christian.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There is yet another problem that you need to consider. Different versions translate the Greek phrase <em>eis Christon</em> at the end of the verse (among other ways) as “in Christ,” “for Christ,” or “to Christ.” There are two interpretations of how the word <em>eis </em>functions in this verse:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Greek word <em>eis</em> relates to the Greek verb that the literal English version above translates “become effective.” This would mean that the purpose for becoming effective is to honor Christ. If you agree with this interpretation, you might restate the phrase <em>in Christ</em> this way: “May this happen for the sake of Christ,” or “This will bring honor to Christ,” or “This will cause people to praise Christ.” JB, NASB and the Amplified Bible follow this interpretation (1).</p></li><li><p>The Greek word <em>eis</em> relates to the phrase “every good thing.” Thus the whole phrase would imply “all the good things that are ours because we are in union with Christ,” or “because we believe in Christ.” The BSB, NIV and GNT follow this interpretation (2).</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">There is also a textual problem in this verse. In place of <em>en hēmin</em> ‘in us,’ some ancient Greek manuscripts have <em>en humin</em> ‘in you.’ However the weight of the manuscript evidence seems to support <em>en hēmin</em>. Also the UBS Greek New Testament 4th edition rates this reading as a B (very probable) degree of certainty. Of the major English versions, only the KJV and the NASB follow the reading <em>en humin</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Display (first Meaning Line) for verse 6 shows a translation of verse 6 that follows interpretation (1) above:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I pray that the fellowship which you have with those who believe as you do may increase/deepen, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">through your</span> knowing all the good things <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that God has</span> given us (incl). <span data-bnType=\"implied\">May this happen</span> for <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the glory of</span> Christ.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The notes on “fellowship&quot;, sense A2 in <em>Key Biblical Terms</em> support this interpretation</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Or, if you choose interpretation (2) above for verse 6, you could translate the whole verse as follows:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I pray that you may be active in sharing your faith, so that you will come to understand fully all the good things God has given us<sup>(incl)</sup>, and that this will result in people glorifying Christ.</p></blockquote>",

Paul stated clearly in verse 17 what he was asking Philemon to do. He said, “Welcome Onesimus back just as you would welcome me.” But before Paul asked Philemon to do this, he told Philemon several reasons why he should welcome Onesimus back. In verses 8–11, he told Philemon that he wanted him to do something to help Onesimus because Onesimus had become a Christian and would be useful to Philemon. Paul told Philemon that another reason why he should help Onesimus was because Philemon loved Paul and his other Christian brothers. In verses 12–14, Paul said that he was sending Onesimus back to Philemon, even though he wanted to keep Onesimus with him. In verses 15–16, Paul told Philemon why God may have allowed these things to happen, and that he (Paul) loved Onesimus very much. Then in verses 17–21, Paul finally said clearly that he wanted Philemon to welcome Onesimus. Paul offered to pay for anything Onesimus owed to Philemon. He also reminded Philemon that in the past he had helped Philemon become a Christian. This was another reason why Paul expected that Philemon would do what he asked.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In this Section (verses 8–21) Paul, as a Christian brother, asked Philemon to help Onesimus, but did not command him to do it.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Read verses 8–21 carefully in the BSB and the GNT.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1058001008\" data-endVerseId=\"1058001011\"><h3>Paragraph 8–11 Paul appeals to Philemon on behalf of Onesimus</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Read verses 8–11 again, then read the following notes before you translate.</p></div><h4>8</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So although in Christ I am bold enough to order you to do what is proper,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ I ask you to do something that you should do.

This means that the words in verse 7 are the reason for what Paul said in 8–9a. He was thinking like this: Therefore (since Philemon loves his Christian brothers,) he should also love Onesimus. But Paul did not yet make all of this meaning explicit.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in Christ: </strong>There are two ways of understanding the meaning of the phrase <em>in Christ</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As an apostle of Christ, Paul had authority from Christ to command Philemon to do this.</p></li><li><p>As a Christian brother, Paul had a close relationship with Philemon that freed him to tell Philemon to do this. GNT follows this interpretation by translating this “as your brother in Christ.”</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The following phrase in the BSB is: <em>I am bold enough to order you</em> . So the first interpretation fits better with this idea of giving an order in contrast to asking him to do something.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>bold:</strong> The word <em>bold</em> means “not afraid.” Paul was not afraid to say whatever he should say.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>order:</strong> To <em>order</em> someone means to command him. It means to tell someone to do something. As an apostle of Christ, Paul could have <u>told</u> Philemon to help Onesimus. But Paul decided it was better to <u>ask</u> him, as a friend and a fellow Christian.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to do what is proper:</strong> This refers to what Paul thought Philemon should do in order to act as a Christian should act. What Paul implied here was that he wanted Philemon to welcome Onesimus. But Paul did not say this openly until verse 17.</p>",

He said, “Welcome Onesimus back just as you would welcome me.” But before Paul asked Philemon to do this, he told Philemon several reasons why he should welcome Onesimus back. In verses 8–11, he told Philemon that he wanted him to do something to help Onesimus because Onesimus had become a Christian and would be useful to Philemon. Paul told Philemon that another reason why he should help Onesimus was because Philemon loved Paul and his other Christian brothers. In verses 12–14, Paul said that he was sending Onesimus back to Philemon, even though he wanted to keep Onesimus with him. In verses 15–16, Paul told Philemon why God may have allowed these things to happen, and that he (Paul) loved Onesimus very much. Then in verses 17–21, Paul finally said clearly that he wanted Philemon to welcome Onesimus. Paul offered to pay for anything Onesimus owed to Philemon. He also reminded Philemon that in the past he had helped Philemon become a Christian. This was another reason why Paul expected that Philemon would do what he asked.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In this Section (verses 8–21) Paul, as a Christian brother, asked Philemon to help Onesimus, but did not command him to do it.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Read verses 8–21 carefully in the BSB and the GNT.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1058001015\" data-endVerseId=\"1058001016\"><h3>Paragraph 15–16 Onesimus is now a brother in Christ</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In these verses Paul said that it could be a good thing that Onesimus ran away from Philemon. As a result, Onesimus became a Christian. As he went back to Philemon, he went back not only as a slave, but also as a Christian brother. If he had not run away, he might not have become a Christian.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Read verses 15–16 again.</p></div><h4>16a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"16a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a beloved brother.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And from now on he will not be <span data-bnType=\"implied\">merely</span> your slave.

He was still Philemon’s slave. It means that Philemon should not think of him only as a slave, but also especially as his Christian brother. GNT: “he is not just a slave.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>slave:</strong> Onesimus belonged to Philemon because he was Philemon’s <em>slave.</em> For more information on “slave&quot;, see Introduction to Philemon.</p><h4>16b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"16b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He is especially beloved to me, but even more so to you,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I love him very much, but you should love him even more.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>even more so to you:</strong> Paul was saying that Philemon had a reason to love Onesimus even more than Paul did. This was because Onesimus would now be a faithful slave and a Christian brother to Philemon.</p><h4>16c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"16c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>both in person and in the Lord.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You will love him</span> as your slave and because he is a Christian brother.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in person:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates <em>person</em> here probably means that Onesimus was still a slave. But Philemon would be able to love him now as a person who would obey him and not run away.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the Lord:</strong> This refers to Onesimus as a “fellow Christian,” someone who was united to the Lord Jesus just as Philemon was.</p>",

He wanted Philemon to welcome Onesimus back in the same way that Philemon would welcome Paul if Paul were visiting him. This is the main point of the whole letter.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul promised to repay Philemon for anything Onesimus may have taken from Philemon or for anything wrong he may have done against him.

He could also have said, “Thinking of what I have just written to you.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if:</strong> Another way of expressing what Paul means by the word the BSB translates as <em>if</em> is “since” or “because.” Paul often used the word <em>if</em> with this meaning. If you translated 17a as “I am not sure you consider me a partner,” this would be the wrong meaning. Paul knew that Philemon thought of him as his partner. So he was saying, “Since you think of me as your partner.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>partner:</strong> The Greek word <em>koinōnos</em> in this verse means “a friend who is a fellow Christian” (see verse 17 in LB, JBP). It refers to someone who works together with someone else to serve the Lord.

It seems that normally Paul dictated his letters to someone else who wrote them on paper. But a few times he wrote a small part of the letter himself, as he did here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I, Paul, write this with my own hand. I will repay it:</strong> Paul emphasized that he was promising to pay what Onesimus owed to Philemon by writing the promise himself in his own handwriting. Another way of expressing this is like the GNT: “I, Paul, will pay you back.”</p><h4>19b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"19b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>not to mention that you owe me your very self.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But don’t forget that you also are in debt to me for your <span data-bnType=\"implied\">new spiritual</span> life <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because I helped you to become a Christian</span>.</p></li><li><p>You know already that, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">if I had not helped you, you would not have found new life yourself, so</span> you owe me your own life.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul may have been smiling in the last part of verse 19. He probably knew that Philemon would not force Onesimus to repay him. He probably would not force Paul to pay anything, because Philemon owed something to Paul too.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In the middle of this last sentence in verse 19, Paul stopped referring to what he owed Philemon and started referring to what Philemon owed him. So the BSB uses a dash (—) to set the last part of this sentence apart from the text in the earlier part of the verse.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not to mention:</strong> This is a way of saying something that Paul didn’t really want to say because he knew it might cause Philemon to feel a little ashamed. It was Paul’s way of reminding Philemon of something Philemon already knew. There are other ways to translate the phrase “not to mention.” For example: “I should not have to remind you, of course,” (RSV), “I won’t mention that” (NLT).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you owe me your very self:</strong> Paul had helped Philemon to become a Christian, and so Philemon owed his new spiritual life, his whole Christian life, to Paul. This meant that Philemon owed Paul much more than Onesimus owed Philemon. Another way to translate the Greek word <em>seauton</em>, “your own self,” is “your very soul.” Here are two alternate ways to translate this whole phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your debt to me is big because through me you received eternal life.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You owe a lot to me because I helped you believe in Christ.</p></blockquote>",

So the meaning is clearer in the CEV: “do this for me” (referring to the favor Paul asked for in verse 17).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the Lord:</strong> The main idea of this phrase seems to be that Paul wanted Philemon to think about Paul’s request as a fellow believer in Christ would.

Paul stated clearly in verse 17 what he was asking Philemon to do. He said, “Welcome Onesimus back just as you would welcome me.” But before Paul asked Philemon to do this, he told Philemon several reasons why he should welcome Onesimus back. In verses 8–11, he told Philemon that he wanted him to do something to help Onesimus because Onesimus had become a Christian and would be useful to Philemon. Paul told Philemon that another reason why he should help Onesimus was because Philemon loved Paul and his other Christian brothers. In verses 12–14, Paul said that he was sending Onesimus back to Philemon, even though he wanted to keep Onesimus with him. In verses 15–16, Paul told Philemon why God may have allowed these things to happen, and that he (Paul) loved Onesimus very much. Then in verses 17–21, Paul finally said clearly that he wanted Philemon to welcome Onesimus. Paul offered to pay for anything Onesimus owed to Philemon. He also reminded Philemon that in the past he had helped Philemon become a Christian. This was another reason why Paul expected that Philemon would do what he asked.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In this Section (verses 8–21) Paul, as a Christian brother, asked Philemon to help Onesimus, but did not command him to do it.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Read verses 8–21 carefully in the BSB and the GNT.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1058001017\" data-endVerseId=\"1058001021\"><h3>Paragraph 17–21 Paul asks Philemon to welcome Onesimus back</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph Paul finally stated clearly to Philemon what he wanted him to do. He wanted Philemon to welcome Onesimus back in the same way that Philemon would welcome Paul if Paul were visiting him. This is the main point of the whole letter.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul promised to repay Philemon for anything Onesimus may have taken from Philemon or for anything wrong he may have done against him. But Paul knew that Philemon probably would not ask him to repay him, because Paul had helped him to become a Christian. Christ surely changed the way Philemon thought about life and about money. In fact, Paul was sure that Philemon would do what he was asking him to do and even more.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul was also sending Onesimus back to Philemon because Onesimus needed to obey his master again and help him and show that he had changed. If Onesimus did this, he and Philemon could have peace with each other again.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Read verses 17–21 again.</p></div><h4>21</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse is a summary of what Paul was asking Philemon to do for Onesimus. Paul believed quite strongly that Philemon would do what he was asking him to do. And Paul may also have been thinking as he wrote this verse that perhaps Philemon would cancel all of Onesimus’ debt. See notes on verses 19 and 20.</p><h4>21a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"21a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Confident of your obedience, I write to you,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Even as</span> I write to you, I am sure you will do <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what I asked</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>confident:</strong> Paul meant, “I am sure,” or, “I know.” He was reassuring Philemon that he believed that Philemon would be willing to do what Paul was asking him to do.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>your obedience:</strong> The Greek words translated <em>your obedience</em> literally mean “that you will agree to my request.” Paul had said in verses 8 and 9 that he was asking Philemon to do only what Philemon chose willingly to do. He was not ordering him. The way the CEV translates it is probably closer to the actual meaning: “knowing that you will do what I ask you.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I write:</strong> Paul himself wrote the part in verse 19 but probably did not write the whole letter with his own hand. He usually had someone write for him while Paul told him what to write. Paul was saying here that he was the one who had chosen what words to put in the letter.</p><h4>21b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"21b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>knowing that you will do even more than I ask.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yes,</span> I know that you will do even more than I asked.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>even more than I ask:</strong> Paul believed that Philemon would do all that was right as a Christian. This meant not only doing what Paul asked, which was to accept Onesimus back, but doing more as well. Paul may have been thinking about two things when he said <em>even more</em>: (a) Perhaps Philemon would not force Onesimus or Paul to repay any of Onesimus’ debts. And (b) perhaps Philemon would free Onesimus from slavery. But Bible scholars do not know whether Paul was thinking this, and they don’t know if Philemon did either of these things.</p>",
