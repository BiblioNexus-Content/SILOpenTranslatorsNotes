The three parts are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Paul introduced himself. He did this by writing his name, his position, and source of authority. He also mentioned Timothy, who helped him to serve the believers in Corinth.</p></li><li><p>Paul explained who he was writing to.</p></li><li><p>He greeted them.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Introduction (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Greetings from Paul (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Opening remarks of the letter</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Or you may not want to have any section heading here (as in the NIV and GNT).</p></div><h4>1:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I,</span> Paul, an apostle who represents Christ Jesus</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">This letter is from me,</span> Paul. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am</span> a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">chosen</span> messenger of Jesus Christ,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Paul:</strong> This name explains who wrote the letter. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>From</u> Paul (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to use a full clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>This letter is from</u> Paul (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I,</span> Paul, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">write this letter.</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>apostle:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>apostle</em> means “ambassador” or “messenger.” It refers to a person whom someone sends with his authority to accomplish a mission or a particular purpose. Here, an <em>apostle</em> is a person whom Jesus sends to represent him and teach his message with authority. The word or phrase for <em>apostle</em> in your language should indicate a position of trust and authority.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you have already translated the Gospels, you can probably use the same term for <em>apostle</em> as you used there. In some languages you may need to change it slightly for this context. You may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>representative/ambassador</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">special</span> messenger</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>sent-person</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Borrow a well-known word or phrase from another language. For example, if a common language is Spanish:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>apostol <em>You may then want to explain the meaning of the word in a footnote. For example:</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>An apostol is someone whom Christ chose to represent him and who has his authority.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">See the term apostle in the Glossary. If the term you choose for <em>apostle</em> means “messenger,” make sure that it does <u>not</u> refer to a person who only delivers a message and then has no further responsibility for the message.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Christ Jesus:</strong> Paul often used the phrase <em>Christ Jesus</em> as an alternative to “Jesus Christ.” Putting the word <em>Christ</em> first probably emphasizes that word, but the meaning is the same as “Jesus Christ.” The word <em>Christ</em> is a title. In some languages it is more natural to have the word <em>Christ</em> after the name <em>Jesus</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jesus Christ (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ:</strong> The word <em>Christ</em> is a title for Jesus. It literally means “the anointed one.” The Jews used this title to refer to the person whom God had appointed and promised to send as King and Savior. The Hebrew word is <em>mashiach</em> (English spells this word as “Messiah”). Some ways to translate <em>Christ</em> are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Borrow the word from a common language and spell it as a person would say it in your language. You also may want to explain the meaning of <em>Christ</em>. You should indicate that it is a title. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the chosen one</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Christ, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the one whom God promised to send</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the one who was sent</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning of the title. You should indicate that it is a title. In English, the way to show it is a title is to capitalize the words in the phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The One Who Was Sent</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The One Whom God Chose</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">The word or phrase may already be commonly used in the churches in your area. Since this is the first time the word <em>Christ</em> is used as a title in this book, you may want a footnote to explain the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The word “Christ” means “The Chosen One.”</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The word “Christ” means “The One Who Was Chosen and Anointed.” God chose Jesus to be the promised Savior.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also Christ in the Glossary.</p><h4>1:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>by the will of God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because God chose me</p></li><li><p>because that is what God wanted. (NCV)</p></li><li><p>indeed, God chose me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for this work</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by the will of God:</strong> This phrase indicates that God <u>chose</u> Paul to be an apostle. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>chosen by God</u> to be an apostle (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because that is what God wanted (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whom God chose to become one/so</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>God:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>God</em> here refers to the eternal spirit who created everything. He is more powerful than any other spirit, and he is perfectly good and wise. He deserves to be worshiped.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate <em>God</em>:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a name or title for <em>God</em> that people in your culture already use.</p></li><li><p>Use a descriptive term that fits the truth about <em>God</em> that is revealed in the Bible. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Creator</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Great Spirit</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Ruler of the universe</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Choose a term that is acceptable to the believers and churches in your area.

Probably Paul wrote the letter and Timothy supported his writing in some way. (They may have discussed the problems at Corinth while Paul wrote.) This phrase probably does not imply that Timothy wrote parts of the letter and Paul wrote other parts. Indicate or imply that Paul was responsible for writing the letter, but Timothy was with him as he wrote. You may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Explain it in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Also Timothy our brother <span data-bnType=\"implied\">is with me</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and our brother Timothy <span data-bnType=\"implied\">greets you</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">too</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Explain it in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul included Timothy here because the believers in Corinth knew Timothy (Acts 18:5). Probably Paul wrote the letter and Timothy supported his writing in some way.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Timothy:</strong> <em>Timothy</em> traveled with Paul (Acts 16–20), which included going to Corinth. Paul wrote two letters to him (1 Timothy and 2 Timothy).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>our brother:</strong> Here the word <em>brother</em> refers to a believer in Jesus. The word indicates a close relationship, because all believers become children of God. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer only to an actual brother by birth. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain in your translation. Some examples are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>our brother <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>fellow believer</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who is also a follower (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>1:1d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>To the church of God in Corinth,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>To the church of God in Corinth,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I write to</span> God’s people in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the city/town of</span> Corinth,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I write to you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> believers <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who meet together</span> in Corinth.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>To the church of God in Corinth:</strong> This phrase refers to the people to whom Paul wrote. In some languages it is more natural to use a full clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am writing to God’s church in Corinth (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This letter is</span> to the church of God in Corinth</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>church of God:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>church</em> refers to a gathering of people that someone summoned for a particular purpose. The phrase <em>of God</em> indicates that the gathering was a group of believers. The word <em>church</em> does <u>not</u> refer to a building. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>congregation of God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>group of believers</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>gathering of those who follow God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The word or phrase you use should <u>not</u> refer to the separate groupings in the church of Jesus that exist today that each have their own name.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Corinth:</strong> This name refers to a city in southern Greece. It was an important city at that time. In some languages people are not familiar with the name <em>Corinth</em>. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Explain it in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the city of</span> Corinth</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Explain it in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Corinth is a city in southern Greece.

This phrase indicates that Paul wanted <em>the saints throughout Achaia</em> to read the letter as well. Corinth was a city in a province then named <em>Achaia</em>. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>together with all God’s people throughout the whole of Achaia (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I invite</span> all the saints throughout Achaia <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to read this letter</span> as well.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>saints:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>saints</em> is literally “holy ones.” The word refers to all believers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s people (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>throughout Achaia:</strong> This phrase refers to the other villages and towns in the province of <em>Achaia</em>. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in the whole of Achaia (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>within the province of Achaiya<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Western Bukidnon Manobo Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Achaia:</strong> The name <em>Achaia</em> referred to a province that included Corinth and the southern part of Greece. In some languages people are not familiar with the name <em>Achaia</em>. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Explain it in your translation.

But Paul changed the form of the Greek word from “greetings” to “grace” and added <em>peace</em> to make the greeting have a Christian message. Many New Testament letters begin this way.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause has no verbs. Paul asked God and Jesus to <u>give</u> the grace and peace. In some languages it is more natural to include a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">May</span> grace and peace <span data-bnType=\"implied\">be given</span> to you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I ask that</span> you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">may receive</span> grace and peace</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I ask</span> God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to bless</span> you with grace and peace</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Grace:</strong> The word <em>Grace</em> here refers to God being kind to people, who do not deserve it. God does things for people because he wants to and not because they earned it. Here Paul asked God to show grace or be kind to his readers. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>kindness</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>help</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>favor</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>voluntarily/graciously be kind</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>help <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as a gift/favor</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>peace:</strong> The word <em>peace</em> means “without anxiety” or “absence of conflict.” The word <em>peace</em> also refers to people being physically, mentally, and spiritually well, even when they have troubles and difficult circumstances.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it will be better to translate <em>peace</em> using a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>live peacefully</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>be at peace</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God our Father:</strong> This phrase indicates that God has a relationship with believers such as a father has with his children. All believers are God’s adopted children. This phrase does not indicate that God fathered children. In some languages translating literally would indicate the wrong meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Explain the proper meaning in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God our <span data-bnType=\"implied\">adoptive</span> father</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God our Father <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in heaven</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who is like a</span> father to us</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate literally and explain the meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The word “father” here indicates that God has a relationship with believers such as a father has with his children. All believers are his adopted children.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Lord Jesus Christ:</strong> In some languages a possessive pronoun must be used with the word <em>Lord</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jesus Christ who is <u>our</u> Lord</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Lord:</strong> This word means “the one in authority over others” or “master.” Jesus has authority over all things.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Master</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Chief</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Owner</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Sovereign</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it will be necessary to add a word like “my” before such a word.

But God comforted and encouraged them during that time. Here Paul praised God for that (1:3). Paul also taught that those who receive comfort can comfort others (1:4–7). He explained his hardships in the province of Asia, how he felt during them, and his trust in God to deliver him from them (1:8–10). He acknowledged the prayers of the believers in Corinth and indicated that God’s answer to those prayers would result in thanks to God (1:11).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s Thanksgiving after Affliction (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God comforted Paul and the Corinthians</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:3a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:3a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Blessed be the God and Father of our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord Jesus Christ,</p></li><li><p>¶ God, who is God and Father to our Lord Jesus Christ, is worthy to be praised!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Blessed be</em> can also be translated as “Blessed is.” Paul declared that God was <u>worthy to be praised</u>.

Paul probably used <em>Father</em> here to imply that God is like a father to all who need compassion, meaning all people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Father who is compassionate (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the all-merciful Father (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>our merciful father<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Western Bukidnon Manobo Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>compassion:</strong> This word refers to concern for someone with troubles and includes a desire to help that person. A person with <em>compassion</em> understands how someone feels when he is suffering. It is one of the ways a father feels toward his children when they are in trouble and need help.

(2) Some later Greek manuscripts have the words <u>comfort and salvation</u> (KJV only).

If that is true in your language, you may want to translate these clauses without the <em>If</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When we are distressed, you will be comforted and saved. And when we are comforted, you will also be comforted</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Even when we are weighed down with troubles, it is for your comfort and salvation!

In some languages it is more natural to translate with a verb here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>saving/freeing by God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of his people</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for God to save his people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>being saved from death</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here Paul probably implied that when he preached the gospel, people persecuted him. But he accepted that distress from the persecution because people in Corinth believed and God saved them. So <em>salvation</em> is not a direct result of the distress, but both distress and <em>salvation</em> are results of preaching. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that distress or oppression causes God to save other people. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Explain in your translation.

He explained his hardships in the province of Asia, how he felt during them, and his trust in God to deliver him from them (1:8–10).

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is more natural to omit the conjunction and allow the context to indicate the connection. The BSB has not translated this conjunction.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>We do not want you to be unaware, brothers:</strong> Here the term of address, <em>brothers</em>, comes after Paul begins saying something to the Corinthians. In some languages it is more natural to have the term of address first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Brothers, we do not want you to be uninformed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>We do not want you to be unaware:</strong> This clause indicates that Paul wanted the believers to know about his hardships. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we do not want you to be ignorant (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we want you to know (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>brothers:</strong> Here the word <em>brothers</em> refers to fellow believers. The Greek word refers to both men and women here.

Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>difficulties</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>adversity</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the suffering we experienced (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>province:</strong> The BSB adds the word <em>province</em> to indicate that the name “Asia” refers to the Roman province called “Asia.” The word <em>province</em> refers to a large region. The Romans conquered a number of small countries and grouped them into the <em>province</em> of Asia.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Asia:</strong> The province of <em>Asia</em> included most of the land in what is now western Turkey. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer to the modern-day region of the world that includes China and India. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>At that time, the name “Asia” referred to a province that included most of the land in what is now southwestern Turkey.</p></blockquote><h4>1:8c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:8c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>We were under a burden far beyond our ability to endure,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>We were burdened <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with troubles/difficulties</span> to the extreme, beyond our strength to cope/endure,</p></li><li><p>Excessive burdens/difficulties/hardships came upon us, which were more than we could bear/stand-against.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>We were under a burden far beyond our ability to endure:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>far</em> refers to an excess of something. Here it indicates an excessive amount of pressure. The difficulties were worse than anything Paul and the others could stand against by their own power or abilities. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we were burdened <u>excessively</u>, beyond our strength (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The burden of it was far too heavy for us to bear (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we were completely overwhelmed, the burden was more than we could bear (JBP)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>We were under a burden:</strong> The Greek clause is literally “we were burdened excessively” (as in the NASB). The difficulties they had were figuratively like carrying a great weight. Paul and the other evangelists often faced much persecution and opposition (as in Acts 19:23–41). Translate in a way that includes such things as persecution and opposition. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The burdens laid upon us were so great (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We were crushed and overwhelmed (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Our sufferings were so horrible (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>1:8d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:8d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that we despaired even of life.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that we did not think we could continue to live.</p></li><li><p>It was so bad, we thought we could not live beyond them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we despaired even of life:</strong> The Greek phrase is literally “to despair us even to live.” These difficulties were so great that Paul and the others thought that the difficulties might cause their death.

However, the contrast to 1:8 is not clear, so many English versions translate this Greek word as emphasis here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In fact (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we felt we were under the sentence of death:</strong> Paul and the other evangelists felt that they would not live to old age, but that people would persecute and kill them. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we had the sentence of death within ourselves (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we were carrying the sentence of death within our own selves (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we felt sure that we would be killed</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we were certain that someone would kill us</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the sentence of death:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>sentence</em> usually refers to an official answer or decision made by someone in authority. In this context, Paul and his companions probably did not receive an official answer from someone that they must die, but they felt as if they had. See the examples above.</p><h4>1:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in order that we would not trust in ourselves,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>in order that we should not trust in ourselves</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">But that occurred</span> so that we will not rely on our own power</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in order that:</strong> The Greek phrase is literally “so that” (as in the NJB). The Greek conjunction introduces the purpose for what Paul said in 1:9a. Another way to translate this Greek word is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But this made us (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we would not trust in ourselves:</strong> Here the word <em>would</em> indicates that Paul and the others <u>should</u> not rely on themselves. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we should rely, not on ourselves (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>not trust in ourselves:</strong> The word <em>trust</em> refers to <u>trusting</u> in something. Paul and the others would not trust in their own strength or abilities to escape death. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>trust not in ourselves (NJB)</p></blockquote><h4>1:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but in God, who raises the dead.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but in God, the one who raises the dead.</p></li><li><p>but rather <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we should rely</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">only</span> on God.

In some languages it is more natural to repeat some of those words. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">we would trust</span> in God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who raises the dead:</strong> This clause is a general statement about God raising the dead when he wants to and that he will one day raise everyone for judgment.

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other gods and only this one <em>raises the dead</em>.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for he raises the dead</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He raises the dead.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>raises the dead:</strong> This phrase refers to causing someone to live again after he has died.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you can help us with your prayers (NCV) <em>(NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), since the Greek verb indicates continuing action.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Thrall translates this as “whilst you also co-operate by prayer on our behalf” (p. 78).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as you help us by means of your prayers for us (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>while you co-operate by praying for us (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>help us:</strong> The Greek word is literally “working-together.” Paul and the believers in Corinth were both praying for Paul’s ministry. In that way they were <u>working together</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>join in helping us (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>prayers:</strong> The word <em>prayers</em> refers to the event of speaking to God, either to praise Him, thank Him, or ask Him something. This term does not refer to ritualistic words or words of magic. Use the proper word or phrase in your language.</p><h4>1:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Then many will give thanks on our behalf</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>So then, many believers will thank God for us</p></li><li><p>Therefore, many people will thank God on our behalf</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Then:</strong> The Greek word is literally “so that” (as in the RSV). The results of the believers in Corinth praying (and God answering) would be that many other believers would thank God for answering those prayers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>many:</strong> The Greek phrase is literally “many faces.” The word “faces” refers figuratively to people. Here this phrase refers to many believers in places other than Corinth. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>many people (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>many believers</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>on our behalf:</strong> This phrase indicates that the believers would thank God for what he had done for Paul and the other evangelists. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for us (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>1:11c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:11c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for the favor shown us in answer to their prayers.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>for the gift/favor <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of God’s help</span> to us when <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will answer the prayers of many believers.</p></li><li><p>when <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he</span> favors us <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with an answer/response</span> because many people prayed for us.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the favor shown us:</strong> The Greek phrase is literally “the gift/favor to us.” This phrase refers to the help that God gave to Paul and the others. The help was a gift, because Paul and the others had not earned it. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s favour shown to us (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the gracious gift given to us (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s gracious favour towards us (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the blessings we receive (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in answer to their prayers:</strong> This phrase explains why God favored Paul and the others. Many believers prayed for Paul and the others, and God answered those prayers. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>many prayers for us will be answered (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as the result of the prayers of so many (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because many people prayed for us (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The false teachers probably tried to discredit Paul in any way they could so that they could become the leaders of the church at Corinth. After Paul left Corinth, the false teachers accused him of various wrongdoings, but in this division, Paul explained his actions and explained that their accusations were wrong. One such accusation was that Paul was not keeping his promise to visit. He explained his change of plans in 1:12–2:4. He also repeatedly encouraged the believers in these verses to obey the correct teachings.</p>",

But he probably came earlier than planned and had a painful visit (2:1). After he returned to Ephesus, he wrote a painful letter (7:8–9). He then went to Macedonia via Troas (2:12–13) instead of via Corinth. The false teachers probably accused him of not being trustworthy because he had changed his plans. So Paul explained in these verses why he had changed his plans.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s Integrity (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Why Paul changed his plans (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul explained his change of plans</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:12a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And this is our boast:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Indeed, our<sup>(excl)</sup> boast is this:</p></li><li><p>¶ Now, one thing we are proud of is this,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates here as <em>And</em> is often translated as “for” or “because.” But in this context, the conjunction introduces a new theme and only generally connects back to the previous theme. The GNT and NJB allow the context to indicate a new theme and omit this conjunction. The conjunction may emphasize the new theme. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Indeed (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>There is one thing that… (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>this is our boast:</strong> This clause indicates that the boast follows in 1:12b–g. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>our boast is this (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>There is one thing that we are proud of, namely (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>boast:</strong> This word refers to praising someone or saying how good someone is. Paul used it in both a positive and a negative way. Here he used it in a positive way: to be happy about how he acted. God enabled him to live in a holy and sincere manner (1:12e).</p><h4>1:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Our conscience testifies that</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>our conscience accurately/faithfully reports that</p></li><li><p>and our inner being truthfully asserts that</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>conscience:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>conscience</em> refers to the record of past deeds that a person has in his mind. Paul knew he did nothing wrong, so his <em>conscience</em> was clear and not troubled. Therefore his <em>conscience</em> testified that he had done nothing wrong. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>inner being</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>ways of thinking</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>convictions of the mind</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>testifies:</strong> This word means “report what one saw.” The word is often used where the person is expected to be truthful and accurate. Here Paul knew that his conscience accurately claimed he had done nothing wrong. His conscience was not deceiving him. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>faithfully reports</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>accurately/truthfully asserts</p></blockquote><h4>1:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>we have conducted ourselves in the world,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>everything we have done toward people,</p></li><li><p>whatever we did toward other people in the world,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we have conducted ourselves:</strong> Here the word <em>conducted</em> refers to the way they lived and the things they did. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we have behaved (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>everything we have done (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the world:</strong> Here the word <em>world</em> refers figuratively to the people of the world. Paul referred to people in general here and then to believers in 1:12d. The word does not imply that the people are evil here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>towards everyone (NJB)</p></blockquote><h4>1:12d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and especially in relation to you,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and above all how we have behaved toward you<sup>(plur)</sup>,</p></li><li><p>and even more so whatever we did toward you,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>especially:</strong> Paul and the others put special emphasis on doing the right things with the believers in Corinth. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>all the more (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>above all (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in relation to you:</strong> The Greek phrase is literally “toward you” (as in the RSV). The phrase “we have conducted ourselves” (1:12c) is implied but not repeated here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when we were with you (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>1:12e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in the holiness and sincerity that are from God—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>was done in an honest and sincere way, which are <span data-bnType=\"implied\">attitudes</span> from God.</p></li><li><p>God enabled us to do them openly and with true/straight motives.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the holiness and sincerity that are from God:</strong> The Greek phrase is literally “simplicity and sincerity of God.” There are two ways to interpret how the phrase “of God” connects to “simplicity and sincerity”:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It <u>connects to both</u> <em>simplicity</em> <u>and</u> <em>sincerity</em>. God is the source of both attitudes. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God-given frankness and sincerity (GNT) <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, NABRE, NLT, GW, NET, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It <u>connects only to</u> <em>sincerity</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>simplicity and godly sincerity (ESV) <em>(RSV, NASB, ESV, REB, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Thrall (p. 128) and Harris (p. 183) translate according to interpretation (1). Barnett (p. 95) says, “Each is ‘of God,’ that is, true of God and issuing from God in the course of his service of God.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the holiness and sincerity:</strong> There is a textual issue regarding the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>holiness</em> here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some Greek manuscripts have the word that means <u>simplicity</u> or <u>frankness</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we have had an <u>honest</u> and sincere heart from God (NCV) <em>(GNT, NRSV, NABRE, CEV, NET, ESV, NCV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Other Greek manuscripts have the word that means <u>holiness</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>with <u>holiness</u> and godly sincerity (RSV) <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, NJB, NASB, NLT, GW, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1), since the UBS Greek New Testament recommends it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word refers to something being sincere or honest. Nothing is hidden. All that Paul and the others did was from good motives. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>openly</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>without hiding/withholding anything</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>sincerity:</strong> This word refers to having pure motives. Paul and the others did not do anything for selfish or wrong reasons. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>true/straight motives</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>for no evil reasons</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>that are from God:</strong> This phrase indicates that God caused Paul and the others to have the attitudes of openness and sincerity. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God-given (GNT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:12c–e</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">1:12c–e in Greek has the manner (1:12e) before the main clause (1:12c) and the emphasized clause (1:12d). This order may be more natural in some languages. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12e</sup>in the openness and sincerity that are from God <sup>12c</sup>we have conducted ourselves in the world, <sup>12d</sup>and especially in our relations with you.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is more natural to have the manner clause after the main clause but before the emphasized clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12c</sup>we have conducted ourselves in the world <sup>12e</sup>in the openness and sincerity that are from God. <sup>12d</sup>We have conducted ourselves this way especially in our relationship with you.</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:12f–g</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12f–g\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(reordered) We have done like that according to God’s grace and not according to worldly wisdom.</strong></p></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not in worldly wisdom, but in the grace of God:</strong> These phrases contrast <em>worldly wisdom</em> with <em>the grace of God</em>. The two are very different. In some languages it is more natural to have the positive saying first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>according to God’s grace but/and not according to worldly wisdom</p></blockquote><h4>1:12f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>not in worldly wisdom,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>We<sup>(excl)</sup> have not depended on human wisdom</p></li><li><p>We have not lived according to thoughts considered wise by people who do not follow God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not in worldly wisdom:</strong> 1:12a–g is one sentence in the Greek and the BSB. But some translations divide the sentence by adding a phrase here to make reading and understanding easier. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>And we were guided</u> by God’s wonderful kindness instead of by the wisdom of this world. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>We have done so, relying</u> not on worldly wisdom but on God’s grace. (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>worldly wisdom:</strong> The word <em>wisdom</em> means “the ability to understand events and know the right action.” But in this context, the phrase <em>worldly wisdom</em> refers to the thoughts that seem wise to people who do not follow God. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>thoughts considered wise by worldly people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>worldly people’s <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so-called</span> wise thoughts</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul disliked and avoided using <em>worldly wisdom</em>. Your translation should not imply that <em>worldly wisdom</em> was a good thing that Paul chose not to use.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>worldly:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>worldly</em> refers to wisdom that people discover without help from God. It implies that these people do not follow God. Other ways of translating this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>unspiritual</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>earthly (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>our own human (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>1:12g</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12g\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but in the grace of God.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we depended</span> on God’s <span data-bnType=\"implied\">undeserved</span> favor.</p></li><li><p>Instead, we lived according to God’s way of being kind <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to those who do not deserve it</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the grace of God:</strong> The word <em>grace</em> here refers to God being kind to those who do not deserve it. God does things for people because he wants to and not because they earned it. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>kindness from God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s help</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s favor</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>voluntarily/graciously be kind</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>help <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as a gift/favor</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated the word <em>grace</em> in 1:2.</p>",

But he probably came earlier than planned and had a painful visit (2:1). After he returned to Ephesus, he wrote a painful letter (7:8–9). He then went to Macedonia via Troas (2:12–13) instead of via Corinth. The false teachers probably accused him of not being trustworthy because he had changed his plans.

The word <em>Confident</em> refers to a strong belief about something. Paul had no doubt that the believers in Corinth accepted him, respected him, and had a good relationship with him (1:12–14). Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Confident of that</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was sure of that, and so</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Certain of those things</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>this:</strong> Here this word refers to the mutual respect Paul expected between himself and the believers in Corinth (1:14) and more generally to the good relationship between them (1:12).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Thrall (p. 136), Harris (p. 192), Barrett (p. 74), and Kistemaker (p. 57).</span></span> In some languages, “that” would indicate the correct connection.

The visit while going to Macedonia is the first benefit (1:16a) and the visit while returning from Macedonia is the second benefit (1:16b).

Paul planned a second long visit (1 Corinthians 16:6), which would be a second benefit. Like his first long visit (Acts 18:11), they would <u>again</u> receive the benefit of an extended amount of teaching.

It probably emphasizes <em>of God</em> as well. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is God whose Son this is, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">namely</span> Jesus Christ</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If possible, emphasize one or both parts. In some languages it is more natural to have the name <em>Jesus Christ</em> first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Jesus Christ, the Son of God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Son of God:</strong> This phrase is a title for Jesus. This title was often used to refer to a savior who would be a descendant of King David. God would send this savior to rescue his people. This person was often referred to as the “Messiah” or “Christ.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The title <em>the Son of God</em> also indicates that Jesus has the same nature and character as God. The relationship between God the Father and Jesus, his Son, is similar in some way to the relationship between human fathers and sons. God the Father does not have a physical body. He did not have a sexual relationship with Mary that resulted in her becoming pregnant and giving birth to Jesus. The Son of God existed eternally as the Son with his Father.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In areas where people do not understand the title <em>the Son of God</em> in this way, you may want to include a footnote that explains the correct meaning. Here is a suggested footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This title refers to Jesus. It indicates that Jesus has the same nature and character as God. It does not mean that God the Father had a sexual relationship with Mary that resulted in her becoming pregnant and giving birth to Jesus. Mary became pregnant with Jesus in a miraculous way by the Holy Spirit of God.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is natural to speak of a son as a “child,” without specifying male or female. If that is true in your language, you may use a more general term, such as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Child of God<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A translation of the title “the Son of God” must include a familial term such as “son” or “child.” Translations such as “the man who is God,” “the divine man,” or “the God man” are not acceptable, since they do not retain familial language. Examples of acceptable translation options include “the Son who comes from God,” and “the divine/unique/eternal Son of God.”</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Other verses will usually make clear that Jesus was a male child. If you use a phrase such as “the male child of God,” be sure that it does not imply that God had another child who was female.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ:</strong> The word <em>Christ</em> is a title for Jesus. The word <em>Christ</em> literally means “the anointed one.” Translate the word <em>Christ</em> here as you did in 1:1.</p><h4>1:19b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:19b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who was proclaimed among you by me and Silvanus and Timothy,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>whom I, Silas, and Timothy proclaimed to/among you<sup>(plur)</sup>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who was proclaimed among you by me and Silvanus and Timothy:</strong> This clause is passive. Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy preached, but the focus is on the pronoun <em>who</em>, which refers to Jesus. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whom I, Silas, and Timothy preached among you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause interrupts the main discussion in 1:19. See the General Comment at the end of the notes on 1:19 about possibly moving this clause in the verse.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>proclaimed:</strong> This word means “announce” or “proclaim.” Paul and the others announced that Jesus was the Christ to people in Corinth and some of them believed. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>preached (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>among you:</strong> The word <em>among</em> indicates that Paul and the others preached at various times to various gatherings of the people of Corinth. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to you (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>me and Silvanus and Timothy:</strong> Silvanus and Timothy came to Corinth and joined Paul during his first visit to Corinth (Acts 18:5). All three preached about Jesus while they were in Corinth.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Silvanus:</strong> The Greek spelling of this name here is “Silouanos.” The Latin (Roman) spelling is <em>Silvanus</em>, and some translations follow that spelling. The Aramaic spelling is “Silas.” In other places in the New Testament, this name is spelled <em>Silvanus</em>, so the BSB consistently spells this name <em>Silvanus</em>. You may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Follow the Greek or Latin spelling here. You may then want a footnote to explain the other spelling. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Elsewhere in the New Testament, this name is spelled “Silas.” “Silvanus” is the Latin version of this name.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Spell the name consistently, as the BSB does. You may then want a footnote to explain the spelling in the Greek. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Literally “Silvanus.” “Silvanus” is the Latin version of the name “Silas.”</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>1:19c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:19c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>was not “Yes” and “No,”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>was not “Yes” and “No” at the same time,</p></li><li><p>did not say “Yes” when he really meant “No.”</p></li><li><p>was surely not saying “yes” and thinking “no.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not “Yes” and “No”:</strong> This phrase indicates that Jesus is not hypocritical, deceitful, unstable, or fickle. See the note at 1:17 or how you translated this phrase in 1:18.</p><h4>1:19d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:19d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but in Him it has always been “Yes.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but/and in him our words are always “Yes.”</p></li><li><p>Through him our message is always “Yes.”</p></li><li><p>The gospel, which we proclaim, always fulfills what it says/promises because of him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but:</strong> The Greek language considers 1:19d to contrast to 1:19c. But some languages would not consider the connection to have contrast. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Western Bukidnon Manobo Back Translation on TW.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in Him it has always been “Yes.”:</strong> The Greek clause is literally “(it/he) has become (and still is) yes in him.” The subject of this clause is not explicit in the Greek. There are two ways to interpret what the subject should be:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The subject is <u>it</u>, and it refers to “our message” in 1:18b, meaning the gospel and the promises in it (1:20). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In Christ it has always been yes (NCV) <em>(BSB, NIV, RSV, ESV, NET, NCV, REB, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The subject is <u>he</u>, and it refers to Jesus (1:19a). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he is God’s “Yes” (GNT) <em>(NJB, GNT, CEV, NASB, NABRE, KJV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Bruce says, “all the promises of God find their Yes—a fulfillment which his people acknowledged in their worship with the confirmatory Amen, uttered through Christ” (p. 181). Some scholars support a third option: “Yes” is the subject. But then the sentence would be “in him yes has become.” To this author, that sentence feels incomplete.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek clause indicates that it became “yes” in the past and continues to be “yes.” Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Because of him our message was always true (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>by means of his deeds and words, our message is always “Yes”</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:19a–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The words in 1:19b explain something about Jesus (1:19a), but they interrupt what Paul said about Jesus in 1:19a and 1:19c–d. It may be more natural to have these words before or after 1:19a and 1:19c–d. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>19a</sup>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, <sup>19c</sup>was not “Yes” and “No,” <sup>19d</sup>but in him it has always been “Yes.” <sup>19b</sup>It was he who was preached among you by me and Silas and Timothy.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For <sup>19b</sup>I and Silas and Timothy preached <sup>19a</sup>the Son of God, Jesus Christ among you, and he <sup>19c</sup>was not “Yes” and “No,” <sup>19d</sup>but in him it has always been “Yes.”</p></blockquote></div>",

But here the conjunction probably introduces a new part of what Paul wants to say. The conjunction probably does not indicate contrast to 1:22.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I call God as my witness:</strong> The Greek clause is literally “I call God as witness regarding my soul.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The KJV says, “…upon my soul.” The BDAG says that the Greek word that often means “upon” means “feelings directed toward someone, <em>in, on, for, toward</em>” (sense 15, page 366). It can also mean “power, authority, control of or over someone or something, <em>over</em>” (sense 9.c, page 365), or “hostile opposition, <em>against</em>” (sense 12.b, page 366).</span></span> It indicates that God can say what Paul had done.

Here the phrase implies the person wanting too much control and the people resenting him. Paul did not want to be always telling them what to do or believe. Instead he wanted them to seek God and make God <em>lord</em> of their lives. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>dominate (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>have control over (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>become sole decision maker for</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>set ourselves as dictators over</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul was already leader over the believers and their teacher. The phrase here indicates that Paul did not want excessive control over them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>faith:</strong> Here the word <em>faith</em> means “a strong and sincere belief in something or someone.” To have <em>faith</em> in a person means to trust someone, to rely on someone, to be committed to someone.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it is by faith that you stand firm:</strong> The Greek clause is literally “by faith you stand firm.” The phrase <em>by faith</em> is possibly emphasized. The BSB and other English versions add the phrase <em>it is</em> to make the English grammar correct. The clause without emphasis is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you stand firm <u>by faith</u></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>by faith:</strong> This phrase indicates that the lives of the believers are established <u>by means of their faith</u>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you stand firm:</strong> The Greek clause is literally “you have stood.” This clause indicates that the believers remained strong in faith. The Greek indicates that the believers stood firm in the past and continued to stand firm in the present.

The idiom “a door was opened” indicates that Paul had an opportunity to preach Jesus where many people would listen (2:12). He expected to meet Titus there, but Titus was not there, so Paul went to Macedonia (2:13). Titus later came to Macedonia and met with Paul (7:5).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:14, Paul stopped talking about his travels. Instead, he thanked God for leading him. Paul compared God’s leading to a victory parade (2:14). He explained that believers represent Jesus (2:15–16b). He indicated that such ministry is difficult (2:16c). He also explained that he and the other evangelists do not preach as a way to earn money (2:17).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s Mission as Christ’s Spokesman (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The ways God leads</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:12a–13a</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Now when I went to Troas…and a door stood open for me in the Lord:</strong> In 2:12a–b Paul explained the situation at Troas. But Paul related in 2:13a the main event that he wanted to talk about. The BSB uses the word <em>when</em> at the beginning of 2:12a–b to show that 2:12a–b indicates when that event happened. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now <u>when</u> I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ and <u>when</u> a door was opened for me in the Lord, I had no rest (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">There is a contrast between the good thing that God did for Paul (2:12a–b) and Paul’s lack of “peace in my spirit.” In some languages it is more natural to translate the contrast. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I had gone to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ. The Lord had opened a door for me, <u>but</u> I still had no peace of mind</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, <u>even though</u> a door was opened for me in the Lord, my spirit was not at rest (ESV)</p></blockquote><h4>2:12a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:12a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ When I went to Troas for the sake of the good news about Christ</p></li><li><p>¶ And/Then, I went to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the city of</span> Troas in order to announce the good news concerning Christ,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Now:</strong> The Greek conjunction here indicates that Paul continues his letter.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When I arrived (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Troas:</strong> This name refers to an important city that followed Roman ways. It was in the Roman district of Mysia. That land is now the northwest part of the country of Turkey. In some languages people are not familiar with the name <em>Troas</em>. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Explain in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the city of</span> Troas</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate literally and explain the meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Troas was an important city that followed Roman ways. It was located in the Roman district of Mysia. That land is now the northwest part of the country of Turkey.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to preach the gospel of Christ:</strong> The Greek phrase can be translated “<u>for the purpose of</u> the gospel of Christ.” Paul went to Troas to spread the gospel of Christ. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for the sake of the gospel of Christ (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">But preaching the gospel was probably Paul’s main activity. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to proclaim the gospel of Christ (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>gospel of Christ:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates here as <em>gospel</em> means “good news.” In the New Testament the Greek word refers to the good news that Jesus is the Christ. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the good message about Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the good news concerning <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus</span> Christ</p></blockquote><h4>2:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and a door stood open for me in the Lord,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and saw that the Lord had opened a door for me to serve him there,</p></li><li><p>and a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">great</span> opportunity existed for me to do the Lord’s work.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a door stood open for me in the Lord:</strong> The Greek clause is literally “a door was opened for me <u>in the Lord</u>.” There are two ways to interpret the phrase <em>in the Lord</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The phrase indicates that Paul’s work <u>was as the Lord had commanded him</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>where an opening awaited me for serving the Lord (REB) <em>(RSV, NJB, NASB, REB, ESV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The phrase indicates that <u>the Lord made it possible</u> for Paul to do his work. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Lord had opened the way for the work there (GNT) <em>(NIV, GNT, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul probably indicated interpretation (1) and implied interpretation (2). It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Hodge (p. 42) says the phrase “in the Lord” relates to the whole clause. Barrett (p. 94) says “Paul’s success in evangelizing was due to the Lord.” Harris (p. 238) says it may mean “by the Lord,” “in the Lord’s providence,” or “in the Lord’s service.”</span></span> If possible, interpretation (2) should be implied. Other ways to translate interpretation (1) are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>an opening awaited me for serving the Lord (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a door was open for me to do the Lord’s work</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a door stood open:</strong> This idiom refers to an opportunity. Here Paul had the opportunity both to preach the gospel and to strengthen the believers there. The idiom also implies that the people of Troas wanted to hear the gospel and would not persecute Paul. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>opened the way (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Lord had already prepared the way (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>an obvious…opportunity (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Lord had made a way for me</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Lord:</strong> Here the word <em>Lord</em> may refer to either God or Jesus. If possible, translate in a way that allows both interpretations.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The context is not clear as to whom the word <em>Lord</em> refers. But other verses such as 3:16–18 imply that Paul was referring to God. Some languages must say who <em>the Lord</em> is. If that is true in your language, you should refer to God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Lord:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Lord</em> means “the one in authority over (something)” or “master.” It refers to someone greater in status or power than the person speaking. Jesus is ruler over all things. Another way to translate this word is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>ruler</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 1:2 or 1:14.</p>",

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that there are other gods and that only this one <em>leads us triumphantly as captives</em>. If that is true in your language, translate this clause in a way that tells more about God. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He always leads us in triumphal procession</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>leads us triumphantly as captives:</strong> The Romans had a custom where a victorious general had a victory parade in Rome. His soldiers were in the parade. Some of his prisoners were also in the parade. The prisoners became slaves or were executed. However, Paul does not say whether he saw himself as one of the soldiers or as one of the prisoners. There are several ways to interpret this clause:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Paul implies <u>both</u> of the metaphors of <u>soldiers and slaves</u>. He used both metaphors elsewhere in his letters and may intend them both here. Early in his life, Paul fought against the followers of Jesus, but God conquered him and he began to follow Jesus. <em>Paul saw himself as a slave to Jesus and suffered in serving him. He may have expected to be killed for serving Jesus. Being led as God’s prisoner demonstrated God’s greatness.</em> <em>On the other hand, Paul followed orders from God like a good soldier. He was victorious in spreading the gospel.</em> <em>So then, the translation should either:</em> <em>(a) refer to both the soldiers and the prisoners. An example is:</em></p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>leads us <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like a general</span> in a victory parade of soldiers and prisoners <em>(b) not refer to either the soldiers or the prisoners. An example is:</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>leads us in a victory parade <em>(NIV, NJB, NRSV, NABRE, NET, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Paul saw himself as <u>God’s prisoner</u>. He was God’s slave and suffered in serving him. He may have expected to be killed for serving Jesus. Being led as God’s prisoner demonstrated God’s greatness. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we are always led by God as prisoners in…victory procession (GNT) <em>(BSB, GNT, NLT, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Paul saw himself as <u>God’s victorious soldier</u>. Paul was victorious through Jesus in spreading the gospel. He began many new groups of believers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>leads us in triumph (RSV) <em>(RSV, NASB, GW, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Martin (p. 46) says, “Paul is the conquered slave exposed to public ridicule (1 Corinthians 4:9, 10, 13)…and, at the same time, ‘he is the joyful participant in Christ’s victory celebration.’”</span></span> You should not follow interpretation (3), because that interpretation of the Greek word is not well supported in Greek texts. Because the BSB follows interpretation (2), the NIV is in the Display.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">You may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Explain this Roman custom in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>leads us as a general leads a victory parade of soldiers and captives</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate literally and explain the Roman custom in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Romans had a custom in which a victorious general had a victory parade in Rome. His soldiers were in the parade as well as some of his prisoners.

He was victorious in spreading the gospel.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in Christ:</strong> This phrase probably means “through our union with Christ” or “in the cause of Christ.” Their relationship with Jesus enables believers to remain joyful as God leads them through all circumstances. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God who always gives us <u>in Christ a part</u> in his triumphal procession (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in union with Christ (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>through Christ (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>2:14c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:14c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of Him.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and who spreads the scent/aroma of knowing Christ everywhere through us.</p></li><li><p>God also causes more and more people to know Christ through our work/ministry.

If possible, emphasize the phrase <em>the fragrance of the knowledge of Him</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and through us:</strong> This phrase indicates that God enables his apostles to spread the gospel of Jesus. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God <u>uses us to make</u> the knowledge about Christ spread everywhere (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>spreads everywhere:</strong> God (2:14a) causes the fragrance to spread. The Greek here indicates a continuing action.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the fragrance of the knowledge of Him:</strong> This metaphor indicates that <em>the knowledge of Him</em> is like a <em>fragrance</em>. The metaphor may refer to:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>A <em>fragrance</em> is something that people smell but do not see. In the same way, believers tell others about Jesus, but true <em>knowledge of Him</em> occurs by faith and not by sight.</p></li><li><p>A <em>fragrance</em> can smell good to some people and bad to others. It depends on the things they relate the smell to. For example, some people like the smell of the sea and others do not.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">A metaphor allows people to connect the two parts in various interesting ways. Try to translate this metaphor as a metaphor. But if that is not possible, try using a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the knowledge about Christ…<u>like</u> a sweet fragrance (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages this metaphor is confusing. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the fragrance <u>that consists of</u> the knowledge of him (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God uses us to make clear what it means to know Christ. <u>It’s like a fragrance that fills the air</u>. (GW)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Only use the metaphor in 2:15–16 and not here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the knowledge of him</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>fragrance:</strong> During the victory parade people burned incense or fragrant spices. The Greek word can refer to both good and bad smells. In 2:15–16 the smell is both good and bad, depending on who smells it. If possible, the word you use should be general. It should not refer only to good smells or only to bad smells. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>scent (JBP)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\">Many English versions use the word <em>fragrance</em>, which refers to a good smell, because God is completely pleased with what Jesus did. But some people reject Jesus and so consider it a bad smell.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the knowledge of Him:</strong> The pronoun <em>Him</em> probably refers to Christ. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the knowledge about <u>Christ</u> (GNT)</p></blockquote>",

God often referred to them as a pleasing aroma to him. Jesus was the sacrifice on the cross. Paul and the other evangelists are like the aroma of that sacrifice.

(In 2:14 the metaphor refers to Christ’s victory.) In some languages the metaphor would not have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Explain the metaphor in your translation.

Paul and the other evangelists did things that pleased God. Their deeds were done among believers. The believers rejoiced in God when they saw those deeds, as a crowd reacts positively to a good smell. The phrase here refers to doing those things among believers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>which spreads among those who are being saved (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>those who are being saved:</strong> The clause <em>who are being saved</em> is passive. It is God who saves people. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> is saving</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek clause indicates that God is saving people at the present time.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>saved:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>saved</em> means “to rescue someone from danger or trouble.” In this context it refers to rescuing someone from the spiritual dangers of sin and the punishment that result from it. God will save people from the punishment that results from sin. In your translation, you may need to make explicit what people are saved from. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>saved <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from sin/hell</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>saved <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from the punishment of their sins</span></p></blockquote><h4>2:15c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:15c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and those who are perishing.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and those whom God destroys.</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">among</span> those who are on the road/way to being destroyed.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We also please God by serving Jesus</span> among those whom God will destroy.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those who are perishing:</strong> This clause refers to people who will die as an enemy of God.

The second clause, <em>to the other, a fragrance that brings life</em>, refers to 2:15b. This is good Greek style. In some languages it is more natural to have the clauses in the same order as in 2:15.

If possible, emphasize this phrase in your translation.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we are an odor of death and demise:</strong> The Greek phrase is literally “a smell out of death to death.” There are several ways to interpret this clause:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The phrase <u>“out of” refers to the kind of smell</u>. The word <u>“to” refers to the effect of the smell</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the smell of death leading to death (NJB) <em>(NJB, GNT, NABRE, CEV, REB, NCV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p><u>Translate literally</u>.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>an odor from death to death (NET) <em>(RSV, NASB, NET, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The phrase “out of death to death” is based on a <u>Hebrew idiom</u> that emphasizes the word <em>death</em>.

If possible, emphasize this phrase in your translation.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a fragrance that brings life:</strong> The Greek phrase is literally “a smell out of life to life.” Follow the same option here as you did in 2:16a:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Following option (1) above, the NJB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the smell of life leading to life (NJB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Following option (2) above, the NET says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a fragrance from life to life (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Following option (3) above, the GW says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we are a life-giving fragrance (GW)</p></blockquote></li></ol><h4>2:16c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:16c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And who is qualified for such a task?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But can anyone be adequate/sufficient to do this work?</p></li><li><p>Certainly no one is able to hold this responsibility.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And:</strong> In 2:14b Paul talked about life as an apostle of Jesus. In 2:14c–16b he talked about the effect of his ministry. In 2:16c he said that doing the work of an apostle is impossible without God helping him. There is some contrast here. In some languages it is more natural to translate the contrast here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages do not need to translate the conjunction to indicate the contrast.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who is qualified for such a task?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. It emphasizes the fact that no one is equal to such a task. Translate this clause with that meaning. Some ways are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>is anyone equal to the task?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>can anyone be equal to the task?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Who could think himself adequate for a responsibility like this?

In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that Paul was saying that no one can be an apostle. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain the meaning in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Here Paul said that he did not have the ability to do a good job as an apostle. But he also knew that God had empowered him to do a good job (1 Corinthians 15:9–10; 2 Corinthians 3:5).</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>is qualified:</strong> This phrase refers to being able to do something.

He puts nine kilograms of grain on the scale, but the scale reads ten kilograms. In that way he can sell it at the price of ten kilograms of grain and make extra money.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word can also indicate that the seller changes the product in such a way that he makes more money. For example, a wine seller may only partially fill bottles with wine and fill them the rest of the way with water. In that way he can sell more bottles of wine at the full price.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul used this Greek word figuratively. Using it here, he probably ridiculed the false teachers who had come to Corinth. The reason they preached was to have people pay them for preaching. They did not preach to help those listening (11:7). They also changed the gospel (11:4) so that the hearers would be more eager to accept them and give them money. Here is a way to translate this that includes both of these meanings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>hucksters who preach for personal profit (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">(Here the word “hucksters” refers figuratively to the false teachers deceiving the listeners in what they say.) Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>aim to make money by changing the word of God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>preach a corrupted word of God in order to make money</p></blockquote><h4>2:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But we <span data-bnType=\"implied\">always</span> speak sincerely through Christ in the presence of God,</p></li><li><p>But we speak with <span data-bnType=\"implied\">complete</span> sincerity as Christ’s spokesmen <span data-bnType=\"implied\">standing</span> before God,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity:</strong> The Greek clause is literally “but as from sincerity…we speak in Christ before God.” The phrase “as from sincerity” contrasts with the deceivers in 2:17a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but in Christ we speak as persons of sincerity…and standing in his presence (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in Christ:</strong> This phrase probably means “through our union with Christ” or “in the cause of Christ.” Paul’s relationship with Jesus enabled him to preach accurately and sincerely. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>As Christ’s spokesmen (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as servants of Christ (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>through Christ</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we speak before God:</strong> Paul knew that God sees all things, so Paul always spoke truthfully. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in the sight of God we speak (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sincerity:</strong> This word refers to having pure motives. Paul and the others did not do anything for selfish or wrong reasons. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>true/straight motives</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for no evil reasons</p></blockquote><h4>2:17c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:17c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>as men sent from God.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>as people whom God has sent.</p></li><li><p>because God has sent us <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with his message</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as men sent from God:</strong> God chose Paul and the other evangelists to go and tell others about Jesus.

In this section, Paul wrote about some of the false teachings of these men. Since they were Jews, Paul referred to people and events in the Old Testament, such as the tablets of stone (3:3), Moses (3:7), and Moses’ veil (3:13). They probably brought letters from other false teachers who said the false teachers in Corinth taught truthfully (3:1–3). The false teachers taught that believers must obey the Jewish laws. But Paul said that believers follow the new covenant with Jesus and not the old covenant with the Jews (3:14). He also spoke against their secret and shameful ways and said that they corrupted God’s word (4:2). Throughout this section Paul also encouraged the believers to follow Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Ministry That Comes From Christ Is Greater Than Moses’ Ministry (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The new covenant is greater than the law of Moses</p></blockquote></div><h4>3:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Are we beginning to commend ourselves again?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Can it be that we<sup>(excl)</sup> begin to commend ourselves <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> again?</p></li><li><p>¶ We certainly do not begin to recommend ourselves <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to you</span> again!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Are we beginning to commend ourselves again?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not think that we begin to commend ourselves again!</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>commend ourselves:</strong> This word refers to introducing or recommending someone to someone else. If someone is well known to a group, someone else may come to him and ask him to introduce him to the group. That way the group can trust the new person. There are two ways to interpret this word:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The word means <u>introduce</u> or <u>recommend</u> here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>produce our credentials (REB) <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, NJB, NASB, NABRE, GW, NET, REB, ESV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The word means <u>boast</u> here.

It emphasizes the fact that Paul and the others did not need letters of recommendation to the believers in Corinth or from them. But the false teachers did need such letters of recommendation. Translate this clause with that meaning. Some ways are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Surely we do not need, as some do, letters of recommendation to you or from you, do we? (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Can it be that we need letters of recommendation to you or from you, as some people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">need them</span>?</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement.

But the theme of this verse refers generally to Paul’s relationship to the believers in Corinth. So you should not translate this phrase as ridicule. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as some do (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>like some other people (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>letters of recommendation:</strong> This phrase refers to letters that others would write saying that a particular person was a good person and worthy of being accepted. In Acts 15:23–27, the believers in Jerusalem recommended Judas and Silas to the believers in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia. In Acts 18:27, when Apollos wanted to go to Achaia, the believers in Ephesus “wrote to the disciples there to welcome him.” Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>letters of commendation (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>letters that recommend us (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>letters…to tell others about us (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>letters of introduction (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a letter saying that this man is good</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to you:</strong> Paul evangelized in Corinth, so the believers in Corinth knew him, and he did not need letters of recommendation to give to them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>from you:</strong> When Paul went to new places, he probably allowed his teaching and deeds to indicate that he was a true apostle of Jesus. So he did not need the believers in Corinth to write letters of recommendation on his behalf.</p>",

Paul helped people believe in Christ and follow him. He did that by the power of Christ. Other people saw the changes and realized that Christ had caused the changes. This was like reading a letter and seeing who had written it. In some languages this metaphor will not have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate the metaphor as a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are like a letter from Christ</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Explain the meaning in your translation.

The Greek phrase probably refers to a metaphor of Christ writing the letter. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a letter written by Christ (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Christ:</strong> The word <em>Christ</em> is a title for Jesus and means “the anointed one.” See how you translated this word in 1:1.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages people always use both names “Jesus Christ” and never the title <em>Christ</em> alone. If that is true in your language, you may want to include the name “Jesus” here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus</span> Christ</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the result of our ministry:</strong> The Greek is literally “served/helped/cared-for by us.” This phrase continues the metaphor of the letter of Christ. This phrase refers figuratively to ministering to the people in Corinth, including when Paul preached the first time. Teaching and helping others are included as well. Paul and the other evangelists did all these things and in that way helped/served the letter of Christ, namely the believers in Corinth. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>by means of what we did <span data-bnType=\"implied\">among you</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because of our<sup>(excl)</sup> work to you<sup>(plur)</sup></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>entrusted to our care (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>given to us to deliver (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages continuing the metaphor is not natural. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain the meaning in your translation, as the BSB does.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>written <u>with the Spirit of the living God</u> and not with ink</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause refers figuratively to the Holy Spirit changing the lives of believers. Others see the changes and know that they follow Jesus. This is like ink on a letter, showing the thoughts of the writer. The ink is the means of writing. Similarly, the Holy Spirit is the means of changed lives. Many English versions use the word <em>with</em> here. Another way to translate this clause is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>written <u>by means of</u> the Spirit of the living God and not with ink</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages the metaphor is not natural. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate as a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>written <u>as if</u> with the Spirit of the living God and not with ink</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>written not with ink but the Spirit of the living God, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who causes your lives to be an example of Jesus, like a letter telling others about him</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate literally and explain the meaning in a footnote. An example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Holy Spirit causes a believer’s life to be an example of Jesus. This is like a letter telling others about him, because others see the believer’s faith and changed life.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>written not with ink:</strong> This phrase indicates that the letter of 3:3a is only a metaphor. In some languages it is more natural to indicate that this phrase refers to the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not <u>actually</u> written with ink</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>written <u>in reality</u> not with ink</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>ink:</strong> This word refers to a colored liquid that dries on paper (or other similar materials) and permanently marks it. The words in books are usually written with black <em>ink</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Spirit of the living God:</strong> This phrase refers to the Holy Spirit. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer to another spirit. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Explain in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Holy</span> Spirit of the living God</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate literally and explain the meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul described the Holy Spirit in this way.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>living God:</strong> The word <em>living</em> here refers to God being alive, as opposed to idols, which are not alive. Some other examples for translating are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the alive God<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This expression should not imply in your language that He is one of many “gods.”</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the God who lives <span data-bnType=\"implied\">forever</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages people assume that God lives, so the phrase “the living God” is not natural. If that is true in your language, you may want to translate the meaning in another way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the God who never dies</p></blockquote><h4>3:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">written</span> on tablets/plaques of human hearts and not on tablets/plaques of stone.</p></li><li><p>and was written not on writing stones <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of laws to be obeyed</span> but on the inner being of people.</p></li><li><p>He changed the spirit/hearts of people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to follow him</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like writing a letter for all to see</span> and not on stone slabs <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of laws to follow</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts:</strong> The verb “written” is implied from 3:3b but not repeated here. In some languages it is more natural to repeat the verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>written</u> not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The negative phrase is first (<em>not on tablets of stone</em>) and the positive phrase is second. In some languages it is more natural to have the positive phrase first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>written <u>on tablets of human hearts</u> and not on tablets of stone</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">These phrases continue the metaphor but now focus on the thing that is written upon. They figuratively indicate that the believers’ hearts are changed. So the believers act and speak based on their faith, and people can see the change, like reading a letter. In some languages the metaphor is not natural. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate as a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>written <u>as if</u> on human hearts like a tablet and not on tablets of stone</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>written not on tablets of stone but <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ changed your</span> hearts <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to follow him, like writing a letter</span> upon them <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for all to see</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate literally and explain the meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>These words indicate that the change to follow Jesus happens at the deepest level in a person. The changes are not just rules to follow like the Ten Commandments, which were written on tablets of stone. These changes at the deepest level in a person also change the way he lives for others to see.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>tablets of stone:</strong> This phrase refers to the Ten Commandments (Exodus 24:12, 31:18). The writing was carved into the stone. In some languages a literal translation would not imply the Ten Commandments. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Explain in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>tablets of stone <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of laws to obey/follow</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate literally and explain the meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This phrase refers to the Ten Commandments (Exodus 24:12, 31:18). People could publicly obey the laws but still have an unchanged heart that disobeyed God.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>tablets:</strong> This word indicates the stones were flat, wide, and tall, and not very thick. The word <em>tablets</em> refers to something to write on. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p><u>flat</u> stones</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>stones <u>flat like tablets</u></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>flat stones to write on</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>tablets of human hearts:</strong> This phrase refers figuratively to <em>hearts</em> as if they were a place on which to write. The word <em>tablets</em> is used here to emphasize the difference between <em>human hearts</em> and <u>stone</u>. If the word <em>tablets</em> is not natural as a metaphor or simile, emphasize the difference between <em>human hearts</em> and <u>stone</u> in another way. This may include explaining the difference. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>human hearts, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">which affect the whole person, unlike stone</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>hearts:</strong> Here the word “heart” refers to the center and source of inner life, that is, thinking, feeling, and will. Use a term that is normally used in your language for “inner life” or the place where words are thought of. It may be a different organ such as the liver, or it may be a general term such as “insides.”</p>",

In this section, Paul wrote about some of the false teachings of these men. Since they were Jews, Paul referred to people and events in the Old Testament, such as the tablets of stone (3:3), Moses (3:7), and Moses’ veil (3:13). They probably brought letters from other false teachers who said the false teachers in Corinth taught truthfully (3:1–3). The false teachers taught that believers must obey the Jewish laws. But Paul said that believers follow the new covenant with Jesus and not the old covenant with the Jews (3:14). He also spoke against their secret and shameful ways and said that they corrupted God’s word (4:2). Throughout this section Paul also encouraged the believers to follow Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Ministry That Comes From Christ Is Greater Than Moses’ Ministry (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The new covenant is greater than the law of Moses</p></blockquote></div><h4>3:7a–8</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul included a lot of information in a complicated sentence here. He asked a rhetorical question that expected a yes answer:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If the ministry of the old covenant came with glory, will not the ministry of the new covenant be even more glorious? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yes, it will be even more glorious!</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">3:7b and 3:7c–d are extra information about the ministry of the old covenant. The General Comment at the end of the notes on 3:8 shows some ways to place the extra information without losing the main point.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This whole sentence is written as a question. But 3:7 is a statement of facts based on the Old Testament. Only 3:8 is the actual question. Having only one sentence causes the reader to compare the old ministry (3:7) to the new ministry (3:8). In some languages it is more natural to have two sentences here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7</sup>Now the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, fading though it was. <sup>8</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">If that is true,</span> will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious?</p></blockquote><h4>3:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Now if the ministry of death,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ And the ministry <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the written laws</span> that brought death</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">The old covenant</span> caused the penalty of death. Now the work of serving <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that covenant</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Now:</strong> This word introduces another way in which the new covenant is different from the old covenant. It is not a time word. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Also,</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages can allow the context to indicate the introduction and do not need to translate this word.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the ministry of death:</strong> This phrase refers to the <em>ministry</em> based on the law of Moses. The priests served God by teaching those laws to the Jewish people. Some of the punishments were death, therefore Paul said that this ministry was <em>of death</em>. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the ministry <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the letter</span>, which brings death</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the ministry <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the old covenant</span> led to death</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the ministry <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the law of Moses</span> that brought death <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as punishment</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>ministry:</strong> This word usually refers to the work of serving, helping, or caring for others. But in this context, the word refers to the priests doing the work that the law of Moses required. Paul used this word here to compare it later to his ministry (3:8). Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>service</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>work</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>doing the work</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This word in important in 3:7–11. Translate it in a similar way each time.</p><h4>3:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>which was engraved in letters on stone, came with such glory</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and which was carved with letters in stone, began with glory/splendor,</p></li><li><p>started in glory/radiance. That work of serving is symbolized by the stone slabs that God wrote on.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>which was engraved in letters on stone:</strong> This clause tells the reader more about “the ministry of death.” It does not imply that there are other ministries that brought death and this one <em>was engraved in letters on stone</em>. Some languages must translate differently to indicate the correct meaning. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here or use parentheses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7b</sup>The ministry that brought death was engraved in letters on stone. <sup>7a</sup>Now if it <sup>7b</sup>came with glory,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now if the ministry that brought death came with glory (that ministry was engraved in letters on stone),</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>which <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> engraved in letters on stone</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>engraved:</strong> This word refers to carving into the stone. God carved the Ten Commandments into the stone tablets. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>carved (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>inscribed (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in letters:</strong> This phrase refers to the letters of the alphabet. God carved letters to make words and wrote the Ten Commandments. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>with letters</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in written form (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>on stone:</strong> God made grooves in the shapes of letters in the stone tablets. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in stone (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>on stone tablets (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>came with such glory:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>came</em> means “began to exist” here. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>occurred in such glory (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s glory appeared when it was given (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>glory:</strong> The word <em>glory</em> refers literally to a very bright light. In this context it implies power, majesty, and greatness. When God gave the Ten Commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai, there was thunder and lightning, smoke and fire (Exodus 19:16–19). In Moses’ second visit to the mountain, the glory of God caused Moses’ face to shine (Exodus 34:29). Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>splendor</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>radiance</p></blockquote><h4>3:7c–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that the Israelites could not gaze at the face of Moses because of its fleeting glory:</strong> Moses talked with God and his face began to shine brightly (Exodus 34:29). When Moses left, the glory/radiance on his face began to fade. In some languages a literal translation would not make clear how Moses’ face became radiant. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Explain in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Moses’ face also received some of that glory</span> so that the Israelites could not look steadily at it because of its fleeting glory, fading as it was</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate literally and explain the meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Moses went to God so that God could give the Ten Commandments to him. The Ten Commandments were the first part of the old covenant. During that time, God gave him other laws, and on one occasion Moses asked to see God’s glory. Upon seeing it, his face began to shine brightly. After he left, the glory/radiance on his face began to fade.</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>3:7c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:7c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that the Israelites could not gaze at the face of Moses</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that the people of Israel could not stare/gaze at Moses’ face</p></li><li><p>Moses’ face <span data-bnType=\"implied\">also received some of that glory</span> and so the Israelites could only glance at it <span data-bnType=\"implied\">before looking away</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Israelites:</strong> The ending -ite means “a person of.” This word refers to the group of people named Israel. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the people of Israel (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>could not gaze:</strong> After Moses visited God on the mountain, his face shone very brightly. It shone so brightly that it hurt the eyes of those trying to look at him, so they <em>could not gaze</em> at him. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>could not look intently (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>could not stare</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>could only glance</p></blockquote><h4>3:7d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:7d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because of its fleeting glory,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because its glory was so bright, even though it was fading.</p></li><li><p>because of the glory/brightness/radiance, even though that glory was dimming.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>fleeting:</strong> The glory on Moses’ face gradually dimmed. The glory shone less each day. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that glory later dimmed</p></blockquote>",

They probably brought letters from other false teachers who said the false teachers in Corinth taught truthfully (3:1–3). The false teachers taught that believers must obey the Jewish laws.

The word “indeed” probably indicates emphasis, because 3:10 makes a stronger contrast between the old and new ministries. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For indeed (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Furthermore</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>what was once glorious:</strong> The word <em>what</em> refers to the ministry of the old covenant, which Paul also called the “ministry of condemnation” (3:9a). If people will not clearly understand that the word <em>what</em> refers to the ministry of the old covenant, you may want to explain that in your translation. Use a similar word or phrase for “ministry” as in 3:7a or 3:9a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">ministry of the law of Moses</span> that was glorious</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the work of serving <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the old covenant</span> that had glory</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>has no glory now in comparison to the glory that surpasses it:</strong> This clause uses an opposite meaning (<em>has no glory</em>) to emphasize that the new ministry has much more glory than the old ministry. It is like the moon which shines with the same brightness day and night, but is hardly noticed during the day because the sun is so much brighter. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>has lost all claim to glory, by contrast with the glory which transcends it (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>was not glorious at all compared with the overwhelming glory of the new way (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">is as if it</span> has no glory in comparison to the much greater glory <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the new covenant</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to use opposites instead of a comparison.

It does not imply that there were other people named Moses and this was the only one with <em>a veil over his face</em>. Some languages must translate differently to indicate the correct meaning. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>13a</sup>We are not like Moses. He would put a veil over his face <sup>13b</sup>to keep the Israelites from gazing at it while the radiance was fading away.</p></blockquote><h4>3:13a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:13a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>We<sup>(excl)</sup> are not like Moses, who used to put a veil/covering over his face</p></li><li><p>We do not do as Moses did when he would put a veil/cloth over his face</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>We are not like Moses:</strong> Moses hid the fading glory, but Paul and the other evangelists were bold. Moses hid the glory, but this does not imply that he was dishonest or timid. The comparison is explained in the rest of 3:13. Your translation should clearly compare Paul and the others to this part of Moses’ life. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>13a</sup>Moses would put a veil over his face <sup>13b</sup>to keep the Israelites from gazing at it while the radiance was fading away. <sup>13a</sup><u>But we do not do as he did</u>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who would put a veil over his face:</strong> Moses would go into the tent of meeting to talk directly with God, and Moses’ face received some of God’s glory. He did not wear the veil when he was with God. When he went and spoke to the people, his face shone with that glory. After he finished speaking to them, he <em>would put a veil over his face</em> (Exodus 34:33–35). Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who put a covering over his face (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>His face was shining, but he covered it (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>veil:</strong> This word refers to a piece of cloth that covers a person’s face. Some veils are thin and cover the whole face, but the person can still see through the cloth. Other veils only cover the face below the eyes.</p><h4>3:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to keep the Israelites from gazing at the end of what was fading away.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to prevent the people of Israel from watching the end of it as it faded.</p></li><li><p>so that the people of Israel would not see the thing/glory fade to nothing.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to keep the Israelites from gazing at:</strong> Here the words <em>keep…from</em> mean “prevent.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that the people of Israel would not see (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the end of what was fading away:</strong> The Greek phrase is literally “the end of the thing fading away.” It refers to the glory that faded after Moses left God’s presence.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that same veil remains unlifted (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is passive. God removes the veil when an Israelite believes.

In this section, Paul wrote about some of the false teachings of these men. Since they were Jews, Paul referred to people and events in the Old Testament, such as the tablets of stone (3:3), Moses (3:7), and Moses’ veil (3:13). They probably brought letters from other false teachers who said the false teachers in Corinth taught truthfully (3:1–3). The false teachers taught that believers must obey the Jewish laws. But Paul said that believers follow the new covenant with Jesus and not the old covenant with the Jews (3:14). He also spoke against their secret and shameful ways and said that they corrupted God’s word (4:2). Throughout this section Paul also encouraged the believers to follow Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Ministry That Comes From Christ Is Greater Than Moses’ Ministry (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The new covenant is greater than the law of Moses</p></blockquote></div><h4>3:15</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:15\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But/Even to this day a veil <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of dullness</span> covers their hearts whenever <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the books of</span> Moses are read.</p></li><li><p>From then until now, when they read <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the books of</span> Moses, that dullness prevents them from truly understanding.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And even to this day:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>And even</em> is literally “but.” There is contrast between the veil being removed when an Israelite believes (3:14d) and the veil remaining for those who follow the old covenant, so many English versions translate this conjunction as “but.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But until this very day (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, other English versions do not translate the conjunction as “But,” since 3:15 agrees with the veil not being removed, which is the main idea in 3:14c–d. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Yes, to this day (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>when Moses is read:</strong> The name <em>Moses</em> refers figuratively to the books that Moses wrote.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the books of</span> Moses are read</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is passive.

The phrase means “begins to believe in God,” since the word <em>Lord</em> refers to God in 3:17. But Paul implied believing in Jesus as the Christ and the new covenant that he began (3:6–15). In some languages a literal translation would not indicate the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Explain in your translation.

It does not imply that there are other believers and only these believers have <em>unveiled faces</em>. Some languages must translate this clause differently to indicate the correct meaning. One way to do that is to have the who-clause as a separate sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We all reflect the Lord’s glory with unveiled faces. And we…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we:</strong> This pronoun refers to all people who follow Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>who with unveiled faces all reflect the glory of the Lord:</strong> There are several ways to interpret the Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>reflect</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The word means <u>reflect as in a mirror or as in still water</u>.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>see as in a mirror (REB) <em>(NRSV, NASB, REB, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The word just means <u>see (something)</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>beholding (RSV) <em>(RSV, NABRE, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Keener (on TW) says “the basis of his image is simply how Moses reflected God’s glory.…like Moses, they are transformed to reflect God’s glory by the Spirit.” Louw defines the Greek word as “to reflect light or visual patterns coming from some source.”</span></span> You should not follow interpretation (3), because that would be an unusual meaning of the Greek word.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>unveiled faces:</strong> This phrase indicates that the faces of believers are not covered.

In this section, Paul wrote about some of the false teachings of these men. Since they were Jews, Paul referred to people and events in the Old Testament, such as the tablets of stone (3:3), Moses (3:7), and Moses’ veil (3:13). They probably brought letters from other false teachers who said the false teachers in Corinth taught truthfully (3:1–3). The false teachers taught that believers must obey the Jewish laws. But Paul said that believers follow the new covenant with Jesus and not the old covenant with the Jews (3:14). He also spoke against their secret and shameful ways and said that they corrupted God’s word (4:2).

Some examples for translating <em>mercy</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>compassion</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>pity</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>this ministry:</strong> This phrase refers to the new ministry of the Spirit (3:6–18).

Paul and the others refuse to do anything that was secret and shameful. Here the word does <u>not</u> imply that Paul and the others had done secret and shameful things in the past but had stopped by the time that he wrote this. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>refused to have anything to do with</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>reject all (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>turned our backs on all</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>secret and shameful ways:</strong> The Greek phrase is literally “secret things/deeds of shame.” Here the word <em>secret</em> implies that these deeds were wrong and that was why people did them secretly. These deeds were also <em>shameful</em>. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>secret and shameful deeds (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the deeds that people hide for very shame (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>shameful:</strong> This word indicates that the people doing these deeds would have been ashamed if someone had discovered that they were doing them. It does not mean that they were too ashamed to do them or that they are ashamed while doing them.</p><h4>4:2b–e</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">The Greek uses participles to indicate that 4:2b–e explains “we have renounced secret and shameful ways.” Some English versions also use participles. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2b</sup>not <u>walking</u> in craftiness <sup>2c</sup>or <u>adulterating</u> the word of God, <sup>2d</sup>but by the manifestation of truth <sup>2e</sup><u>commending</u> ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In your translation, indicate that 4:2b–e explains 4:2a. Several English versions indicate the connection by using a semi-colon (;) at the end of 4:2a. Another way to do so is with a conjunction. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Namely,</span> <sup>2b</sup>we do not use deception, <sup>2c</sup>nor do we distort the word of God, <sup>2d</sup>but on the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly <sup>2e</sup>we commend ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">for</span> <sup>2b</sup>we do not use deception, <sup>2c</sup>nor do we distort the word of God, <sup>2d</sup>but on the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly <sup>2e</sup>we commend ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God</p></blockquote><h4>4:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>We do not practice deceit,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">for</span> we do not act with cunning/deceit,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">That is,</span> we never try to cleverly deceive,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>We do not practice deceit:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>deceit</em> means “cunning” or “trickery.” Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we do not act with deceit (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we do not cunningly/slyly deceive</p></blockquote><h4>4:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>nor do we distort the word of God.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>nor do we give wrong/false meaning to God’s word,</p></li><li><p>and we never change God’s message to deceive <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>nor do we:</strong> The word <em>nor</em> means “and not.” Another way to translate this phrase is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and we do not</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>distort the word of God:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>distort</em> refers to changing something so it is no longer pure. Here the verb refers to not telling the true meaning of <em>the word of God</em>. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>tamper with God’s word (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>falsify the word of God (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>give wrong meaning to the word of God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>change the teaching of God (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the word of God:</strong> This phrase refers to the Old Testament.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by open proclamation of the truth:</strong> This phrase indicates the way in which Paul and the others commended themselves (4:2e). Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>by showing the truth openly (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we proclaim the truth plainly and so</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>open proclamation:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>open proclamation</em> refers to announcing or proclaiming something. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>clearly reveal (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the truth:</strong> Here the word <em>truth</em> refers to teachings that are not false/lies. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>what we teach truthfully</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>true teachings</p></blockquote><h4>4:2e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:2e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>we commend ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and so we support/approve ourselves before God to every person’s conscience.</p></li><li><p>and in that way we show to ourselves that we have done well to every person’s inner being, as God knows.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we commend ourselves:</strong> Here the word <em>commend</em> refers to saying they are good people. The way Paul and the others taught indicated that they were good people, because they always spoke the truth. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we recommend ourselves (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we show that we are good people</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate the word <em>commend</em> as you did in 3:1.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>every man’s:</strong> The word <em>man’s</em> is general and refers to both men and women here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>everyone’s (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>conscience:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>conscience</em> refers to the memories of past deeds. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>inner being</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>convictions of the mind</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 1:12.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the sight of God:</strong> The Greek phrase is literally “before God” (as in the NET). The phrase indicates that God approved of Paul and the others. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As God watches (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God is our witness (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase describes the phrase “we commend ourselves.” It does <u>not</u> describe the phrase “every man’s conscience.”</p>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>even if our gospel is veiled:</strong> This clause uses the same metaphor of a veil as in 3:15. Here Paul explained that some people do not clearly understand the gospel of Jesus. He explained who those people are in 4:3b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If our gospel seems to be veiled at all (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you translated the figurative meaning of “veil” in 3:15, you may want to do so here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if the meaning of our gospel is hidden</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>even:</strong> Here the word <em>even</em> emphasizes the words that follow. Another way to translate this word is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if our gospel is <u>indeed</u> veiled</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>our gospel:</strong> The pronoun <em>our</em> indicates here that Paul and the other evangelists preach this gospel. The pronoun does not indicate that the gospel is about them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the gospel that we preach</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>gospel:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates here as <em>gospel</em> is sometimes translated as “good news.” In the New Testament the Greek word refers to the good news that Jesus is the Christ. See how you translated this word in 2:12.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>is veiled:</strong> The word <em>veiled</em> describes the gospel. This clause refers to the gospel <u>already being veiled</u> rather than the act of veiling. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>is covered with a veil (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>veiled:</strong> This word is a metaphor. It refers to the gospel being unclear to people who do not believe in Jesus (4:3b). In some languages a literal translation would not have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Keep the metaphor and explain the meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The word “veiled” indicates that the meaning of the gospel is unclear, just as a veil makes it hard to see the face behind it. See 3:14–16.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning of the metaphor in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>unclear</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>uncertain <em>You may then want to indicate the literal word in a footnote.

If possible, describe the gospel as already being hidden. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>it is so</u> to those who are on the way to destruction (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the gospel <u>is hidden</u> regarding those who are perishing</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>those who are perishing:</strong> This phrase refers to those people who do not follow Jesus. The verb <em>perishing</em> refers to dying, but it also implies destruction or ruin. The present tense may indicate that these people are on the path that leads to death and destruction.

In this section, Paul wrote about some of the false teachings of these men. Since they were Jews, Paul referred to people and events in the Old Testament, such as the tablets of stone (3:3), Moses (3:7), and Moses’ veil (3:13). They probably brought letters from other false teachers who said the false teachers in Corinth taught truthfully (3:1–3). The false teachers taught that believers must obey the Jewish laws. But Paul said that believers follow the new covenant with Jesus and not the old covenant with the Jews (3:14). He also spoke against their secret and shameful ways and said that they corrupted God’s word (4:2). Throughout this section Paul also encouraged the believers to follow Jesus.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Ministry That Comes From Christ Is Greater Than Moses’ Ministry (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The new covenant is greater than the law of Moses</p></blockquote></div><h4>4:5a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:5a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For we do not proclaim ourselves,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For we<sup>(excl)</sup> do not proclaim our importance,</p></li><li><p>For <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in our ministry,</span> it is not ourselves that we preach/announce.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> Here the word <em>For</em> indicates that 4:5 explains some things Paul had said about their ministry of preaching the gospel of Jesus (4:1–4).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>proclaim ourselves:</strong> This phrase refers to preaching in a way that would have made Paul and the others seem important. Paul did not preach for the purpose of becoming famous. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>preach ourselves (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Our message is not about ourselves (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>preach about ourselves (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>proclaim:</strong> This word means “announce” or “preach.” Paul and the others announced that Jesus was the Christ to people in Corinth. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>preach (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 1:19.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>ourselves:</strong> This word is emphasized in the Greek. It emphasizes the contrast with what they do preach (4:5b). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>it is not ourselves</u> that we preach (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>4:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but Jesus Christ as Lord,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but that Jesus Christ is Lord,</p></li><li><p>Rather, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we preach/announce</span> that Jesus Christ is ruler <span data-bnType=\"implied\">over all</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but Jesus Christ as Lord:</strong> The words “we preach” are implied from 4:5a but are not repeated here. In some languages it is more natural to repeat some of those words. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we preach</span> Jesus Christ as Lord</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Jesus Christ as Lord:</strong> This phrase refers to explaining that Jesus Christ is the Lord. That is, he is the one who, with God, rules all things. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We preach that <u>Jesus Christ is Lord</u> (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Jesus Christ:</strong> There is a textual issue here. Some Greek manuscripts have “Christ Jesus” instead of <em>Jesus Christ</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The order is <u>Jesus Christ</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jesus Christ (RSV) <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NABRE, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, NCV, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The order is <u>Christ Jesus</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ Jesus (NASB) <em>(NJB, NASB, REB, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1), since the UBS Greek New Testament recommends it.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Lord:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Lord</em> means “the one in authority over (something)” or “master.” It refers to someone greater in status or power. Jesus is ruler over all things. Another way to translate this word is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>ruler <span data-bnType=\"implied\">over all things</span></p></blockquote><h4>4:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and that we ourselves serve/help you<sup>(plur)</sup> because of Jesus.</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we made</span> ourselves to be your humble helpers/servants in obedience to Jesus.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake:</strong> There is no verb in this clause. The words “we proclaim” are implied from 4:5a but are not repeated here. In this context it indicates that Paul and the other evangelists considered themselves to be servants of the believers in Corinth. They helped the believers so that they believed, loved, and obeyed Jesus well. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we made</span> ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we told you that</span> we were your servants for Jesus’ sake</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>servants:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>servants</em> is literally “slaves.” The word “slaves” figuratively indicates that Paul and the other evangelists cared for the needs of the believers in Corinth. They were humble and submissive to the believers. The difference between a slave and a servant is not important here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages do not have a word for “servant” or “slave.” If that is true in your language, you may want to use a general term for “worker” or use a phrase that includes humility or submission. Some examples are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>workers</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who serve</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>humble helpers</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for Jesus’ sake:</strong> The Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>for Jesus’ sake</em> can be literally translated as “because of Jesus.” Paul and the others served the believers to honor Jesus and in response to what Jesus had done for them. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because of Jesus</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to honor Jesus</p></blockquote>",

This sentence is not an exact quote of those verses in Genesis, but it has the same meaning. You may want to indicate that God said this long ago. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God, who said <span data-bnType=\"implied\">long ago</span>, “Let light shine out of darkness”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>God, who said:</strong> The Greek words are literally “God, the one having said.” This phrase emphasizes the word <em>God</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It is God who said (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Let light shine out of darkness:</strong> The Greek clause is literally “out of darkness light will shine.” The phrase <em>out of darkness</em> is emphasized in the Greek clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>Out of darkness</u> the light shall shine! (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek clause uses the future tense as a command for light to begin shining. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Out of darkness, light, shine!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May light shine out of darkness</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is similar to Genesis 1:3. The BSB and other English versions indicate that in a footnote or cross-reference. You may want to do that here.</p><h4>4:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>made His light shine in our hearts</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>is the one who shone in our<sup>(incl)</sup> hearts</p></li><li><p>and he <span data-bnType=\"implied\">also</span> gave to us understanding like a light in our hearts/minds.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>made His light shine in our hearts:</strong> This phrase is the main point, with the words “who said, ‘Let light shine out of darkness,’ ” as supporting information. (4:6c is the purpose for shining in the hearts of believers.)</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek clause is literally “who shone in our hearts.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who has shone in our hearts (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is a metaphor. It indicates that God caused believers to understand the gospel. In some languages a literal translation would not have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Change it to a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it is as of he shone in our hearts</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Explain the meaning in your translation.

In your language, refer to that part of people. This may be another organ such as the liver or generally the “insides” of a person.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Your language may not use a part of the body for a figurative meaning of true understanding. In that case, translate the meaning without the metaphor.

He, Martin, and Barnett support only “Christ.” But Thrall and Kistemaker support “Jesus Christ.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ:</strong> This clause refers figuratively to understanding the gospel that reveals God’s glory. The way Jesus lived revealed God’s glory. The word <em>knowledge</em> refers to the things that people know about who Jesus is, namely the gospel. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to enlighten them with the knowledge of God’s glory, the glory on the face of Christ (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to bring us the knowledge of God’s glory shining in the face of Christ (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so we could know the glory of God that is seen in the face of Jesus Christ (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>to give us the light:</strong> This indicates purpose. God has already given this light to us. But in some languages purpose clauses are only used to indicate something that hasn’t happened yet. If that is true in your language, indicate that this has already happened. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>and so gave us the light</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>in the face of Jesus Christ:</strong> This phrase refers to who Jesus is. He reveals God’s glory. The phrase also connects to 3:13 and contrasts with Moses’ face having only temporary glory. In some languages a literal translation would not clearly indicate the contrast with Moses and the old covenant. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>This phrase refers to who Jesus is. He reveals God’s glory. But it also connects to 3:13 and contrasts with Moses’ face having only temporary glory.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Since the phrase <em>the face of Jesus Christ</em> refers figuratively to Christ’s life, you may want to translate in a way that refers generally to Christ’s life. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in Christ’s life</p></blockquote>",

He referred to their bodies as jars of clay (4:7a), which are easily shattered. He said this to show that our human nature is weak and easily fails as we follow God. But Paul was also encouraged that God enabled him to do the work of the new covenant in spite of great difficulties (4:7b–9).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">He wrote that he and the other evangelists experienced things similar to what Jesus experienced before he died, but those experiences showed to other people how Jesus lived (4:10–11). He wrote that the believers experienced the good effects of Jesus’ life (4:12). He supported his ministry of preaching with a quote from the Old Testament (4:13), and he explained the promise there (4:14). He wrote that their ministry benefited the believers in Corinth and others as well (4:15).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Lastly, Paul wrote how they continue in spite of the difficulties (4:16–18).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Spiritual Treasure in Clay Jars (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Even though our bodies are weak, God gives us strength to tell the gospel</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A glorious, powerful message taught by weak messengers</p></blockquote></div><h4>4:8–11</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In these verses Paul gave examples of the ways in which he and the other evangelists were weak, but God repeatedly gave them the power to continue. The BSB uses the present tense to indicate that these clauses are general examples. Translate in a way that indicates that these clauses are general examples. They were not experiences that only happened once.</p><h4>4:8a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:8a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>We are hard pressed on all sides, but not crushed;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>All kinds of hardships/troubles come/press against us<sup>(excl)</sup>, but we are not overwhelmed/conquered;</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">For example,</span> although we undergo/experience difficulties/suffering in all kinds of ways, they do not crush/defeat us.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>We are hard pressed</strong> In some languages it may be helpful to begin this section with a phrase indicating that Paul is giving examples:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>For example</u>, we are hard pressed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>We are hard pressed</em> refers to both the outward trouble a person experiences and the suffering a person experiences from that trouble. The Greek word includes people oppressing Paul and the others but refers also to any kind of difficulty or hardship. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We experience trouble/oppression</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We undergo hardships/suffering</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this Greek word (“are afflicted”) in 1:6.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>on all sides:</strong> The Greek phrase is literally “in every (way).” Paul and the others experienced all kinds of oppression and hardship. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>every kind of</u> hardship (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but not crushed:</strong> The words “we are” are implied from 4:8a but are not repeated here. In some languages it is more natural to repeat those words. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but we are not crushed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>crushed:</strong> This word refers figuratively to being overwhelmed by the oppression or hardship (4:8a). In some languages it is more natural to translate the meaning without the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>defeated (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>overwhelmed</p></blockquote><h4>4:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>perplexed, but not in despair;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">and</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we are</span> bewildered, but <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we</span> are never overwhelmed by sorrow/woe.</p></li><li><p>Although we often do not know what to do <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about what is happening</span>, we never lose all hope.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>perplexed:</strong> This word means “uncertain.” Paul and the others with him sometimes did not know what was happening and therefore did not know what to do. The words “we are” are implied from 4:8a but are not repeated here. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>uncertain <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about what is happening</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we are puzzled (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>bewildered (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We do not know what to do (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We are <span data-bnType=\"implied\">often</span> troubled and say to ourselves, “What shall we do now?”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in despair:</strong> A person may have a hardship or trouble. The word <em>despair</em> refers to that person having extreme sadness and seeing no way to do anything about the hardship or trouble. He no longer tries to do anything about it and no longer expects others to help him. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>completely dejected</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>despondent</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>lose all hope</p></blockquote>",

He spoke because he believed in God and trusted him.

It does not imply that the writer of this psalm no longer believed at the time he wrote this. Your translation should not imply that the writer no longer believed at the time of writing.</p><h4>4:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>we who have the same spirit of faith also believe and therefore speak,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>We<sup>(excl)</sup> also believe and therefore speak with that same spirit of believing,</p></li><li><p>In the same way, we also believe and therefore speak,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the same spirit of faith:</strong> Here the word <em>spirit</em> refers to an attitude. Paul had the same attitude of faith as the person who wrote the quote from the Old Testament. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>same kind of faith (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>faith:</strong> This word refers to strongly and sincerely believing in something or someone. This noun has the same meaning as the verb “believed” (4:13a). In some languages it is more natural to use a verb here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>believing</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>also believe and therefore speak:</strong> The verbs <em>believe</em> and <em>speak</em> are present tense. This may indicate that Paul and the others continued to believe and tell the gospel message at the time he wrote this letter.</p>",

He used the metaphor of a tent to refer to the earthly body and the metaphor of a building in heaven to refer to the heavenly body. Paul and his coworkers desired that the change would happen (5:2–4). He explained that God had given that desire and that God had also given the Holy Spirit so we can be assured that the promise of a heavenly body will be fulfilled (5:5).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Then Paul wrote that they were confident in their faith (5:6–8) and purposely chose to please God (5:9). He wrote the reason to do so, namely that all believers will be judged and rewarded by God for the things they have done (5:10).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul continued to use the pronoun “we” to refer to himself, Timothy, and others who traveled with him telling the good news about Jesus. But in some verses in this section, the pronoun “we” probably includes the believers in Corinth and therefore all believers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Our Heavenly Dwelling (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The mortal body that we have and the eternal body that God has promised</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Faith Guides Our Lives (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God has promised a new, eternal body and so we live by faith/believing</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The assurance of an eternal body and judgment compels us to please the Lord</p></blockquote></div><h4>5:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Now we know that if the earthly tent we live in is dismantled,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ For we<sup>(incl)</sup> know that should the earthly tent in which we live be destroyed,</p></li><li><p>¶ Furthermore, we know that if <span data-bnType=\"implied\">someone</span> destroys the temporary body that we have here on earth,</p></li><li><p>¶ We know that if this earthly body we live in like a tent is killed,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Now:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Now</em> is often translated as “for” or “because.” It is not a time word.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when (GNT) <em>(GNT, NJB, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because that is the usual meaning of the Greek word and because the interpretation of the word “destroyed” below allows for a possible event.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Thrall (p. 362) says it refers to <u>possible</u> destruction. Martin (pp. 102–103) and Hughes (on TW) indicate that Paul has in mind the time when Jesus will return for his people and change those still alive so that they do not experience death (1 Corinthians 15:50–52).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the earthly tent we live in is dismantled:</strong> There are two issues:</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><u>Issue 1: Meaning</u></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>dismantled</em> has several meanings. There are two ways to interpret the Greek word here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Greek word means <u>destroy</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the earthly tent which is our house is <u>torn down</u> (NASB) <em>(RSV, NIV, GNT, NASB, NABRE, CEV, REB, NCV, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Greek word means <u>disassemble</u>. A person removes a tent’s pegs and poles from the ground, then he folds the tent to get ready to move to a new place. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the tent that houses us on earth is <u>folded up</u> (NJB) <em>(BSB, NJB, NLT, GW, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because that is the usual meaning of the Greek word and because Paul was probably thinking of the persecution of 1:8–9 and wondering if someone might kill him for preaching about Jesus.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kruse (p. 112) refers to 4:16–5:10, where Paul wrote about the physical body “wasting away” through persecution and suffering. Thrall (p. 361) refers to “the prospect of death.” Harris (pp. 367, 371) translates the word as “is destroyed,” but allows that interpretation (2) is possible.</span></span> Meaning Line 1 in the Display is an example of interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><u>Issue 2: Passive</u></p><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is passive. It refers here to people destroying. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">someone</span> destroys the earthly tent we live in</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> destroy the earthly tent in which we live</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the earthly tent we live in:</strong> This phrase is a metaphor for our human bodies. A tent is a movable shelter. It is set up temporarily in one place and then taken down. Likewise, our earthly bodies only last while we live on earth. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>our earthly house, the tent we live in (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the tent that houses us on earth (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the tent that is our earthly home (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer only to an actual tent. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Translate it as a simile.

If that is true in your language, use the word for a temporary shelter in which someone might live for a short time.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>is dismantled:</strong> Here the word that the BSB translates as <em>dismantled</em> refers figuratively to being killed.

The Greek NT 4 indicates that there are three different verbs in the various ancient Greek manuscripts here. Two mean “unclothed” and one means “clothed.” The Greek NT 4 indicates a significant degree of doubt as to which is the original verb. Fourteen English versions in <em>Translator’s Workplace</em> follow the Greek verb that means “clothed.” It is recommended that you follow “clothed” here.Of the English versions in <em>Translator’s Workplace</em>, only the NRSV follows “unclothed.” The Greek NT 4 also recommends it. As “unclothed,” the verse would indicate that when we die and lose our earthly body (5:1a), we will not be “naked.” That means we will not exist as spirits only but will inhabit our eternal bodies.</span></span> The Greek clause is literally “if indeed also we are clothed.” Here the word “if” is used rhetorically. Paul believes <em>we are clothed</em> to be true. Using “if” requires that readers think about what Paul said and agree with him. The word does not express doubt here. Here the word “indeed” emphasizes the meaning of “if.” Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if we are indeed assured that we are clothed</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because it will clothe us so (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>After we have indeed clothed ourselves with it</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>when we are clothed:</strong> This clause continues the metaphor of wearing a body like clothing from 5:2b. It indicates that the person has already put on the clothes. It implies that the person has <u>not</u> removed the clothes. The clause looks at the time <u>after</u> the longing is fulfilled and the person has been clothed in 5:2b.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">many things</span> burden us</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">various things</span> cause us trouble</p></blockquote><h4>5:4c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:4c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because we do not wish to be unclothed</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>in that we have no desire to be stripped <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of it</span>,</p></li><li><p>insomuch as we do not want to leave our temporary bodies <span data-bnType=\"implied\">at death</span>,</p></li><li><p>For we do not wish to leave this earthly body/tent and have no body,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because we do not wish to be unclothed:</strong> The metaphor of the body being like clothing continues from the previous verses. This phrase refers to the process of removing the earthly body. Paul was saying that it is not (negatively) that he wants to leave this life, but that (positively) he wants to enter into the heavenly life. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it is not that we want to get rid of our earthly body, but that we want to have the heavenly one put on over us (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not that we want to be stripped of our covering (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because we do not want to have the old body stripped off (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>For we do not want to be left without any covering</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate the metaphor in a similar way as you did in the previous verses. For example:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate literally. Another example is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for we do not desire to be unclothed</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate it as a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because we do not want to be like someone <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who is</span> naked</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because we do not want to be unclothed, namely without a body</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because we do not want to die and be without that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">earthly</span> body like a naked person</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because we do not want to be without that body</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because we do not want to die and be without that body</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to be unclothed:</strong> This clause is passive. Death will cause the person to leave the body. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">for death</span> to unclothe us</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>|<span data-bnType=\"implied\">to die and</span> leave the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">earthly</span> tent</p></blockquote><h4>5:4d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:4d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but clothed,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but to be clothed with our heavenly building,</p></li><li><p>but <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we want</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to give to us</span> our heavenly bodies <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like putting</span> clothing <span data-bnType=\"implied\">on us</span>,</p></li><li><p>but <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we wish</span> to receive that eternal life with its heavenly body.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but clothed:</strong> The words “we wish to be” are implied here from 5:4c. In some languages it is more natural to include the implied words. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we wish</span> to be clothed…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>clothed:</strong> These words continue the metaphor from the previous verses. Translate this in the same way as you translated it in 5:2. In some languages it is necessary to say with what Paul wanted to be <em>clothed</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but to be clothed instead <u>with our heavenly dwelling</u> (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but we do want to put on <u>the eternal house</u> (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek does not have a word or phrase describing with what Paul wanted to be <em>clothed</em>, and many English versions do not have one either. However, it is clearly implied from 5:2b, and so a descriptive word or phrase can be supplied. Express the meaning in a way that is natural in your language.</p><h4>5:4e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:4e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that our mortality may be swallowed up by life.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that these bodies that will die will be swallowed by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">eternal</span> life.</p></li><li><p>in order that life will fill the new existence completely and the mortal life will be gone.</p></li><li><p>Then this body that dies will be fully covered with life.

Another way to translate this phrase is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in order that</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>our mortality may be swallowed up by life:</strong> The metaphor of <em>swallowed up</em> refers to eternal <em>life</em> completely replacing the <em>mortality</em> or condition of earthly life. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>this mortal being/existence will be swallowed by life</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>what is mortal will be transformed by life (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">eternal</span> life may/will swallow this mortal being/existence</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will transform what is mortal into what has <span data-bnType=\"implied\">eternal</span> life</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages translating the metaphor literally is not natural. The GNT example and the last example above translate the meaning of the metaphor. Other ways to translate this metaphor are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>our mortality may be absorbed into life immortal (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>this body that dies will be fully covered with life (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>this mortal life will be completely taken over by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">eternal</span> life <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as if swallowed up</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>life will fill the new existence completely and the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">earthly</span> mortal life is gone</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>our mortality:</strong> This phrase indicates that the earthly bodies will die. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>these bodies that will die (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the body which is subject to death</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>life:</strong> Here this word refers to <u>eternal</u> life.

He used the metaphor of a tent to refer to the earthly body and the metaphor of a building in heaven to refer to the heavenly body.

He explained that God had given that desire and that God had also given the Holy Spirit so we can be assured that the promise of a heavenly body will be fulfilled (5:5).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Then Paul wrote that they were confident in their faith (5:6–8) and purposely chose to please God (5:9). He wrote the reason to do so, namely that all believers will be judged and rewarded by God for the things they have done (5:10).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul continued to use the pronoun “we” to refer to himself, Timothy, and others who traveled with him telling the good news about Jesus.

If that is true in your language, translate that clause in a way that tells more about God. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here or translate it as an independent clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Now it is God who has made us for this very purpose. He has given us the Spirit as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Now the one having prepared us for this very thing is God.

This phrase implies that God gave. In some languages it is more natural to repeat the implied word here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has given to us</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Spirit as a pledge of what is to come:</strong> The Greek phrase is literally “the first payment of the Spirit.” Here the word <em>Spirit</em> refers to the Holy Spirit. In this metaphor of paying a large amount, this “first payment” is a pledge to pay the rest. The Holy Spirit is that “first payment” or <em>pledge</em>. The rest of the payment is the heavenly body, living in heaven with God, and other rewards. God has promised all these things to believers. But believers receive the Holy Spirit while on earth as a pledge for the rest. Other ways to translate this Greek phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Spirit as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Spirit as a down payment (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Rather than translate “first payment” literally, in some languages it is more natural to explain the meaning in some way.

He also said that God knew and approved of what they did (5:11c). He wrote that their accomplishments should cause the believers in Corinth to be proud of them (5:12). The basis for 5:13 may be that the false teachers had accused Paul of being crazy. Sometimes obeying God requires doing things which do not make sense to people who do not know God. Paul also explained the basis for his ministry (5:14–15).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">He explained the new way believers should think of each other (5:16–17). He explained the basis for that new way of thinking (5:18–19). He told them that apostles are like ambassadors for Christ, and he urged people to be reconciled to God (5:20). He explained the basis for believers becoming righteous (5:21). He urged believers to follow God completely (6:1–2).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Ministry of Reconciliation (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul explained the basis for his ministry</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Friendship with God through Christ (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God wants all people to reconcile with him</p></blockquote></div><h4>5:11a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Therefore, since we know what it means to fear the Lord, we try to persuade men:</strong> The first part, <em>we know what it means to fear the Lord</em>, is the basis or reason for persuading people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We know what it means to fear the Lord, <u>and so</u> we try to persuade others (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>men:</strong> Here the word <em>men</em> is general and refers to both men and women.

But if a literal translation would imply interpretation (2), you should translate according to interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages must say what Paul was trying to persuade the people to believe.

In English, such a connection is often indicated with a new sentence with no conjunction. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God himself knows… (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>What we are is clear to God:</strong> This clause indicates that God knew all things about Paul and the other evangelists. There was nothing about them that was hidden from God.

But he was perhaps a bit worried that the false teachers would deceive them into thinking that he was not a true apostle. So he hoped it was plain to them. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I hope that we are also well known to your consciences (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I hope that in your hearts you truly know us as well</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I expect that you see us for what we are in your consciences</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>conscience:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>conscience</em> refers to the memories of past deeds. Paul expected the believers to use their <em>conscience</em> and honestly evaluate his life and ministry and decide he had done nothing wrong.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>an opportunity (GW) <em>(BSB, NIV, NJB, NRSV, NABRE, NASB, GW, REB, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>This word refers to <u>the cause or reason for something</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a good reason (GNT) <em>(RSV, GNT, NLT, NCV, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because that is the usual meaning of the Greek word.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Louw and Nida say it means “favorable circumstances, opportunity, occasion.” Thrall (p. 400) translates it as “opportunity.” Hughes (on TW), Martin (p. 124), Barrett (p. 161), and Kistemaker (p. 184) translate it as “occasion.” Harris (p. 411) translates the Greek word as “cause” but in his prose he refers to it as “an opportunity” (p. 413).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>be proud of us:</strong> This phrase refers to becoming satisfied and happy with the accomplishments of Paul and the other evangelists with him. The believers at Corinth should have been proud of them because they had done great things for God and they had done them in a godly way. This is similar to a father being proud of his child when that child does something good. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>take pride in us (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>speak highly of us</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>honor us to/before others</p></blockquote><h4>5:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that you can answer those who take pride in appearances</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>in order that you can respond well to those who are proud of outward appearances/actions</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Be proud of us</span> so that you will know what to say to those who are so proud of external things.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those who take pride in appearances:</strong> The phrase <em>in appearances</em> refers to outward appearance. Here the phrase probably refers to the letters of commendation that the false teachers had, their persuasive way of speaking, and their dressing and acting like very religious people. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those who are proud about things that can be seen (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those who take pride in what is seen (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those who are so proud of the outward…qualification (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those whose pride is all in outward show (REB)</p></blockquote><h4>5:12d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:12d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>rather than in the heart.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>instead of their character.</p></li><li><p>Those people have no reason to be proud of their motives, thoughts, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and desires</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the heart:</strong> This phrase refers to a person’s motives, thoughts, desires, and character.

Thrall (p. 401) translates the text as “God, in Christ, was reconciling….” Barrett (p. 162) translates it as “God who in Christ was reconciling….”</span></span> The theme of this verse is not about the relationship of God to Jesus while he lived on earth.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>was reconciling:</strong> The verb tense here indicates that <em>reconciling</em> was a past event that extended over a period of time. God reconciled the world to himself <u>by means of what Jesus Christ did</u>. This would include incarnation (John 1:14, Luke 1:28–35), ministry, death, and resurrection.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the world:</strong> Here the word <em>world</em> refers to all people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all human beings (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>5:19b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:19b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>not counting men’s trespasses against them.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">for example,</span> he will not accuse them of their sins,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">When people become reconciled with God</span> he will not hold their sins against them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">5:19b <u>explains</u> something about the reconciliation in 5:19a. Indicate that in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>that is</u>, he will not count their sins against them</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not counting men’s trespasses against them:</strong> God keeps a record of everyone’s deeds (5:10). But these words indicate that:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>God is patient with all people while they live on earth;</p></li><li><p>he will not hold those sins against them when they appear before him on the day of judgment if they believed in Jesus before they died.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate these words are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not holding people’s sins against them</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not charging people with their sins</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>saying that he will not count their sins for the purpose of punishing them</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>men’s:</strong> In the Greek, the word that the BSB translates <em>men’s</em> is the pronoun “their.” This pronoun refers back to the word “world” in 5:19a. Here the pronoun refers generally to people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>anyone’s (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>trespasses:</strong> This word refers to deeds and thoughts that are against God and his character.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:19b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Other Scriptures indicate that people must accept Jesus as Savior before they die. Doing so, they are reconciled with God, and he does not count their sins against them on the day of judgment (Romans 4:3–8, John 3:15).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages a literal translation of 5:19b would wrongly indicate that God will forgive all people. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain the implied information in your translation.

The attitude of patience is included in the meaning. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>perseverance</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>patience to continue</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this Greek word in 1:6 (“patient endurance”).</p><h4>6:4c–5b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in troubles, hardships, and calamities; in beatings, imprisonments, and riots; in labor, sleepless nights, and hunger:</strong> This list is probably three groups of three items:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><em>troubles, hardships, and calamities</em></p></li><li><p><em>beatings, imprisonments, and riots</em></p></li><li><p><em>labor, sleepless nights, and hunger</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Within each group, the items are similar in some way to each other. The BSB indicates the three groups by using <em>and</em> only once within each group and separating the groups with semi-colons (;). If possible, indicate in your translation that these items are in three groups. But clearly indicating that all these items connect to “great endurance” is more important for the correct meaning of these verses.</p><h4>6:4c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:4c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in troubles, hardships, and calamities;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>in the midst of difficulties, disasters, terrible situations/circumstances;</p></li><li><p>bad times, hard times, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">unavoidable</span> disasters;</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in:</strong> Here the word <em>in</em> indicates that the list in 6:4c–5b describes various situations that Paul and the others experienced. They practiced great endurance <u>during</u> those situations. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in the midst of</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>during</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In the Greek, the word <em>in</em> occurs with each of the nine items. The BSB translates it three times, corresponding to the three groups of items. Other versions, such as the RSV, translate it only once, at the beginning of the list.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>troubles, hardships, and calamities:</strong> These three words refer to difficult situations of various kinds. Since God rules all things, you should <u>not</u> use words such as “misfortune” or “bad luck.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>troubles:</strong> This word probably refers to persecution and physical dangers. Paul describes some of his <em>troubles</em> in 1:8–10 and 11:23–27. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>afflictions (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>adversity</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 1:4 (where the BSB says “troubles”) or 4:17 (where the BSB says “affliction”). But you should use a word that is different from “hardships” and “distresses.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>hardships:</strong> This word refers to very difficult circumstances/situations. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>disasters (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>difficulties (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>calamities:</strong> This refers to very bad situations or circumstances that overwhelm the people in them. The people have no way to escape from those situations. They must endure through them. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>distresses (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>very hard times</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>terrible situations/circumstances</p></blockquote>",

In this context the message is the gospel of Jesus Christ. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>our message of truth (GNT) <em>(GNT, NLT, NET, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p><u>Translate literally</u>.

He has in his translation “declaring the truth.” Thrall translates the text as “the declaration of the truth” (p. 450). Martin translates it as “the message of truth” (p. 160).</span></span> But if a literal translation as in option (2) would allow or imply interpretation (1), you may want to follow that.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate this phrase according to interpretation (1) are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We faithfully preach the truth (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>declaring the truth (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the power of God:</strong> This phrase refers to the power that God gives to do things for him. This would include telling the gospel in a new place in a way that people would clearly understand, teaching well, and doing miracles and speaking prophecy. God demonstrated his power through Paul and the other evangelists. These deeds of God’s power commended Paul and the others to the believers in Corinth.

They used these weapons properly, and that showed that people should accept them. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>by (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>through</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>by means of</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left:</strong> This phrase is a metaphor. The <em>weapons</em> are the things that believers use while serving God and that God gives to them. These <em>weapons</em> are things such as faith, love, truth, prophecy, knowledge, and Scripture.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">These <em>weapons</em> both protect us and enable us to advance the kingdom of God. For example, just as soldiers use swords to attack and gain ground, Paul and the other evangelists with him told the truth about Jesus, and, as a result, people believed, and so God’s kingdom grew larger. Just as soldiers use shields when people attack them, Paul and the others relied on Scripture to defend themselves. A soldier usually carried his sword in his right hand and his shield in his left. Paul spoke generally of <em>weapons</em> to indicate all the various ways in which they caused God’s kingdom to grow larger or to defended themselves in their faith.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer only to actual weapons. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate the phrase as a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>ways of righteousness that are like weapons for the right hand and the left <span data-bnType=\"implied\">hand</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>ways of righteousness that advance the kingdom of God and ways <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of righteousness</span> that defend us</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate literally and explain the meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This phrase is a metaphor. The term “weapons” refers to things that believers use while serving God, such as faith, love, truth, prophecy, knowledge, and Scripture.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the weapons of righteousness:</strong> The word <em>of</em> indicates that the weapons are connected to the idea of righteousness. God, who enables people to be righteous, also supplies weapons for believers to use.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Furnish says that the “weapons of righteousness” are another sign that Paul and his co-workers “have been fully equipped by God to do battle for the gospel in the world” (p. 357).</span></span> When a believer uses these weapons, he is acting righteously. Examples are probably prayer, prophecy, doing miracles, and God’s word. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>weapons of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> righteousness</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">our</span> righteous <span data-bnType=\"implied\">deeds are like</span> weapons</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">fighters have</span> weapons, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and in the same way, God empowers us to</span> do righteous deeds</p></blockquote>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As God has said <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Scripture</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As God said <span data-bnType=\"implied\">long ago</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in his word</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause indicates that the quote explains 6:16b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>That is what God meant when he said</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God indicated that when he said</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will dwell with them:</strong> This clause probably indicates that God will live in the midst of his people. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will live…among them (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I and they will live together</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>walk among them:</strong> This clause indicates that God will have a close relationship with his people and help them. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>move among them (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>live among them (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>will accompany them</p></blockquote><h4>6:16d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:16d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and I will be their God, and they will be My people.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I am the God that they will serve and I will make them my people.”</p></li><li><p>and I will be <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like a father</span> to them, and I will acknowledge that they belong to me.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will be their God:</strong> Here the pronoun <em>their</em> indicates that God will have a relationship with his people.

He urged them to love him completely (6:13).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Then he urged them to avoid partnerships with unbelievers (6:14a) and used five rhetorical questions (6:14b–16a) to support this exhortation. He also supported this exhortation with quotes from the Old Testament (6:16b–18). On the basis of these quotes, he then urged them to live pure lives (7:1).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">He again urged them to love him (7:2a) and explained that he had not wronged anyone (7:2b). He explained that his love was complete (7:3) and he was very confident in them and very happy for them (7:4).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Open your hearts to us, and live holy lives</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Love us as we love you and live pure lives</p></blockquote></div><h4>6:17a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Therefore come out from among them and be separate, says the Lord. Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you:</strong> This quote uses parts of Isaiah 52:11 and Ezekiel 20:34, 41. If you footnote the locations of quotes from the Old Testament, you may want to do so here.</p><h4>6:17a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:17a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Therefore come out from among them and be separate, says the Lord.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Therefore the Lord said <span data-bnType=\"implied\">long ago</span>, “Leave<sup>(plur)</sup> them and be separate.</p></li><li><p>So the Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> says <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to us</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">through/in the Scriptures</span>, “Leave them and be separate from them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Therefore come out from among them and be separate, says the Lord:</strong> God says this to his people, not to everyone. Moreover, these words are also from the Old Testament. If people think that the saying here refers to all people, you may want to explain in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Therefore come out from them and be separate, says the Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to his people</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Scripture</span>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Therefore come out from them and be separate, says the Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to us</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in his holy word</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>come out from among them and be separate:</strong> In the Old Testament context, these commands were to separate physically from nations that practiced idolatry. Here Paul uses these clauses to command the believers in Corinth to follow ways that honor God. Believers are to avoid practices that lead to following idols. The two commands emphasize the meaning. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>come out from them, and be separate from them (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Leave those people, and be separate (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">These words are used as a metaphor. It refers to following God only and not following the ways of people of the world. (John 17:15–18 shows that this verse must be understood as a metaphor.) In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer only to physically leaving. If that is true in your language, explain in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This verse refers to following God only and not following the ways of people of the world. This verse does not refer to physical separation.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>says the Lord:</strong> Paul has actually added this clause to indicate that God is the speaker. It is not found in the material that he is quoting. The BSB follows the Greek order by placing the clause <em>says the Lord</em> in the middle of what God said. But to show that it is not part of the original quote, you may want to put it at the beginning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And so the Lord says, “You must leave them and separate yourselves from them. Have nothing to do with what is unclean, and I will accept you.” (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Place this clause where it is most natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Also, following the Greek word order literally, the BSB places the verb <em>says</em> before the phrase <em>the Lord</em>. This is acceptable but alternate English style. Other versions follow more common English word order. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Lord says (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the Lord:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Lord</em> means “the one in authority over (something)” or “master.” The word <em>Lord</em> refers to God here. In some languages it is more natural to include “God” in this phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span></p></blockquote><h4>6:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Touch no <span data-bnType=\"implied\">religiously</span> unclean thing, and I will welcome you.”</p></li><li><p>Avoid all things that I have prohibited, and I will bring you in.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Touch no unclean thing:</strong> In the Old Testament context of this quote, <em>unclean thing</em> probably referred mainly to idols and the practices of worshiping them.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In other places in the Old Testament, the phrase “unclean thing” usually referred to anything improper to use or touch in regard to religious purity. Such things included touching taboo food or animals or being involved with evil spirits or immoral practices.</span></span> The Jews were to worship God only. In the context of this letter, Paul used this saying to command believers to avoid wickedness, anything associated with Satan, idol worship, and anything that might cause a believer to follow such practices. In some languages a literal translation would have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This saying refers to avoiding idols and idol worship as well as other types of wickedness.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Touch no:</strong> Here the phrase <em>Touch no</em> refers figuratively to avoiding something. God wants his people to avoid such things as idols and idol worship. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Have nothing to do with (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>unclean thing:</strong> In the Old Testament, if someone touched something <em>unclean</em>, God prohibited that person from going to the temple and worshiping him for a period of time. God indicated that a dead body was <em>unclean</em>, and people with certain skin diseases or sores were <em>unclean</em>. God indicated that other things were also <em>unclean</em>. The word <em>unclean</em> does <u>not</u> refer to having dirt on you and needing to wash.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages the word <em>unclean</em> only means “having dirt on the skin.” If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Translate in a way that indicates the correct meaning of the word here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>thing that causes a person to become religiously corrupt/unacceptable</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>thing that I have prohibited</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate literally and explain the meaning in a footnote.

Similarly, idols and idol worship are unclean, because God has prohibited believers from following them. The word unclean does not refer to having dirt on you and needing to wash.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will receive you:</strong> The Greek word here translated <em>receive</em> means “show hospitality” or “welcome.” God will accept into his presence the people who avoided idol worship.

In Greek the term of address is literally at the end of this clause, and some English versions translate it that way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Since we have these promises, beloved (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to have the term of address first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>Dear friends</u>, since we have these promises</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Therefore…since we have these promises:</strong> The Greek words are literally “Therefore, having these promises” (as in the NASB). The conjunction <em>Therefore</em> indicates that the exhortation of 7:1b–c is based on the promises in Scripture that Paul quoted in 6:16c–18. The phrase <em>since we have these promises</em> reminds the reader of what Paul just said and prepares him for the exhortation in 7:1b–c.

It is not possible to emphasize this word in English in the same way. If possible, emphasize this word in your language. Here is one way that you may be able to emphasize this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>These are the promises we have, beloved, so let us…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase refers to the promises in 6:16–18. Clearly refer to them here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those promises</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>beloved:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>beloved</em> refers to people who are loved. Paul loved the believers in Corinth, so he addressed them with this Greek word.

The believer makes himself more holy by following God’s holy ways. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>make holiness perfect (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>holiness:</strong> This word refers to living without doing evil or sinning.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>by</u> living in awe of God (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the fear of God:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>fear</em> is sometimes translated as “reverence” (as in the NIV). Here the Greek word means to “respect” or “revere.” People who fear God are humble before God and are in awe of him. They also realize he is all-powerful and does as he chooses. So they respect and honor him. In some languages the word <em>fear</em> only means “be afraid of.” If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Include the meaning of “respect” or “venerate.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>fear <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and respect/revere</span> God</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning of <em>fear</em> as “respect” or “venerate.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>honor God</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word (<em>fear</em>) in 5:11.</p>",

Earlier he had sent Titus to Corinth because he wanted to know what the believers there were doing and whether they still accepted him. Paul had then gone to Macedonia, a northern province of Greece (7:5). He had met Titus there (7:6), and Titus had reported that the believers still accepted Paul and loved him (7:7a–d).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Then, in 7:8–9, Paul wrote that he was happy because the believers had responded properly to his earlier stern letter (also mentioned in 2:1–4; see also the section on “Paul’s letters to the Corinthians” in the introduction to these Notes). Paul explained the proper results of repentance (7:10–11). Lastly, Paul told them the reason for writing that letter (7:12–13a).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Then Paul told them that he was both encouraged and happy that they had responded properly to Titus (7:13b–16).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s Joy (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s joy at the repentance of the Corinthians</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Titus’ news comforts Paul and makes him happy</p></blockquote></div><h4>7:5a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:5a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For when we arrived in Macedonia,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ For when we<sup>(excl)</sup> entered Macedonia,</p></li><li><p>¶ Because, after we arrived here in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the province of</span> Macedonia,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> This conjunction introduces an explanation of why Paul had great joy in the midst of troubles (7:4c–d).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>when we arrived in Macedonia:</strong> Paul and the other evangelists left Troas (2:12) and traveled to Macedonia (2:13). They stayed in one of the cities in that province.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Macedonia:</strong> This name refers to a Roman province that today would include the northern part of the country of Greece and the land a bit farther north. But if you explained that the name <em>Macedonia</em> refers to a province in 1:16a or 2:13b, you probably do not need to explain that again here.</p><h4>7:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>our bodies had no rest,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>our bodies had no time free of troubles,</p></li><li><p>we, in our being, had no peace.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>our bodies:</strong> This phrase probably refers to the whole being, not only to the physical body. Bodies are vulnerable to many diseases and injury, but here Paul probably implied worrying and not trusting God completely. The worrying showed itself in physical restlessness and anxiety. The other evangelists with Paul were also restless and anxious. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>this body of ours (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>our beings</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to use the pronoun “we” and allow the context to imply the whole person. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we (NIV11)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>had no rest:</strong> Here the word <em>rest</em> refers to time free from troubles, conflicts, and worries (7:5c–d). It does not refer to time free from work. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>found no relief (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>had no peace</p></blockquote><h4>7:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but we were pressed from every direction—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but we experienced all kinds of troubles/oppression:</p></li><li><p>Indeed we underwent/experienced difficulties/hardships in all kinds of ways,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we were pressed:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>were pressed</em> refers to both trouble that occurs and the suffering a person experiences from that trouble. The Greek word includes people oppressing Paul and the others, but it also refers to any kind of difficulty or hardship. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>experience trouble/oppression</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>undergo hardships/suffering</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You may want to translate this Greek word as you did in 1:6 (where the BSB says “are afflicted”) or 4:8 (where the BSB says “are hard pressed”).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>from every direction:</strong> The Greek words are literally “in every way” (as in the NRSV). The BSB uses an English idiom to indicate that meaning here. Translate the meaning of “in every way.” Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>all kinds of (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in a number of ways (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>7:5d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:5d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>conflicts on the outside, fears within.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">enemies caused</span> conflicts from the outside, and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we had</span> fears on the inside.</p></li><li><p>namely, people opposing us, and the fears that we had.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">7:5d describes the two kinds of being harassed (7:5c).

People opposed Paul in Macedonia in Acts 16–17, and probably many of those same people opposed him again on this visit. Such conflicts were external to Paul. But within his mind he may have been fearful of the believers in Corinth rejecting him or Titus, and he may possibly have had other fears.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would not indicate the correct implied meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to add the implied meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>conflicts on the outside <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the body</span>, fears within <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the body</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>conflicts on the outside <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the/our inner person</span>, fears within <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the/our inner person</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>quarrels with others, fears in our hearts (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>conflicts:</strong> This word refers to people quarreling or confronting someone because they oppose him. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>disputes (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We were troubled by enemies (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>struggles (NET)</p></blockquote>",

Earlier he had sent Titus to Corinth because he wanted to know what the believers there were doing and whether they still accepted him. Paul had then gone to Macedonia, a northern province of Greece (7:5). He had met Titus there (7:6), and Titus had reported that the believers still accepted Paul and loved him (7:7a–d).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Then, in 7:8–9, Paul wrote that he was happy because the believers had responded properly to his earlier stern letter (also mentioned in 2:1–4; see also the section on “Paul’s letters to the Corinthians” in the introduction to these Notes). Paul explained the proper results of repentance (7:10–11). Lastly, Paul told them the reason for writing that letter (7:12–13a).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Then Paul told them that he was both encouraged and happy that they had responded properly to Titus (7:13b–16).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s Joy (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s joy at the repentance of the Corinthians</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Titus’ news comforts Paul and makes him happy</p></blockquote></div><h4>7:6a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:6a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But God, who comforts the downcast,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But God, who encourages people when they are discouraged,</p></li><li><p>But God comforts those who are downhearted/depressed,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But God, who comforts the downcast:</strong> The clause <em>who comforts the downcast</em> tells the reader more about God. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that Paul was thinking of other gods and only this one <em>comforts the downcast</em>. If that is true in your language, translate this clause so that it tells more about God. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But God comforts the downcast. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">And</span> he</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>comforts:</strong> This word refers to easing sadness or discouragement so that a person is less sad or discouraged. The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>comforts</em> also means “encourages.” God comforted Paul in each of his distresses and troubles and encouraged him to be strong in faith. See how you translated this word in 1:4 or 2:7.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the downcast:</strong> This phrase refers to people who are discouraged in some way. It probably implies God’s people rather than all people, given the similar wording in Isaiah 49:13. But you should refer generally to people here. Other ways to translate it are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who are discouraged (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>downcast people</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>downcast:</strong> This word refers to being discouraged. A downcast person is tired in his spirit about all the bad things that have happened. He may not expect things to get better. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>downhearted (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>depressed (NASB)</p></blockquote><h4>7:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>comforted us by the arrival of Titus,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>encouraged us<sup>(excl)</sup> by means of Titus coming <span data-bnType=\"implied\">back to us</span>,</p></li><li><p>and comforted us with Titus’ return <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to us</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>comforted us by the arrival of Titus:</strong> Titus arrived safely from Corinth with good news about the believers there.

He was very happy with how the believers had responded to his letter (7:8–13a). Some ways to translate this conjunction are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So now (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Because</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is more natural to allow the context to indicate the connection and omit the conjunction, as the BSB and several other English versions do.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Even if I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it:</strong> Paul knew he should write the letter. If the letter caused sorrow, that was also as it should be. The word <em>if</em> is used rhetorically to cause the believers in Corinth to think about that sorrow. The word <em>if</em> does <u>not</u> indicate that Paul doubted that he had caused them sorrow. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>though I did distress you with my letter, I do not regret it (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>though I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>even if/though you were saddened because of that letter to you, I <span data-bnType=\"implied\">now</span> have no regret that I wrote it</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>caused you sorrow:</strong> What Paul wrote in the letter made the believers sad. In it, Paul probably rebuked them for not doing the right thing. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>made you sad (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>grieved you (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>my letter:</strong> Scholars sometimes refer to this letter as “the severe letter” because of the description of its results in this verse. (This letter is probably not 1 Corinthians; see the section on “Paul’s letters to the Corinthians” in the introduction to these Notes).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>regret:</strong> The word <em>regret</em> refers to someone wishing they had acted differently than they had done. Earlier, Paul had changed his mind and wished he had not sent the letter. He feared a bad result, but now he was glad he had sent the letter.</p><h4>7:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Although I did regret it,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For some time I was sorry that I had written it,</p></li><li><p>I was regretting <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for a while</span> that I sent it.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Although I did regret it:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek clause:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Paul <u>regretted</u> in the past. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>though I was sorry at first (NLT) <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, NASB, NLT, GW, CEV, NET, REB, NCV, ESV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Paul <u>did not regret</u> in the past. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I could have been sorry (GNT) <em>(GNT, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Martin says, “this regret is now a thing of the past, for when Paul wrote 2 Corinthians he had already heard the good report from Titus of the Corinthians’ change of heart” (p. 228). Thrall (p. 486), Kistemaker (p. 251), Barrett (p. 210), Furnish (p. 384), Hughes (on TW), and Harris (p. 532) support interpretation (1) in their translations.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I did regret it:</strong> The Greek words indicate that Paul had regretted for some time in the past. Perhaps soon after he sent the letter, Paul regretted sending it. But Titus arrived with good news about the believers dealing properly with what Paul had said in the letter. So Paul no longer regretted sending it. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I did regret it <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for some time</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I was regretting it</p></blockquote><h4>7:8c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:8c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I now see that my letter caused you sorrow, but only for a short time.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>for I know it was painful to you for a little while.

Here is another way to translate this verb in both places:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>made you sad (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but only for a short time:</strong> These words indicate that the sorrow or hurt lasted only a little while. These words do not refer to how long Paul’s regret lasted.</p>",

Earlier he had sent Titus to Corinth because he wanted to know what the believers there were doing and whether they still accepted him. Paul had then gone to Macedonia, a northern province of Greece (7:5). He had met Titus there (7:6), and Titus had reported that the believers still accepted Paul and loved him (7:7a–d).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Then, in 7:8–9, Paul wrote that he was happy because the believers had responded properly to his earlier stern letter (also mentioned in 2:1–4; see also the section on “Paul’s letters to the Corinthians” in the introduction to these Notes). Paul explained the proper results of repentance (7:10–11). Lastly, Paul told them the reason for writing that letter (7:12–13a).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Then Paul told them that he was both encouraged and happy that they had responded properly to Titus (7:13b–16).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s Joy (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s joy at the repentance of the Corinthians</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Titus’ news comforts Paul and makes him happy</p></blockquote></div><h4>7:10a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>repentance that leads to salvation without regret:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>without regret</em> probably connects to the word <em>repentance</em>. Repentance has two results: <em>salvation</em> and no <em>regret</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>repentance that leads to salvation and <u>that</u> leaves no regret</p></blockquote><h4>7:10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Godly sorrow brings repentance</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For sorrow according to what God wants causes people to repent,</p></li><li><p>For example, when a person grieves in a godly way, he changes his thinking <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and follows God</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">7:10a begins with a Greek conjunction that is often translated as “for” or “because.” In this context it introduces an explanation of the kind of sorrow that leads to repentance (7:9c). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In fact, (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is more natural to allow the context to indicate the connection and omit the conjunction, as the BSB and some other English versions do.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Godly sorrow:</strong> The Greek words are literally “sorrow according to God.” The Greek phrase is similar in meaning to the Greek phrase “you became sorrowful according to God” in 7:9d. This kind of sorrow occurs according to what God would want believers to be sad about. Translate this phrase in a similar way to the phrase in 7:9d. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>sadness in the way God wants</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>godly grief (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the kind of sorrow God wants us to experience (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>brings repentance:</strong> Here the verb <em>brings</em> refers to causing something. If a person has sorrow over his own sin, then he should repent of that sin. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>produces a repentance (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>leads to repentance (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>repentance:</strong> Here the word <em>repentance</em> probably refers to turning from all sin, because this <em>repentance</em> leads to salvation (7:10b). Translate in a way that allows this meaning.</p><h4>7:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that leads to salvation without regret,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and that results in salvation and there is no regret <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in it</span>.</p></li><li><p>so that God rescues/saves him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from eternal death</span>. And no one is ever sad/sorry about those results.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that leads to salvation:</strong> This phrase indicates that the result of this kind of repentance is <em>salvation</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>salvation:</strong> This word refers to rescuing or saving someone from something. God saves people from eternal death when they believe in Jesus. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>saving/freeing by God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God saving him/them</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>being saved from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">eternal</span> death</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 1:6.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>without regret:</strong> The Greek word here literally means “no regrets.” Repentance and salvation do not result in regrets. Other ways to translate this Greek word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and brings no regret (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>—and there is no regret in that (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you don’t have anything to feel bad about (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>7:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but worldly sorrow brings death.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But worldly <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people’s kind of</span> sorrow results in death.</p></li><li><p>But the grief of worldly people leads to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">eternal</span> death.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>worldly sorrow:</strong> This phrase refers to sorrow as unbelievers experience it. This kind of sorrow leads to hiding sin, making excuses, blaming others, and other things that do not lead to repentance. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>sadness that is merely human (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>worldly grief (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>sorrow of worldly people</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>brings death:</strong> If a person experiences worldly sorrow, he sins more to hide it, blames others, or does something else hurtful. He does not turn to God. God will judge him guilty because he did not repent. So in that way worldly sorrow <em>brings</em> God’s punishment, namely eternal <em>death</em> in hell.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation of the word <em>death</em> would wrongly refer only to physical death. If that is true in your language, you may want to include the implied information in your translation.

Repeating the word <em>what</em> continues the emphasis for each phrase.

Paul explained the proper results of repentance (7:10–11). Lastly, Paul told them the reason for writing that letter (7:12–13a).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Then Paul told them that he was both encouraged and happy that they had responded properly to Titus (7:13b–16).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s Joy (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s joy at the repentance of the Corinthians</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Titus’ news comforts Paul and makes him happy</p></blockquote></div><h4>7:13a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:13a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>On account of this, we are encouraged.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Therefore we<sup>(excl)</sup> are encouraged.</p></li><li><p>All those things encouraged us.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>On account of this, we are encouraged:</strong> The phrase <em>On account of this</em> refers to all that the believers did, as Paul mentioned in 7:6–12.

In some languages an active clause must be used. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>All this encouraged us</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>encouraged:</strong> This word refers to making someone feel confident and happy about something.

In some languages the word <em>spirit</em> is only used when the body has died. If that is true in your language, refer to the inner part of a person while the person is still alive. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>his insides/stomach</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In English, this is often translated as “heart.” See how you translated “heart” in 5:12.</p>",

So he was not <em>embarrassed</em> or shamed. Paul’s boasting is a fact.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages the word “if” can be used rhetorically here with the above meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to follow the literal Greek. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if I have been somewhat boastful about you to him, I was not disgraced (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if I have boasted to him about anything concerning you, I have not been embarrassed by you (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here the word “if” does <u>not</u> indicate possibility or doubt. In some languages, translating the word “if” will not indicate the correct meaning. If that is so, follow the BSB and other English versions that omit the word “if.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I did boast of you to him, and you have not disappointed me (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>whatever boasts I made to him about you, I was not put to shame (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I didn’t have to be ashamed of anything I had said to him when I bragged about you (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>7:14a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:14a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Indeed, I was not embarrassed</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I was not shamed.</p></li><li><p>And you did not shame/disappoint me.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Indeed:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>Indeed</em> is often translated as “for” or “because.” In this context it introduces another reason for Paul’s joy (7:13c). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to allow the context to indicate the connection and omit the conjunction.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>embarrassed:</strong> This word refers to feeling anxious and uncomfortable because of a difficulty that one was responsible for. Paul would have been embarrassed if the believers had not obeyed him, because he was their leader. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>made to look foolish (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>put to shame (RSV)</p></blockquote><h4>7:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>by anything I had boasted to him about you.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For if I have expressed to him some pride in you, (RSV)</p></li><li><p>Earlier I boasted of you<sup>(plur)</sup> to him,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I had boasted:</strong> This clause refers to the time before Titus left Paul and went to Corinth. Titus’ trip to Corinth and back probably lasted a month or more. Another example is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Earlier I boasted</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>boasted:</strong> This word refers to praising someone or saying how good someone is. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>speak <span data-bnType=\"implied\">very</span> highly about</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>praise</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>tell about how great/wonderful/good</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 1:12.</p><h4>7:14c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:14c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But just as everything we said to you was true,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>just as all the things that I told you were true,</p></li><li><p>Everything I said to you has been the truth.</p></li></ul></div><h4>7:14c–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting to Titus has proved to be true as well:</strong> These words compare the phrase <em>everything we said to you</em> and the phrase <em>our boasting to Titus</em>.

Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>our boasting about you to Titus has shown itself to be true</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your deeds have shown that our boasting about you to Titus was true</p></blockquote>",

Earlier he had sent Titus to Corinth because he wanted to know what the believers there were doing and whether they still accepted him. Paul had then gone to Macedonia, a northern province of Greece (7:5). He had met Titus there (7:6), and Titus had reported that the believers still accepted Paul and loved him (7:7a–d).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Then, in 7:8–9, Paul wrote that he was happy because the believers had responded properly to his earlier stern letter (also mentioned in 2:1–4; see also the section on “Paul’s letters to the Corinthians” in the introduction to these Notes). Paul explained the proper results of repentance (7:10–11). Lastly, Paul told them the reason for writing that letter (7:12–13a).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Then Paul told them that he was both encouraged and happy that they had responded properly to Titus (7:13b–16).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s Joy (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s joy at the repentance of the Corinthians</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Titus’ news comforts Paul and makes him happy</p></blockquote></div><h4>7:16</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:16\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I rejoice that I can have complete confidence in you.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I rejoice that I am certain that you<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will do the right/proper thing</span> in every matter.</p></li><li><p>I am very happy because I am confident in your deeds/behavior/faith in all things.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I rejoice that I can have complete confidence in you:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>complete</em> is literally “in everything” (as in the NASB). Paul was confident that the believers would do the right thing in any situation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I’m pleased that I can be confident about you in every way (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In this division, Paul encouraged the believers in Corinth to be generous when giving money for the poor believers in Jerusalem. He used the believers in Macedonia as an example of generous givers (8:1–15). He told the believers in Corinth that Titus and two other believers were coming there to get the gift ready to give. He reminded them of their earlier eagerness to give (8:16–9:5). He encouraged them again to complete this desire to give and to do so generously, as well as to give joyously (9:6–15).</p>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>How that (KJV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is more natural to allow the context to indicate the connection and omit the conjunction.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>In:</strong> This phrase indicates that their joy (8:2b) and generosity (8:2c) occurred <u>during</u> the most severe trial. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>throughout (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in the midst of</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>While (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the terrible ordeal they suffered:</strong> The Greek words are literally “a great test of affliction.” This phrase refers to a very difficult situation caused by “affliction.” It may have been people persecuting the believers in Macedonia.

If possible, use similar words in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the <u>abundance</u> of their joy and their deep poverty <u>abounded</u> unto the riches of their liberality (KJV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>their <u>overflowing</u> joy and their extreme poverty <u>overflowed</u> in rich generosity</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages repeating the meaning like this is not natural. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>their abundance of joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of generosity (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Moreover, some languages cannot use “overflow” in this figurative sense. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>their joy was so great that they were extremely generous in their giving, even though they are very poor (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they are very poor.

Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>favor (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to let (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>blessing (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Also see the note on “grace” in 8:1b.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>sharing:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>sharing</em> is usually translated “fellowship,” as in 6:14c. Here the Greek word refers to doing as other churches were doing. Other churches were helping the poor believers in Jerusalem, and the churches in Macedonia also wanted to help. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>taking part (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>participating with the other churches</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>this service:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>service</em> is usually translated “ministry,” as in 6:3b. Here the Greek word refers to helping the poor believers in Jerusalem. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>helping (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the support (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the gift (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>saints:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>saints</em> is literally “holy ones.” The word refers to all believers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s people (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 1:1.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here however, the word <em>saints</em> refers only to the believers in Jerusalem (1 Corinthians 16:3). Paul was collecting money to take to the believers there who were poor and needed help (Romans 15:25–26). In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer to believers in general. If that is true in your language, you may want to add the implied meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Jerusalem</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who are poor</span></p></blockquote>",

In this section, Paul spoke of the generous gift of money from the believers in Macedonia and their attitude in giving (2 Corinthians 8:1–5). Paul hoped that the believers in Corinth would follow that example of giving.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Then Paul told them that Titus was coming to them to help collect the money (8:6). Paul encouraged them to give generously just as they did other things well (8:7). He indicated that he wanted to see that they were sincere in their promise to help the poor with this gift (8:8). He further encouraged them by using the example of Jesus giving (8:9).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Then Paul advised them how best to collect the money for the gift (8:10–11). Then he explained that what matters is giving according to what each person has (8:12). The goal in giving is equality, not making oneself poor for the sake of others (8:13–15).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples for this section heading are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Encouragement to Be Generous (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A Call to Generous Giving (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Complete<sup>(plur)</sup> the collection for the poor believers <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Jerusalem</span></p></blockquote></div><h4>8:5a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:5a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And not only did they do as we expected,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And they gave differently than we<sup>(excl)</sup> expected,</p></li><li><p>We did not expect them to do this:</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And not only did they do as we expected:</strong> Paul was surprised by their dedication to God (8:5b) and to himself and the others (8:5c) in this matter. He probably also expected a smaller gift because they were so poor (8:2b). Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they did it differently than we expected</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they gave in a way we did not expect (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we did not expect them to do this</p></blockquote><h4>8:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but they gave themselves first to the Lord</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">namely,</span> they first decided to always do what the Lord wanted them to do,</p></li><li><p>they first <span data-bnType=\"implied\">completely</span> dedicated themselves to serve the Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but:</strong> There is contrast between what Paul expected them to do and what they did. 8:5a indicates that they did <u>not</u> do as Paul expected. So in some languages it is more natural to connect 8:5b to 8:5a without contrast. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>First they gave themselves to the Lord (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they gave themselves first to the Lord:</strong> This phrase refers to devoting themselves to God and to serving him. The believers decided to follow God with their whole being in preparation to give. This phrase does not refer to the first act of believing in Jesus to be saved. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it began by their offering themselves to the Lord (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they made a complete dedication of themselves first to the Lord (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>first they entrusted their lives to the Lord</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they first devoted their lives to doing the Lord’s will</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Lord:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Lord</em> means “the one in authority over (something)” or “master.” It refers to someone greater in status or power. The word <em>Lord</em> probably refers to Jesus here, because 8:5c has the word “God” rather than the word “he.” In some languages it is more natural to include the name “Jesus” here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>ruler <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 4:5 or 6:17.</p><h4>8:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and then to us, because it was the will of God.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and then <span data-bnType=\"implied\">followed</span> us as God wanted them to do.</p></li><li><p>Then/Next they dedicated themselves to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">following</span> us in God’s will.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and then to us:</strong> The words “they gave themselves” are implied but are not repeated here.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and then <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they gave themselves</span> to us</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">These words have a similar meaning to 8:5b. The believers decided to follow Paul as their leader in their faith.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because it was the will of God:</strong> This phrase refers to doing something according to what God would want them to do.

The theme changes from the recent history about collecting the money to Paul urging the believers in Corinth to finish collecting the money. The Greek conjunction probably does not indicate contrast here. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Furthermore/Next</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Indeed, (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>just as you excel:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>excel</em> refers to having or making an abundance or surplus of something. The believers in Corinth had great faith, knowledge, earnestness, and love, and their speech honored God. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>just as you abound (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as you do well</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The BSB translates the Greek word as “overflowed” in 8:2c. If possible, use a similar word or phrase here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in everything:</strong> The believers in Corinth were not perfect in their faith, but they did well in many areas. Paul exaggerated, using the word <em>everything</em> to encourage them to do well in giving as well (8:7d). Many English versions keep the exaggerating use of <em>everything</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in every good quality (JBP)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">But in some languages it is <u>not</u> natural to exaggerate here. If that is true in your language, translate in a way that shows that Paul was encouraging the believers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in so many ways (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>8:7b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness, and in the love we inspired in you:</strong> This list contains examples of how the believers “excel in everything” (8:7a). The BSB indicates the list with long dashes before and after the list. Other ways to indicate that the list contains examples are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You are so rich in all you have: in faith, speech, and knowledge, in your eagerness to help and in your love for us. And… (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">for example:</span> in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness, and in your love for us</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">including</span> in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness, and in your love for us</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in…in…in…in…in:</strong> The phrase “you excel” is implied before each occurrence of <em>in</em> but is not explicitly repeated. In some languages it is more natural to repeat some or all the words. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">you excel</span> in faith, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you excel</span> in speech, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you excel</span> in knowledge, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you excel</span> in complete earnestness and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you excel</span> in your love for us</p></blockquote><h4>8:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in faith, in speech, in knowledge,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">for example:</span> in believing <span data-bnType=\"implied\">well/strongly</span>, in speaking <span data-bnType=\"implied\">well</span>, in having <span data-bnType=\"implied\">full</span> knowledge,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">including that</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you exceed/surpass</span> in faith <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Jesus</span>, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you exceed/surpass</span> in speaking <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for Jesus</span>, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you exceed/surpass</span> in being able to understand <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s ways</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>faith:</strong> Here the word <em>faith</em> means “a strong and sincere belief in something or someone.” To have <em>faith</em> in a person means to trust someone, to rely on someone, to be committed to someone. Faith in Jesus refers to:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>accepting His message as true;</p></li><li><p>acting on the basis of His message;</p></li><li><p>being confident in His message;</p></li><li><p>trusting in Him.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Here the word may refer to having the faith to do great things such as miracles. Your language may have a noun, phrase, or idiom with that meaning. Some other examples for translating are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>believing <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Jesus</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>trusting <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and committed to Jesus</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 1:24 or 5:7.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>speech:</strong> Here the word <em>speech</em> probably refers to speaking well and in a way that is easily understood. Paul probably referred to speaking the truth about the gospel here. Proper use of the gifts of prophecy and tongues might also be included here. Many English versions use a general word regarding speaking and do not refer to a particular kind of speaking. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>speaking (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>eloquence (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you can express that faith in words (JBP)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>knowledge:</strong> Here the word <em>knowledge</em> probably refers to a good understanding of the gospel and the truths in it.

The believers excel in this love (8:7a). Here the love is probably <u>for Jesus</u>. Paul taught them about Jesus and now the believers love Jesus well.

An unnamed believer went along with Titus, and Paul described his standing in other churches (8:18–19b). Then Paul described how they intended to be careful regarding this gift (8:19c–21).

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>thank God! (NLT) <em>(BSB, RSV, NJB, NASB, NABRE, ESV, NLT, NET, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It indicates that <u>Paul and the other evangelists</u> (from 8:18) thank God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>How <u>we</u> thank God for making Titus as eager as <u>we</u> are to help you! (GNT) <em>(GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It indicates that <u>Paul</u> (from 8:10) thanks God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I thank God (GW) <em>(NIV, GW, CEV, REB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) because of the pronouns “our” in 8:13 and “we” in 8:18. But interpretation (2) is also possible from the general context.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who put into the heart of Titus:</strong> Here the word <em>heart</em> refers to the place where the emotions, will, and desire are. Your language may use another organ for that place or refer generally to a person. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who put into the liver/insides of Titus</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who gave to Titus</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the same devotion I have for you:</strong> The words <em>I have</em> are not in the Greek, but are implied from the word <em>same</em>. Paul used “I” in 8:10. But it is also possible that the words “we have” are implied from the word “us” in 8:6. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>eager as <u>we are</u> to help you (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>devotion:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>devotion</em> also refers to earnestness (7:11, 8:7–8). Here it refers to an earnest desire for good things to happen to someone. So the BSB translates the word as <em>devotion</em>. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>earnest care (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>eager to help (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sincere concern (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>enthusiasm (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>dedicated (GW)</p></blockquote>",

It is not known who this “brother” might be. The believers in Corinth probably knew him, so Paul did not name him. It is also possible that the reason why Paul did not name him was that he wanted to show that Titus was the leader of that group.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who is praised by all the churches for his work in the gospel:</strong> The Greek words are literally “whose praise/approval in the gospel (is) through(out) all the churches.” The churches knew of this person and approved of him regarding his faith and life.

The context implies that the believers were eager to collect money and send it to the poor believers in Jerusalem (9:1). So the BSB and some other English versions add implied information.

Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I brag about you (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I speak of it with pride (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek uses the present tense, “I boast.” Here the present tense indicates that Paul was boasting about the believers in Corinth during the time he was in Macedonia. He probably also boasted about them after he left Macedonia, even to the day he wrote this letter. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I keep boasting (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>boasting:</strong> This word refers to praising someone or saying how good someone is.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am sending the brothers</span> in order that you may be ready</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you will be prepared:</strong> The believers were to have their gift prepared when Paul arrived. The three men went ahead of Paul to make sure the gift would be ready. The gift was probably not ready when Titus and the other two men arrived, since they went to help prepare it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate or imply that the gift was ready for the three men. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you may be ready <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for me</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you may have <span data-bnType=\"implied\">your gift</span> ready <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when I arrive</span></p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 9:3b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is more natural to say what Paul wanted (9:3c) first,and what he did not want (9:3b) second. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>3a</sup>But I am sending the brothers in order that <sup>3c</sup>you may be prepared, as I said you would be, <sup>3b</sup>and that our boasting about you in this matter should not prove empty.</p></blockquote></div>",

He began with a proverb about planting few seeds as compared to planting many seeds (9:6). He told them that a person should decide for himself how much to give and that he should give because he wants to and not because someone is forcing him to give (9:7). He told them to give graciously because God would give graciously to them so that they would have all they needed (9:8). He supported what he said in 9:8 with a quote from the Old Testament (9:9). He used a metaphor of a farmer (9:10) to illustrate that God would provide for them. He told them that God would provide for them generously so they could give generously, which would cause those who received the gift to thank God very much (9:11).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Then Paul explained that the gift would help God’s people who were in need and would cause them to thank God (9:12–13), as well as to pray for the people who had given (9:14). Paul finished by thanking God for his gift of Jesus as Savior (9:15).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples for this section heading are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Blessings to be expected from the collection (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Cheerful Giver (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul encouraged them to give joyfully because they wanted to</p></blockquote></div><h4>9:6a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:6a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ So/And think about this <span data-bnType=\"implied\">saying</span>: If someone plants few seeds, he will harvest a little fruit/grain.</p></li><li><p>¶ Consider these words: The person who sows sparsely will also reap sparsely,</p></li></ul></div><h4>9:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And, if someone plants generously/much, he will also harvest generously/much.</p></li><li><p>and/but the person who sows in a way that blesses will also reap a blessing.</p></li></ul></div><h4>9:6a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Remember this:</strong> The Greek phrase can be translated as “And/But/Then this.” The conjunction connects this verse to 9:5 and introduces what Paul said next. The word <em>this</em> introduces the following proverb as his main point for the readers to think about here. The Greek phrase tells the reader to think about the meaning of what follows and how it applies to 9:5. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The point is this (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Consider these <span data-bnType=\"implied\">words</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So/And think about this <span data-bnType=\"implied\">saying</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Note this <span data-bnType=\"implied\">principle/proverb</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously:</strong> This proverb or saying indicates that if a person plants only a few plants, then he should only expect only a small harvest. Likewise, if he plants a lot, he can expect a lot. With this saying Paul encouraged the believers to give generously to the poor believers in Jerusalem so that God would bless them much.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages this saying does not clearly connect to 9:5. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Paul used this saying to encourage the believers to give generously.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sparingly:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>sparingly</em> refers to doing only a little of something. It is the opposite of “generous.” Here it indicates that a person only plants a few seeds when he could have planted much more. As a result, he will only see a small harvest. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>few</u> seeds…<u>small</u> crop (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sparsely (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>whoever sows generously will also reap generously:</strong> The Greek words are literally “the one sowing upon blessings will also reap upon blessings.” The Greek word translated <em>blessings</em> has a figurative meaning of “generous,” and that is the meaning here. Paul probably used the word “blessings” here to help connect this saying to the word “blessing” in 9:5c, where the BSB translates it as “bountiful gift” (see note there). Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>whoever sows in a way that blesses will also reap a blessing</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>whoever sows in the manner of generosity will also reap generously</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If possible, use the same word you used in 9:5c for “bountiful” to show the connection to that verse. However, in some languages it will be necessary to use a different word here for the proper meaning. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the person who sows plentifully/abundantly will also reap plentifully/abundantly</p></blockquote>",

He told them to give graciously because God would give graciously to them so that they would have all they needed (9:8). He supported what he said in 9:8 with a quote from the Old Testament (9:9).

He told them that God would provide for them generously so they could give generously, which would cause those who received the gift to thank God very much (9:11).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Then Paul explained that the gift would help God’s people who were in need and would cause them to thank God (9:12–13), as well as to pray for the people who had given (9:14).

Paul has been talking about believers giving generously. Here Paul began talking about God doing that. Another way to translate this conjunction is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Furthermore,</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to allow the context to indicate the connection and omit the conjunction.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He:</strong> In this verse, the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>He</em> refers to God. But “He” in 9:9 refers to someone else. In some languages the pronoun <em>He</em> here would not refer to God. If that is true in your language, you may want to indicate the proper meaning in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>seed to the sower and bread for food:</strong> These two phrases refer figuratively to all the needs of believers. The phrase <em>seed to the sower</em> probably refers to earthly wealth. Like the person who scatters in 9:9b, the <em>sower</em> scatters <em>seed</em>, which refers figuratively to sharing wealth with the needy. The phrase <em>bread for food</em> probably refers to daily needs.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages this saying would refer only to actual seed and bread. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The seed and bread in this verse refer figuratively to all the needs of believers. God provides for all the needs of believers and even more so that they can give to others.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sower:</strong> This word refers to the person who sows/plants seeds. At that time in that area, the usual way to do that was to scatter seed by throwing it over a cleared area.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The fact that the sower scatters seed is somewhat important because it connects to the saying in 9:9b. If the usual word for a person who plants seeds does not imply scattering the seed, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate the meaning “a person who sows/plants seeds” and explain its meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>At that time in that area, the usual way to plant seeds was to scatter seed by throwing it over a cleared area. This connects to the saying of scattering in 9:9b.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Explain its meaning in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">seed scattering</span> farmer <em>But the added implied information should not restrict God only to giving seed to this kind of farmer and not giving seed to other kinds of farmers. If your translation limits God in this way, you may want to use the footnote above instead.</em></p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>bread for food:</strong> The word <em>bread</em> refers generally to food. Bread was the daily food of the people at that time and place. It is also connected to the word “seed,” since wheat seed is used to make bread.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">You may want to use the general word for food or use a kind of food that is eaten daily and can refer figuratively to all kinds of food. But it would be good if it grows from a planted seed. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>food to eat</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>rice/corn/millet for food</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you use a word such as rice/corn/sago/millet, you may want to explain the literal word in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Literally: “bread.” Bread was the daily food of the people at that time and place.</p></blockquote><h4>9:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>will supply and multiply your store of seed</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>will also provide and expand your<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">supply of</span> seed</p></li><li><p>So like that, God will give to you seed and increase its amount</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will…multiply your store of seed:</strong> The Greek words are literally “will increase your seed.” Here the phrase refers to having more than what is needed for the time of sowing.

He told them to give graciously because God would give graciously to them so that they would have all they needed (9:8). He supported what he said in 9:8 with a quote from the Old Testament (9:9). He used a metaphor of a farmer (9:10) to illustrate that God would provide for them. He told them that God would provide for them generously so they could give generously, which would cause those who received the gift to thank God very much (9:11).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Then Paul explained that the gift would help God’s people who were in need and would cause them to thank God (9:12–13), as well as to pray for the people who had given (9:14).

The four most likely interpretations are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><u>People obey their confession</u>. Believers agree that the gospel is true and have publicly said so. They live in obedience to what they said about the gospel. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your obedience to your confession of the gospel of Christ (NASB) <em>(RSV, NABRE, NASB, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p><u>People obey in connection to confessing the gospel</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the obedience that <u>accompanies</u> your confession of the gospel (NIV) <em>(BSB, NIV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p><u>People obey the command to preach the gospel</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the obedience which you show in professing the gospel (NJB) <em>(NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p><u>People obey the gospel</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your loyalty to the gospel of Christ, which you profess (GNT) <em>(GNT, CEV, NCV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because the word “obedience” is most closely connected to the word <em>confession</em> in the Greek.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kistemaker (p. 320), Hodge (p. 226), and Hughes (on TW) follow interpretation (1).</span></span> Other ways to translate this following interpretation (1) are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>your obedience to your confession in the gospel (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you obey/follow your own words when you said that the gospel was true and that you would obey it</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>confession:</strong> Here the word <em>confession</em> refers to saying publicly that they believe the gospel about Jesus.

The first one is 9:13c.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>contribution:</strong> This word refers to giving some of what they had to others. The Greek word also implies a relationship included with that <em>contribution</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>fellowship (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>them:</strong> Here the pronoun <em>them</em> refers to the poor believers (“saints” in 9:12a).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and to all the others:</strong> These words probably refer to the willingness of the believers in Corinth to help any believer in need. The words do not indicate that the believers in Corinth had already shared with every other believer.

See how you translated it there.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>His indescribable gift:</strong> Here, the <em>gift</em> is probably Jesus and what he did for people. This would include salvation and righteousness. In some languages, a literal translation would wrongly indicate or imply a different meaning.

However, in these chapters he spoke in a somewhat more urgent or severe way. He told them that he had the authority of an apostle of Jesus and explained how that was true. He spoke about the false teachers who were trying to introduce Jewish practices into the practices of Christians. He explained how to evaluate their claims of authority and their teachings. And he warned them that he was ready to discipline anyone who was sinning.</p>",

He explained how a believer fights against those who oppose God (10:3–4) and how to rebuke them as well as correct a disobedient believer (10:5–6).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">He told them to understand their situation, including Paul’s authority (10:7–8). He explained that he was forceful in his letters, and that he would be forceful in person if he had to be (10:9–11).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">He told them that people who commend themselves are not wise (10:12). He explained that he boasted only in proper ways. One of those ways was boasting about the faith of people whom he had helped become believers, which included those in Corinth (10:13–15a). He told them that he hoped to preach the gospel in more regions (10:15b–16a). He explained further about proper things to boast about (10:16b–17). Lastly, he told them that God approves of people according to what God himself says in favor of them and not what a person boasts about himself (10:18).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s reply to accusations of weakness (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul Describes Himself (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul responded to some who had criticized him</p></blockquote></div><h4>10:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Now by the mildness and gentleness of Christ, I appeal to you—I, Paul,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Now I, Paul, urgently/strongly ask you<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">something</span> in the manner of the humbleness and forbearance of Christ.</p></li><li><p>¶ I myself, Paul, urge you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">here</span>. I speak as Christ would, meekly and gently.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Now by the mildness and gentleness of Christ, I appeal to you—I, Paul:</strong> The Greek words are literally “Now I myself Paul appeal to you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ.” Paul emphasized referring to himself here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I, Paul, myself entreat you, by the meekness and gentleness of Christ (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Now by the mildness and gentleness of Christ:</strong> Both <em>mildness</em> and <em>gentleness</em> are <em>of Christ</em>. Jesus showed both <em>mildness</em> and <em>gentleness</em> when he lived on earth. Paul lived according to the example that Jesus showed.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>mildness:</strong> This word refers to a person being considerate of others, not putting himself first and not wanting to argue. Another example is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>humble (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>gentleness:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>gentleness</em> refers to a person being patient when others do not do as he wishes. Such a person shows mercy to them and does not retaliate. Another example is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>forbearance (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Christ:</strong> The word <em>Christ</em> is a title for Jesus. The word <em>Christ</em> literally means “the anointed one.” Translate the word <em>Christ</em> here as you did in 1:1.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>appeal:</strong> This word refers to asking people to do as you say they should do. It does not mean “command.” Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>entreat (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>urge (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul did not say here what he was asking the Corinthians to do. But in 10:2 he implied that they should live according to their faith so he would not have to be bold and discipline those who sinned. He also said in 10:6 that he would punish every act of disobedience once their obedience was complete. So he was urging them to obey what he had said that they should do.</p><h4>10:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who am humble when face to face with you, but bold when away.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Some call</span> me cowardly when I am face to face with you but bold when I am away.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Certain people claim</span> I am timid before you and outspoken when I am away from you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and write to you</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who am humble when face to face with you, but bold when away:</strong> The word <em>who</em> indicates that Paul described himself in 10:1b. In some languages using the word “who” may indicate a different meaning or person. If that is true in your language, translate the correct meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am timid when face to face with you, but bold when away.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>am humble when face to face with you, but bold when away:</strong> Opponents of Paul accused him of being <em>humble when face to face</em> but <em>bold</em> when writing his letters to the believers in Corinth, as in 10:10. There are two ways to interpret these words:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate in a way that indicates that Paul <u>spoke of that accusation</u> here. One way to do this is to put the words <em>humble</em> and <em>bold</em> in quote marks. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who am “timid” when face to face with you, but “bold” toward you when away (NIV)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to do this is to translate the words in such a way as to show that someone else had spoken those words and that Paul did not agree with the accusation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>am said to be meek and mild when I am with you, but harsh with you when I am away (GNT) <em>(RSV, NIV, GNT, NASB, NLT, CEV, NET, REB, ESV, NCV)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The RSV, NASB, ESV, and NET use an exclamation point at the end of this text. That probably indicates that this statement is ironic. That would imply that this text is an accusation of Paul’s enemies in Corinth.</span></span></em></p></blockquote><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate in a way that implies that Paul <u>referred to himself</u> as having these attitudes. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>is so humble when he is facing you but full of boldness at a distance (NJB) <em>(BSB, NJB, NABRE, GW, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because Paul explained that accusation in 10:10.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Harris (p. 664) translates the text as “who face to face with you am ‘timid’ but when absent am ‘bold’.” Martin (p. 297) translates the text as “who am ‘timid’ when face to face with you, but when I am away, I am ‘haughty’ over you.” Thrall (p. 603) says, “Paul reproduces their criticism.”</span></span> Other ways to translate this following interpretation (1) are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">some call</span> timid when I am face to face with you but bold when away</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>even though some of you say I am bold in my letters but timid in person (NLT96)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Some people say that I am easy on you when I am with you and bold when I am away (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>humble:</strong> Following interpretation (1) in the previous note in 10:1b, this word would have the meaning of “timid” (as in the NIV). This would refer to lacking confidence or being afraid to speak an opinion that is different from others. It might also refer to thinking of everyone else as being of a higher status.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Following interpretation (2) in the previous note in 10:1b, this word would have the meaning of “humble” (as in the BSB). That would be a positive quality.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>a coward (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>bold:</strong> Following interpretation (1) in the previous note in 10:1b, this word would have a negative meaning, such as “outspoken” (as in JBP). It would refer to speaking an opinion without proper concern for the feelings and opinions of others.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Following interpretation (2) in the first note in 10:1b, this word would have a positive meaning, such as “brave” (CEV) or “courageous” (REB).</span></span></p>",

These people were trying to make the believers reject Paul as their leader (10:10, 11:5).

Paul asked the believers in Corinth to take care of the problems there. That was what he implied when he told them that he did not want to be bold with any of the believers there. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I urgently ask</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>my appeal to you is (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you:</strong> The BSB and many English versions add the pronoun <em>you</em> here. It is clearly implied from 10:1a. But the meaning may be clear in your language without repeating the implied pronoun here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>when I come:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>when I come</em> is literally “being present.” The Greek word refers to the time Paul would be staying with the believers in Corinth. This would be after he had sent the letter and then traveled to Corinth. Other ways to translate this Greek word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in your presence (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when I am with you (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>after I arrive</p></blockquote><h4>10:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I may not need to be as bold</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I should not have to be bold with the confidence</p></li><li><p>I will not need to be outspoken</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I may not need to be as bold:</strong> The Greek words are literally: “not to be bold in the confidence.” Paul expected to be confident when he was bold. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I may not have to show boldness with such confidence (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>as bold:</strong> Here the word <em>bold</em> refers to <u>openly and forcefully</u> opposing someone.

He would boldly oppose them and probably show by God’s power that they were not appointed by God. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I propose to be courageous (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>by daring to (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I expect I will have to be firm and forceful (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am sure I can deal harshly (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those:</strong> This word refers to the false teachers who had come to Corinth.

He explained how a believer fights against those who oppose God (10:3–4) and how to rebuke them as well as correct a disobedient believer (10:5–6).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">He told them to understand their situation, including Paul’s authority (10:7–8). He explained that he was forceful in his letters, and that he would be forceful in person if he had to be (10:9–11).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">He told them that people who commend themselves are not wise (10:12). He explained that he boasted only in proper ways. One of those ways was boasting about the faith of people whom he had helped become believers, which included those in Corinth (10:13–15a). He told them that he hoped to preach the gospel in more regions (10:15b–16a). He explained further about proper things to boast about (10:16b–17). Lastly, he told them that God approves of people according to what God himself says in favor of them and not what a person boasts about himself (10:18).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s reply to accusations of weakness (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul Describes Himself (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul responded to some who had criticized him</p></blockquote></div><h4>10:4a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:4a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The weapons of our warfare are not the weapons of the world.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For the weapons with which we<sup>(excl)</sup> do battle are not human weapons.</p></li><li><p>Fighting men use weapons made by people, but we use different weapons.</p></li><li><p>The methods/means we use to oppose <span data-bnType=\"implied\">our enemies/opponents</span> are not the methods/means that ungodly people use.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">10:4 begins with a Greek conjunction that introduces an explanation about how Paul and the other evangelists oppose other people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is more natural to allow the context to indicate the connection and omit the conjunction.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The weapons of our warfare are not the weapons of the world:</strong> This clause continues the metaphor about war from 10:3b. The <em>weapons</em> that Paul uses are not the same kind of weapons as the people of the world use. His weapons are from God (10:4b). They would include the gospel, prophecy, doing miracles, and things like that. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We fight with weapons that are different from those the world uses (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the weapons of the world:</strong> This phrase refers to the ways in which the world fights. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>human weapons (NET)</p></blockquote><h4>10:4b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:4b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Instead, they have divine power to demolish strongholds.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Instead, they have power to destroy fortresses on God’s behalf.</p></li><li><p>Our weapons have God’s power to destroy/ruin <span data-bnType=\"implied\">spiritual</span> strong places <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of his enemies</span>.</p></li><li><p>Our methods/means have the power of God to tear down the places of strength <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of our enemies/opponents</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they have divine power:</strong> The Greek words are literally “powerful to/for/through God.” God gives this power. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s powerful weapons (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>powerful in God’s warfare (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>powerful weapons from God (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>they:</strong> Here this pronoun refers to “the weapons of our warfare” in 10:4a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>demolish strongholds:</strong> Like strongholds in human warfare, the enemies of God have spiritual <em>strongholds</em>. But the weapons of believers can <em>demolish</em> them. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>destroy strongholds (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>destroy <span data-bnType=\"implied\">spiritual</span> strong places <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the enemies of God</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>strongholds:</strong> This word refers to places easy to defend against attack. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>fortresses (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the enemy’s strong places (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, the word here is used figuratively for “arguments” (10:5a). Any opposition to the gospel of Jesus is a stronghold. In some languages a literal translation of this word would wrongly refer only to places on earth. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 10:4a–b</strong></h5><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Explain its meaning in your translation.

An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Here, the word “stronghold” refers to any opposition to the gospel of Jesus.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul first explained what the weapons were not and then explained what the weapons were. In some languages it is more natural to explain what the weapons were first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>4a</sup>The weapons we fight with <sup>4b</sup>have divine power to demolish strongholds. They <sup>4a</sup>are not the weapons of the world.</p></blockquote></div>",

These pretensions oppose true knowledge, so the person believing these pretensions opposes God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the knowledge of God:</strong> This phrase refers to knowing who God is and knowing the kinds of things he does.

He explained how a believer fights against those who oppose God (10:3–4) and how to rebuke them as well as correct a disobedient believer (10:5–6).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">He told them to understand their situation, including Paul’s authority (10:7–8). He explained that he was forceful in his letters, and that he would be forceful in person if he had to be (10:9–11).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">He told them that people who commend themselves are not wise (10:12). He explained that he boasted only in proper ways. One of those ways was boasting about the faith of people whom he had helped become believers, which included those in Corinth (10:13–15a). He told them that he hoped to preach the gospel in more regions (10:15b–16a). He explained further about proper things to boast about (10:16b–17). Lastly, he told them that God approves of people according to what God himself says in favor of them and not what a person boasts about himself (10:18).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s reply to accusations of weakness (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul Describes Himself (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul responded to some who had criticized him</p></blockquote></div><h4>10:8a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:8a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For even if I boast somewhat excessively about the authority the Lord gave us</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For if I indeed might talk proudly a little too much about our<sup>(excl)</sup> authority, which the Lord gave</p></li><li><p>Perhaps <span data-bnType=\"implied\">some of</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you think</span> that I talk/boast a bit too much about the authority that the Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus</span> gave to us.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> This conjunction introduces an explanation of something about Paul and the others belonging to Christ. In some languages it is more natural to allow the context to indicate the connection and omit the conjunction.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>even:</strong> Here the word <em>even</em> emphasizes the words that follow. Another way to translate this word is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if I indeed boast</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if I boast:</strong> The word <em>if</em> is used rhetorically. Paul wanted the believers in Corinth to think about whether Paul boasted about the authority that Jesus gave to him as an apostle. Paul probably expected that some of the Corinthians believed that he boasted too much about that. But Paul indicated that those people had to realize that he did that to strengthen the believers, not to belittle them (10:8b). Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Maybe I brag (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages translating literally would imply that Paul did not know or was unsure whether he boasted freely about his authority. If that is true in your language, indicate the correct meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when I boast</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">some of you may think</span> that I boast</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I boast:</strong> Here the word <em>boast</em> refers to talking about the things that God did through Paul and the others. Paul felt he needed to <em>boast</em> to encourage the believers in Corinth (10:8b). He did not <em>boast</em> for selfish reasons.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, the word <em>boast</em> only refers to talking big about oneself in a selfish way. A person often boasts to make others think well of him. Paul would <em>boast</em>, but he would do so in this letter to encourage the believers in Corinth. So if the word <em>boast</em> only refers to selfish talk in your language, you may want to translate using a different word or phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I talk about my good deeds</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>somewhat excessively:</strong> There are three ways to interpret the Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>somewhat excessively</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Greek phrase refers to boasting <u>somewhat too much</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a little too much (RSV) <em>(BSB, RSV, GNT, NJB, NABRE, NLT, GW, CEV, REB, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Greek phrase refers to boasting <u>much but not too much</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>freely (NCV) <em>(NIV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Greek phrase refers to boasting <u>somewhat more</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>somewhat further (NASB) <em>(NASB, NET, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Harris (p. 664) translates as in the RSV. Kistemaker (p. 327) translates the text as “somewhat excessively.” Hughes (on TW) translates it as “somewhat abundantly.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the authority the Lord gave us:</strong> This phrase refers to the authority as apostles and evangelists that Jesus had given to Paul and the others. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>our authority, which the Lord gave (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the authority given to us by the Lord (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the authority that the Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus</span> gave to us</p></blockquote><h4>10:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for building you up rather than tearing you down, I will not be ashamed.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to build your<sup>(plur)</sup> faith rather than destroy it, I will not be ashamed of doing that.</p></li><li><p>I do so/that in order to help you to become mature believers rather than hindering the way you believe. But no one can make me feel shame about such boasting.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for:</strong> Here the word <em>for</em> introduces the purpose for Paul’s authority.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>building you up:</strong> The verb phrase <em>building…up</em> refers figuratively to encouraging the believers so that they believe, love, and obey Jesus well. If the verb phrase <em>building…up</em> does not have that figurative meaning in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Explain the metaphor in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to build your faith (REB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to help you (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to help your faith grow</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>tearing you down:</strong> The verb phrase <em>tearing…down</em> usually refers to destroying something. The BSB translates this Greek word as “demolish” in 10:4b. Here it refers figuratively to discouraging the believers from believing, loving, and obeying Jesus well. If the verb phrase <em>tearing…down</em> does not have that figurative meaning in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Explain the metaphor in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>pull your faith down, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">making it ineffective/useless</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to hurt you (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to make your faith ineffective/useless</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will not be ashamed:</strong> The Greek words are literally “I will not be put to shame.” Paul would not accept the effort of anyone trying to shame him about this boast.</p>",

He did not even want them to think that he was <u>trying</u> to frighten them. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I do not want to seem as though I am trying to frighten you with my letters (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I do not wish to seem as if I would terrify you by my letters (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I do not want you to think I am trying to scare you with my letters (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>frighten:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>frighten</em> probably means “cause to be very much afraid.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>terrify (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by my letters:</strong> Sometimes, Paul wrote very forcefully in his letters.

Here the Greek words indicate that 10:10b refers to opinions about one situation (Paul being away) and 10:10c refers to other opinions about a contrasting situation (Paul being in Corinth).

Paul’s opponents complimented his letters only to contrast with criticizing him in 10:10c–d.

However, many languages must choose. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Thrall (p. 630) says it “more probably means ‘weighty’ in the sense of ‘impressive’.

He explained how a believer fights against those who oppose God (10:3–4) and how to rebuke them as well as correct a disobedient believer (10:5–6).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">He told them to understand their situation, including Paul’s authority (10:7–8). He explained that he was forceful in his letters, and that he would be forceful in person if he had to be (10:9–11).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">He told them that people who commend themselves are not wise (10:12). He explained that he boasted only in proper ways. One of those ways was boasting about the faith of people whom he had helped become believers, which included those in Corinth (10:13–15a). He told them that he hoped to preach the gospel in more regions (10:15b–16a). He explained further about proper things to boast about (10:16b–17). Lastly, he told them that God approves of people according to what God himself says in favor of them and not what a person boasts about himself (10:18).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s reply to accusations of weakness (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul Describes Himself (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul responded to some who had criticized him</p></blockquote></div><h4>10:12a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:12a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ For we<sup>(excl)</sup> would not risk classifying/ranking ourselves or compare ourselves with some people who recommend themselves <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as qualified</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be your leaders</span>.</p></li><li><p>¶ Some people praise themselves <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about how important they are</span>.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Many English versions allow the context to indicate the connection and omit the conjunction.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves:</strong> Paul used irony here. He wrote as if the false teachers were true apostles and he was not. But Paul knew that he was a true apostle and they were not. So the irony showed that he was different from them and was actually greater than them. The irony also implies that those people were wrong to <em>commend themselves</em>. Translate in a way that clearly shows the irony. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Of course we would not dare classify ourselves or compare ourselves with those who rate themselves so highly. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Oh, don’t worry; we wouldn’t dare say that we are as wonderful as these other men who tell you how important they are! (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We really are cowards so we do not rank or compare ourselves with some of the people there who call themselves great <span data-bnType=\"implied\">leaders</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would not have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate these words in a way that explains the irony. Your translation should indicate or imply that the false teachers were wrong to commend themselves. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Some people there commend themselves. Should we be bold enough to classify or compare ourselves to them? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">No way!</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We should/will not classify or compare ourselves to some people there who <span data-bnType=\"implied\">wrongly</span> commend themselves</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Classifying or comparing ourselves to some people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">there</span> who commend themselves is worthless.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Some people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">are with you and they</span> praise themselves saying, “We are good/great people, respect us.” But as for us, in no way do we want to say that the ways of those people and our own ways are the same.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate literally and explain the irony in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul used irony here. He wrote as if the false teachers were true apostles and he was not. But Paul knew that he was a true apostle and they were not.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>We do not dare:</strong> The word <em>dare</em> refers to being bold in regard to doing something risky. For example, jumping off a high bridge might be dangerous, but someone challenges you to jump. Here Paul used irony to pretend that comparing themselves with the false teachers was risky or dangerous, because they might be found to be inferior (in this irony). Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We do not risk</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We are not so bold as</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>classify:</strong> This word refers to the effort to decide if one thing is the same sort of thing as another. The false teachers claimed to be apostles. But Paul did not think it worthwhile to think about whether he was like them, or whether they were like him, because he already knew they were false teachers. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>class (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>rank (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>say we are the same kind of person</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>say we have the same kind of status</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>some who commend themselves:</strong> Here the word <em>commend</em> indicates that they boasted about themselves to the believers in Corinth so that the believers would accept them and follow their teaching. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>these other men who tell you how important they are (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>some people who recommend themselves</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who write their own testimonials (JBP)</p></blockquote><h4>10:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>When they measure themselves by themselves</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But when they measure themselves by one another (RSV)</p></li><li><p>Those <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who proclaim how great/important they are</span> say that their colleagues/friends behavior is good and then judge themselves by it</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">10:12b begins with a Greek conjunction that is often translated as “but” (as in the NASB). Here it indicates that 10:12b–c contrasts with 10:12a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is more natural to allow the context to indicate the contrast and omit the conjunction.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they measure themselves by themselves:</strong> This clause indicates that the false teachers used their own behavior as a standard of goodness. They said that it was correct and proper. They did not look to see what Scripture said were correct behavior and beliefs. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they measure themselves by one another (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They make up their own standards to measure themselves by (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they…measure themselves by their own standards (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they say that they are good in their own sight/measure/guideline</p></blockquote><h4>10:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and compare themselves with themselves, they show their ignorance.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and compare themselves with one another, they are without understanding.

Lastly, he told them that God approves of people according to what God himself says in favor of them and not what a person boasts about himself (10:18).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s reply to accusations of weakness (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul Describes Himself (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul responded to some who had criticized him</p></blockquote></div><h4>10:13–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>We, however, will not boast beyond our limits, but only within the field of influence that God has assigned to us:</strong> The Greek words are literally “now we do not boast in unmeasured (amounts) but according to the measure of the sphere that God measured to us with a measure.” Here Paul used the same idea, “measure,” in four different ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As its negated or opposite idea (“unmeasured”).</p></li><li><p>As a calculation (“the measure [of the sphere]”).</p></li><li><p>As the action of marking something out (“measured to us”).</p></li><li><p>As the means of making a measurement (“[with] a measure”).</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">He first denied that he boasts without limits. He then described what was acceptable as boasting. They could boast only about work that God had given responsibility to them for.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Generally, English versions do not try to use the word “measure” or a similar word four times, since that would not be natural English. But some versions use the word three times to try to mimic Paul’s repeated use of the word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But we will not boast beyond our measure, but within the measure of the domain which God assigned to us as a measure (NASB)</p></blockquote><h4>10:13a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:13a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>We, however, will not boast beyond our limits,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But as for us<sup>(excl)</sup>, we will not talk proudly about things outside of the duties that God has given to us,</p></li><li><p>But we, on the other hand, will not talk/boast about things we do not have the right to talk/boast about.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>We, however, will not boast beyond our limits:</strong> The <em>limits</em> for boasting are explained in 10:13b–16. Paul would boast about what God had done through him. He had been the first to preach in Corinth (10:13c). He would not boast about what others had done, as if he had done those things himself (10:15–16). Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But we will not boast beyond our measure (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We will not boast about things done outside our area of authority (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We won’t brag about something we don’t have a right to brag about (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We will not boast about changed lives in places that result from someone else’s preaching</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>We:</strong> This pronoun is emphasized in the Greek. It emphasizes the contrast between the false teachers (“they” in 10:12) and Paul and his coworkers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>As for us (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>boast:</strong> The word <em>boast</em> refers to talking proudly about something. Here it refers to the things that God had done through Paul and the other evangelists. Paul felt he needed to <em>boast</em> to encourage the believers in Corinth. He did not <em>boast</em> for selfish reasons. See how you translated this word in 10:8.</p><h4>10:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but only within the field of influence that God has assigned to us—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but we will limit what we talk proudly about to the area <span data-bnType=\"implied\">s</span> that God assigned to us.</p></li><li><p>But we will only talk/boast about the deeds that God authorized us to do.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but only within the field of influence:</strong> This phrase refers to limiting what they boasted about. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but within the measure of the domain (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We will boast only about what has happened within the boundaries of the work (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We will only brag about the work (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the field of influence:</strong> The Greek words are literally “the measure/limit of the sphere/region.” The Greek word “of” indicates here that “sphere” explains what is “limited.” The word “sphere” refers here to all of Paul’s ministry. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the limits of the work (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>field:</strong> The Greek word is literally “sphere/region.” The Greek word and the English word <em>field</em> refer here to all of Paul’s ministry. This includes the people groups and places where God had sent them to preach and evangelize. Acts 13:1–21:16 tells about the cities where Paul and his coworkers went, preached, and evangelized. They preached mainly to non-Jews, but they usually offered the opportunity to believe in Jesus to the Jews in those cities first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>regions/peoples</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the area (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to refer to the ministry done in those places rather than the places themselves. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>work (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>10:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>a field that reaches even to you.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>This area also includes you.</p></li><li><p>And, indeed, God authorized us to minister/work in your city.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a field that reaches even to you:</strong> Corinth was one of the places where God had sent Paul to preach and evangelize. So this phrase indicates that Corinth and the believers there were included in that <em>field</em>.

Paul was the first to evangelize in Corinth.

He explained how a believer fights against those who oppose God (10:3–4) and how to rebuke them as well as correct a disobedient believer (10:5–6).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">He told them to understand their situation, including Paul’s authority (10:7–8). He explained that he was forceful in his letters, and that he would be forceful in person if he had to be (10:9–11).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">He told them that people who commend themselves are not wise (10:12). He explained that he boasted only in proper ways. One of those ways was boasting about the faith of people whom he had helped become believers, which included those in Corinth (10:13–15a). He told them that he hoped to preach the gospel in more regions (10:15b–16a). He explained further about proper things to boast about (10:16b–17). Lastly, he told them that God approves of people according to what God himself says in favor of them and not what a person boasts about himself (10:18).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples of headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s reply to accusations of weakness (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul Describes Himself (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul responded to some who had criticized him</p></blockquote></div><h4>10:15a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:15a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Neither do we boast beyond our limits in the labors of others.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>We<sup>(excl)</sup> do not boast beyond limit, that is, in the labors of others.</p></li><li><p>We do not talk proudly <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for selfish gain</span> about work/ministry done by others, since such talk is outside of what is proper.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Neither do we boast beyond our limits in the labors of others:</strong> The Greek words are literally “in the (things) beyond measure boasting in others’ labors.” It indicates two things:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some kinds of boasting in <em>the labors of others</em> are acceptable. This is probably boasting that praises those people who did the work.</p></li><li><p>Some kinds of boasting in <em>the labors of others</em> are not acceptable. This is probably boasting about being responsible for the work when they were not.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">For example, Paul would not have boasted about Peter’s work as if he (Paul) had done that work himself or was responsible for it. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We do not boast beyond limits, that is, in the labors of others (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we do not boast of work done where others have laboured, work beyond our proper sphere (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We limit our bragging to the work that is ours, not what others have done (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>boast beyond our limits in the labors of others:</strong> This clause refers to a wrong kind of boasting. This kind of <em>boast</em> claims to be responsible for work done by others, when the person who boasts was not responsible for that work.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would not have the correct meaning. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain the correct meaning in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">selfish</span> boasting of work done by others</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>boasting of work done by others <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as if we had done the work ourselves</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>boasting of work done by others <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as if the credit/responsibility was ours</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>labors:</strong> Here the word <em>labors</em> refers to doing things for God such as preaching and evangelizing. The Greek word often implies <u>hard</u> work. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>hard work</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>ministry</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>work <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of God</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>what others <u>have done</u> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for God</span></p></blockquote><h4>10:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But we hope that as your faith increases,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>As your<sup>(plur)</sup> faith/believing becomes stronger, we expect that</p></li><li><p>As you believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Jesus</span> more and more, we have confidence that</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>hope:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>hope</em> means “confidence about something happening.” Paul expected their faith to grow and that would cause him to have more opportunities to preach and teach among them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>confidence (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as your faith increases:</strong> This phrase refers to the believers’ <em>faith</em> in Jesus increasing. As this happened, they would have fewer doubts and trust him to do more and more in their lives. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as your faith continues to grow (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as you become stronger in your faith (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as your believing becomes great/large</p></blockquote><h4>10:15c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:15c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>our area of influence among you will greatly increase as well,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>our area of influence among you may be greatly enlarged, (ESV)</p></li><li><p>our work among you will grow/extend greatly.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>our area of influence among you will greatly increase as well:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>our area of influence</em> is literally “according to our sphere/region.” There are several ways to interpret this phrase. The three main ways are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Greek phrase refers to <u>the places, people, and ministries where Paul was already working</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>our field among you may be greatly enlarged (RSV) <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, NASB, NLT, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Greek phrase refers to <u>what is limited</u> (10:15a). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>always within the limits that God has set (GNT) <em>(GNT, NET, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Greek phrase refers to <u>a standard or rule</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>by this standard of ours (NJB) <em>(NJB, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Harris (p. 705) translates this phrase as “in accordance with our assignment.” Martin (p. 322) translates the Greek phrase as “within the sphere we have.” Kistemaker (p. 349) translates it as “our sphere of influence.” Furnish (p. 465) translates it as “in accord with our jurisdiction.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>our area of influence:</strong> The word <em>area</em> refers figuratively to the people groups and places where God had sent them to preach and evangelize. The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>area of influence</em> is translated “field” in 10:13b. The meaning is similar in both places. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>regions/peoples</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>our sphere of activity (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we will be able to reach many more of the people around you (CEV)</p></blockquote>",

The GNT changes its interpretation of the Greek word here and says “when we think well of ourselves.” If you followed the wording in the GNT in 10:12, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate here as the BSB and other English versions do.

He described the way he would speak as “foolishness.” Paul used the term “foolishness” here in a special way. In this chapter Paul said he was “foolish” because he praised himself for his own good character, attitudes, and actions. He called this praise “foolish” especially because he had just said in 10:17–18 that believers should not praise themselves.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul was very concerned for the believers in Corinth, like a father wanting his daughter to be faithful to the man whom she would marry one day (11:2). In the same way he worried that the false teachers might have led the believers away from following Jesus (11:3–4).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Since the false teachers had deceived some of the believers in Corinth, Paul had to defend himself to the believers (11:5–6). The false teachers had praised themselves and some of the believers had believed them, so Paul had to praise himself. He reminded them that he had not allowed them to support him. He wanted them to know that he was serving them because he truly loved them and wanted to help them, unlike the false teachers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek culture, a teacher expected those whom he taught to support him. It was an honor to support a well-known teacher. But Paul had not let the believers in Corinth support him. Using irony, Paul asked them if they were upset about his not letting them support him (11:7). Using irony again, he told them that churches in other cities had supported him while he lived in Corinth so that he could serve them full time (11:8–9). But the false teachers probably did the culturally expected thing and accepted money from the believers. Paul explained that he loved the believers in Corinth and therefore had not accepted their money (11:10–11). This example of love showed that the false teachers were not equals with Paul as apostles (11:12). He described the false teachers as claiming to be apostles while actually following Satan (11:13–15).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples for this section heading are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul Contrasts Himself With False Apostles (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul and His Opponents (NET)</p></blockquote></div><h4>11:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I hope you will bear with a little of my foolishness,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ I wish/desire that you<sup>(plur)</sup> would allow me to be a little foolish.</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">You accept others who commend themselves, so</span> please tolerate me while I act a little like a foolish/silly person.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I hope you will bear with a little of my foolishness:</strong> Paul told the believers that they should only boast in what the Lord does (10:17–18). In 10:12 he referred to people who commended themselves, and in 10:18 he implied that it was not good for people to do that.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">But here he asked them to allow him to commend himself. Doing that was foolish. He did so because the false teachers had been foolishly and boastfully commending themselves. The believers had been listening to the foolish boasting of the false teachers. He wanted to commend himself a little to show the believers that he had better credentials than the false teachers. In some languages it is more natural to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Introduce this change in topic with some implied information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Those false teachers act foolishly yet you listen to them, so</span> I hope you will bear with a little of my foolishness</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You accept others who commend themselves, so</span> I hope you will put up with a little of my foolishness</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Explain this change in topic in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Here Paul asked the believers to allow him to commend himself a little. He did so because the false teachers had been foolishly commending themselves with boasts about themselves. Some believers had accepted these boasts as reasons to follow the false teachers. Paul wanted to boast a little to show the believers that they should accept him instead.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I hope:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>I hope</em> refers to a desire for something to happen. The Greek word usually indicates that the person does not expect it to happen. But Paul was probably speaking ironically here and was hoping that the believers would do as he desired. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I wish (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I should like (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Please (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you will bear with:</strong> This phrase refers to tolerating something. Paul wanted the believers to allow him to be a little foolish. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you will put up with (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you will tolerate/permit/allow</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a little of my foolishness:</strong> The word <em>little</em> refers here to Paul being foolish for a short time.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>foolishness:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>foolishness</em> often refers to doing things that make no sense for a good moral person to do. It does not refer here to being intellectually stupid. Paul will praise himself later in his letter. Praising oneself is foolish if the purpose is to make oneself look better than others. But he boasted in this letter to show the believers in Corinth that he could have boasted earlier but had stopped himself from doing so. This was because he had wanted them to believe the gospel because of its truth rather than because of Paul’s credentials.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here some languages may need to express the idea of <em>foolishness</em> in different ways. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>silly boasting</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>foolishly praising myself</p></blockquote><h4>11:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but you are already doing that.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Indeed, allow me to do that.</p></li><li><p>Look/Yes, let me do so/that!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but:</strong> The Greek words here are literally “but even.” The second word emphasizes the clause that follows. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but indeed (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you are already doing that:</strong> The Greek words are literally “you<sup>(plur)</sup> tolerate me” or “tolerate me.” The word “tolerate” is the same word as in 11:1a that the BSB translates as “bear with.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek clause here can either be a statement or a command. There are two ways to interpret this clause:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is <u>a command (or request) to tolerate Paul’s foolishness</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do bear with me! (RSV) <em>(RSV, GNT, NABRE, NLT, CEV, REB, ESV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is <u>a statement that the believers were already tolerating Paul’s foolishness</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are bearing with me (NASB) <em>(BSB, NIV, NJB, NASB, GW, NET, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Harris (p. 730) translates the Greek text as “Yes, do put up with me!” He says it is “an unambiguous request…an imperative” (p. 733). Thrall translates it as “Now do tolerate me” (p. 659). She believes that the context suggests the imperative. Martin translates it as “Yes, please put up with me!” (p. 327).</span></span> Other ways to translate this clause following interpretation (1) are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Please try and tolerate me</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Please do!

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My reason is that</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I ask this</span> because</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Many English versions, including the BSB, allow the context to indicate the connection and omit the conjunction.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I am jealous for you:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>jealous</em> indicates concern or zeal for someone to do the right thing. Paul had zeal for the believers in Corinth to follow God and reject the false teachers. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am…concerned about you (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I’m protective of you (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I greatly/strongly desire/want you to follow Christ completely/exclusively</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a godly jealousy:</strong> This phrase is literally “jealousy of God.” It implies that Paul’s feelings about the Corinthians were like the feelings that God has about his people. God is concerned for them. He protects them. He wants them to worship only him. When they begin to follow idols or false teachings, God has often used the metaphor of a husband jealous for his wife who acted like a prostitute. God wants his people to return to him. Paul had that same kind of feelings for the church in Corinth. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s own jealousy (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the jealousy of God himself (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>11:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For I promised you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I promised you as a pure bride to one husband—Christ.

Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>since (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Many English versions allow the context to indicate the connection and omit the conjunction.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I promised you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ:</strong> This is a metaphor. Paul had promised the believers in Corinth to Christ. He compared that with a father presenting his daughter <em>as a pure virgin</em> to a man in marriage. Paul wanted the believers to follow Christ completely and no one else. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are like a pure virgin whom I have promised in marriage to one man only, Christ himself (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I promised you as a pure bride to one husband—Christ (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I promised to give you to Christ, as your only husband. I want to give you as his pure bride. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages the meaning of this metaphor is not clear. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Change the metaphor to a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I promised to give you to Christ, and to him alone, as a father gives his daughter as a pure virgin to her husband <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when they marry</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I promised to present you to Christ as a people devoted to him, and to him alone. This is like the way a father presents his daughter to her husband <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when they marry</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I promised to give/present you to Christ, as a people devoted only/completely to him <em>You may then want to give the literal words in a footnote. An example footnote is:</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Literally “I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might present you as a pure virgin to him.”</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a pure virgin:</strong> Here this phrase refers to a woman who has not had sexual relations. In the metaphor, it refers to the believers following only Jesus and not following any false teachings.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ:</strong> The word <em>Christ</em> is a title for Jesus.

He called this praise “foolish” especially because he had just said in 10:17–18 that believers should not praise themselves.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul was very concerned for the believers in Corinth, like a father wanting his daughter to be faithful to the man whom she would marry one day (11:2). In the same way he worried that the false teachers might have led the believers away from following Jesus (11:3–4).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Since the false teachers had deceived some of the believers in Corinth, Paul had to defend himself to the believers (11:5–6). The false teachers had praised themselves and some of the believers had believed them, so Paul had to praise himself. He reminded them that he had not allowed them to support him. He wanted them to know that he was serving them because he truly loved them and wanted to help them, unlike the false teachers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek culture, a teacher expected those whom he taught to support him. It was an honor to support a well-known teacher. But Paul had not let the believers in Corinth support him. Using irony, Paul asked them if they were upset about his not letting them support him (11:7). Using irony again, he told them that churches in other cities had supported him while he lived in Corinth so that he could serve them full time (11:8–9). But the false teachers probably did the culturally expected thing and accepted money from the believers. Paul explained that he loved the believers in Corinth and therefore had not accepted their money (11:10–11). This example of love showed that the false teachers were not equals with Paul as apostles (11:12). He described the false teachers as claiming to be apostles while actually following Satan (11:13–15).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples for this section heading are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul Contrasts Himself With False Apostles (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul and His Opponents (NET)</p></blockquote></div><h4>11:4a–e</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For if someone comes and proclaims a Jesus other than the One we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit than the One you received, or a different gospel than the one you accepted, you put up with it way too easily:</strong> Paul used the words <em>For if</em> rhetorically to cause the believers in Corinth to consider those situations in which someone had preached a different gospel.

The false teachers follow an evil spirit rather than the Holy Spirit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you accept a spirit…completely different from the Spirit (GNT) <em>(GNT, NIV11, NLT, GW, CEV, REB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>A <u>way of living or thinking</u>.

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because the phrase <em>a different spirit</em> occurs with “a Jesus other than the One we proclaimed” and “a different gospel” in this verse, so Paul is likely thinking of a substitute for the Holy Spirit.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Harris (p. 744). Hodge, Bruce, and Martin also support interpretation (1).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this according to interpretation (1):</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you receive/accept a different spirit, not the one you received/accepted from us</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>receive:</strong> Here the word <em>receive</em> refers to accepting what someone says as true. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>accept (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>acknowledge as true</p></blockquote><h4>11:4d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:4d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>or a different gospel than the one you accepted,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>or <span data-bnType=\"implied\">if you accept</span> a different gospel, not the one you accepted from us,</p></li><li><p>or news different from the good news about Jesus,</p></li><li><p>He tells you what he calls the gospel of Jesus but it is different from what we taught you earlier and you accepted.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>or a different gospel than the one you accepted:</strong> The words “if you receive” are implied from 11:4c but are not repeated here.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>or <span data-bnType=\"implied\">if you receive/accept</span> a different gospel from the one you accepted</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a different gospel than the one you accepted:</strong> The false teachers changed some of the teachings in the gospel of Jesus to their own teachings. So their <em>gospel</em> was <em>different</em> or false. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a false gospel, not the one you received/accepted <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from us</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>adopt a different gospel <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about Jesus</span> that disagrees with what <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we</span> taught</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">receive</span> a different meaning to the good news about Jesus than you received/did <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from us</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a changed/deceitful message <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about Jesus</span> that is different from the one you accepted <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from us</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>their own lies that they claim to be the good news <span data-bnType=\"implied\">concerning Jesus</span> as opposed to the true gospel that you received <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from us</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>gospel:</strong> You may not be able to translate <em>gospel</em> in the usual way here.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>4c</sup>or if you receive a different spirit <sup>4d</sup>or a different gospel <sup>4c</sup>from the one you received</p></blockquote></div><h4>11:4e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:4e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>you put up with it way too easily.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">that is wrong, but</span>you do it eagerly!</p></li><li><p>you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">wrongly</span> accept it wholeheartedly!</p></li><li><p>And you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">change your mind and</span> accept these differences/changes! <span data-bnType=\"implied\">That is wrong!</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you put up with it way too easily:</strong> The Greek indicates that Paul used irony here. He wrote as if to commend them for tolerating the false teachers. But he was actually rebuking them for doing that. Translate in a way that clearly shows the irony. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you bear this beautifully (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you eagerly accept it</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You happily put up with whatever anyone tells you (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages the irony must be explained in the translation so that the correct meaning is clear. Your translation should indicate a rebuke. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you wrongly accept it wholeheartedly!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Why do you accept it? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">That is wrong!</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you put up with:</strong> These words refer to tolerating something.

This pronoun refers to the false teachings regarding the “different” Jesus, spirit, and gospel.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For (NASB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Allow the context to imply a general connection and omit the conjunction.

So he did not think of himself as having a lower status than the status that the false teachers claimed for themselves. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I consider that I am not in the least inferior to (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I think I am as good as (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those “super-apostles”:</strong> The phrase <em>super-apostles</em> is sarcasm. It refers to the false teachers. The phrase means “better than all other apostles.” With this phrase, Paul mocked them and their attitude of thinking that they were better than Paul. The BSB puts quotes around the words <em>super-apostles</em> to indicate the sarcasm more clearly in English. Translate this phrase so that it clearly shows the sarcasm. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those very special so-called “apostles” (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those “great apostles” (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those who are reportedly the highest apostles</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those very superior/special “apostle.”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages the sarcasm must be explained in your translation to indicate the correct meaning. Your translation should indicate that Paul is mocking them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who act as if they are the greatest <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of all</span> apostles</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who behave as if they were the apostles greater than all others</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those greatest apostles, if only in their attitude toward others</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>apostles:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>apostles</em> means “ambassadors” or “messengers.” Here, <em>apostles</em> are people whom Jesus sends to represent him and teach his message with authority. See how you translated this word in 1:1. Or see the word apostle in the Glossary.</p>",

He described the way he would speak as “foolishness.” Paul used the term “foolishness” here in a special way. In this chapter Paul said he was “foolish” because he praised himself for his own good character, attitudes, and actions. He called this praise “foolish” especially because he had just said in 10:17–18 that believers should not praise themselves.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul was very concerned for the believers in Corinth, like a father wanting his daughter to be faithful to the man whom she would marry one day (11:2). In the same way he worried that the false teachers might have led the believers away from following Jesus (11:3–4).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Since the false teachers had deceived some of the believers in Corinth, Paul had to defend himself to the believers (11:5–6). The false teachers had praised themselves and some of the believers had believed them, so Paul had to praise himself. He reminded them that he had not allowed them to support him. He wanted them to know that he was serving them because he truly loved them and wanted to help them, unlike the false teachers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek culture, a teacher expected those whom he taught to support him. It was an honor to support a well-known teacher. But Paul had not let the believers in Corinth support him. Using irony, Paul asked them if they were upset about his not letting them support him (11:7). Using irony again, he told them that churches in other cities had supported him while he lived in Corinth so that he could serve them full time (11:8–9). But the false teachers probably did the culturally expected thing and accepted money from the believers. Paul explained that he loved the believers in Corinth and therefore had not accepted their money (11:10–11). This example of love showed that the false teachers were not equals with Paul as apostles (11:12). He described the false teachers as claiming to be apostles while actually following Satan (11:13–15).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples for this section heading are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul Contrasts Himself With False Apostles (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul and His Opponents (NET)</p></blockquote></div><h4>11:7a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Was it a sin for me to humble myself in order to exalt you, because I preached the gospel of God to you free of charge?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. It emphasizes the fact that it was <u>not</u> a sin for Paul to lower himself in order to elevate the believers. Translate this with that meaning. Some ways to translate it are:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Could it possibly be a sin for me to lower myself in order to elevate you by preaching the gospel of God to you free of charge?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>How can it be a sin for me to lower myself in order to elevate you by preaching the gospel of God to you free of charge?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I did not charge you a thing when I preached the Good News of God to you; I humbled myself in order to make you important.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It was certainly not a sin for me to lower myself in order to elevate you by preaching the gospel of God to you free of charge.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a command. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not think that I sinned when I lowered myself in order to elevate you by preaching the gospel of God to you free of charge!</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>11:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Was it a sin for me to humble myself in order to exalt you,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Can it be that I sinned when I humbled myself in order to cause you<sup>(plur)</sup> to have high status,</p></li><li><p>¶ Surely I did not sin when I humbled myself so that you might be exalted/honored,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>humble myself:</strong> This phrase refers to Paul humbling himself. He did not act like a worldly leader and make demands. Instead he served them and supported himself by making tents (Acts 18:1–5). Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>lower myself (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I made myself unimportant (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I did what lower class <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people do</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul may have been also thinking of a common Greek attitude. They believed that a free citizen should not do manual labor (such as making tents), because that made him like a slave or lower class person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in order to exalt you:</strong> This phrase refers to causing someone to have high status. Before Paul came, the people in Corinth lived apart from God. Now the believers had a relationship with God through Jesus Christ. So through Paul’s ministry, the believers in Corinth became of high status in God’s eyes. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that you might be raised up (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in order to make you important (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in order to give/confer high status to you</p></blockquote><h4>11:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because I preached the gospel of God to you free of charge?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">which I did</span> by proclaiming the gospel of God without cost to you?</p></li><li><p>because I did not accept any pay from you while I preached God’s message to you!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the gospel of God:</strong> This phrase refers to the good news about Jesus and restoring people’s relationship with God. In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer to something other than the gospel of Jesus. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Explain in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the gospel of God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">concerning Jesus</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate literally and explain the meaning in a footnote. An example footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This refers to the gospel of Jesus.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>free of charge:</strong> This phrase refers to not taking pay. Paul did not allow the Corinthians to give him money when he preached and taught among them. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>without cost (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>without taking money <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for my work/ministry</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some Greek wise men (Sophists) said that if someone taught without receiving pay, then their teaching was worth nothing. This may have been part of the accusation of those “super-apostles” against Paul.</p>",

He wrote as if he had stolen money from <em>other churches</em>. But actually the <em>other churches</em> had given money to Paul willingly. He had accepted this money so that he could spend more time preaching and teaching in Corinth rather than working to earn money.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul probably used irony here to show the believers that it was proper for him to preach free of charge in Corinth (11:7b). He did not accept their money, so they did not have the honor of supporting him. In that way some people may have claimed he <em>robbed</em> the believers in the other churches. If possible, show the irony clearly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I was robbing other churches, taking wages from them in order to work for you (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It was an act of robbery when I received support from other churches so as to serve you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>While I was working among you, I was paid by other churches. I was robbing them, so to speak, in order to help you (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I became <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> a thief, taking money from other churches in order to serve you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages the irony must be explained in your translation to indicate the correct meaning. Your translation should indicate that Paul was trying to correct their wrong attitude. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I accepted contributions from other churches so I could serve you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">at no cost</span>. Do not call that robbery!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I received support from other churches so as to serve you. You should not say that doing so is wrong!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It was certainly not wrong when I received support from other churches so as to serve you!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>churches:</strong> Here the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>churches</em> refers generally to more than one gathering of people. Here, as almost always in the New Testament, it refers to groups of believers. See how you translated this word in 1:1 or 8:18.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>support:</strong> This word refers to money that the other churches gave to Paul so that he could pay for his needs. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>contributions (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>money (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>serve:</strong> This word refers to the work of helping or caring for others.

It was an honor to support a well-known teacher. But Paul had not let the believers in Corinth support him. Using irony, Paul asked them if they were upset about his not letting them support him (11:7). Using irony again, he told them that churches in other cities had supported him while he lived in Corinth so that he could serve them full time (11:8–9). But the false teachers probably did the culturally expected thing and accepted money from the believers. Paul explained that he loved the believers in Corinth and therefore had not accepted their money (11:10–11). This example of love showed that the false teachers were not equals with Paul as apostles (11:12).

He described the way he would speak as “foolishness.” Paul used the term “foolishness” here in a special way. In this chapter Paul said he was “foolish” because he praised himself for his own good character, attitudes, and actions. He called this praise “foolish” especially because he had just said in 10:17–18 that believers should not praise themselves.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul was very concerned for the believers in Corinth, like a father wanting his daughter to be faithful to the man whom she would marry one day (11:2). In the same way he worried that the false teachers might have led the believers away from following Jesus (11:3–4).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Since the false teachers had deceived some of the believers in Corinth, Paul had to defend himself to the believers (11:5–6). The false teachers had praised themselves and some of the believers had believed them, so Paul had to praise himself. He reminded them that he had not allowed them to support him. He wanted them to know that he was serving them because he truly loved them and wanted to help them, unlike the false teachers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek culture, a teacher expected those whom he taught to support him. It was an honor to support a well-known teacher. But Paul had not let the believers in Corinth support him. Using irony, Paul asked them if they were upset about his not letting them support him (11:7). Using irony again, he told them that churches in other cities had supported him while he lived in Corinth so that he could serve them full time (11:8–9). But the false teachers probably did the culturally expected thing and accepted money from the believers. Paul explained that he loved the believers in Corinth and therefore had not accepted their money (11:10–11). This example of love showed that the false teachers were not equals with Paul as apostles (11:12). He described the false teachers as claiming to be apostles while actually following Satan (11:13–15).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples for this section heading are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul Contrasts Himself With False Apostles (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul and His Opponents (NET)</p></blockquote></div><h4>11:15a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:15a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>It is not surprising, then,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>So, it is no surprise</p></li><li><p>So then, expect</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>It is not surprising, then:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>then</em> introduces a conclusion. In some languages it is more natural to have the conjunction at the beginning of the verse. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Therefore it is not surprising (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So it is not strange (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>It is not surprising:</strong> The Greek words are literally “(it is) no great thing.” This phrase indicates that people can expect Satan’s servants to masquerade as servants of righteousness.

If that is true in your language, indicate the correct meaning. One way is to use the word “when” instead of <em>if</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>if his servants masquerade:</strong> The Greek here includes the word that means “also” here. Satan’s servants copy his behavior. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if his servants also disguise themselves (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>servants of righteousness:</strong> The word <em>of</em> indicates here that the <em>servants</em> do things that God considers right to do.

Jesus never boasted about himself.

Hughes (on TW) translates the Greek text as “I speak not after the Lord.” “After” here has the sense of “according to.” He says that boasting about oneself is “incompatible with the Lord’s example of humility.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Lord:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Lord</em> means “the one in authority over (something)” or “master.” The word <em>Lord</em> refers to Jesus here.

Paul probably used this word in contempt of them and their supporters. But this word may refer to people in general who boast of themselves, and the false teachers are just a part of this larger group. The believers in Corinth would know that Paul was referring to the false teachers in one of the above ways. Follow the literal Greek and do not describe who the <em>many</em> are.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, in some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer to people other than the false teachers. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Paul referred to the false teachers with the word “many.” He may have mocked them by calling them “many” when they were not. Or he may have included them in a larger group of non-believers who boasted about themselves.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>according to the flesh:</strong> There are a number of ways to interpret this phrase. The four most likely ways are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The phrase refers to <u>the way in which they boasted</u>. They boasted as unbelievers boast. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>according to human standards (NRSV) <em>(BSB, NIV, NRSV, NABRE, NASB, NET, ESV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The phrase refers to <u>the content of the boasting</u>. They boasted about worldly things. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>about their lives in the world (NCV) <em>(RSV, NLT, REB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The phrase refers to <u>the purpose for boasting</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for merely human reasons (GNT) <em>(GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The phrase refers to <u>the basis of their boasting</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>on merely human grounds (NJB) <em>(NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because it is the same as the interpretation for the same phrase “according to” in 11:17a.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Thrall (p. 709) translates the Greek phrase as “in an unspiritual fashion.” She says, “It is in opposition to <em>kata kurion</em> of verse 17” (p. 715). Harris (p. 778) translates it as “as the world does.” Martin (p. 356) translates it as “as ‘people of the world.’”</span></span></p>",

But he wanted them to listen to what he was foolishly going to boast about (11:16b–d). He told them that Jesus would not foolishly boast in this way (11:17). He told them that he would boast in the way that the false teachers were boasting (11:18). Using irony, he rebuked them for accepting people who boasted (11:19), implying that they were wrong to accept the false teachers because the false teachers boasted about themselves. Again using irony, he told them that they should not tolerate the false teachers taking advantage of them (11:20–21a).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In 11:21b Paul began foolishly to boast about things similar to the ones that the false teachers boasted about. Recounting all his hardships, he showed that he was more devoted to serving Jesus than they were (11:23–29).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Then Paul explained the correct kind of boasting (11:30). He gave an example (11:32–33), with an oath to God to indicate he was not lying (11:31).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples for this section heading are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul Boasts About His Sufferings (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s Sufferings as an Apostle (ESV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>11:23a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">The clause “I am out of my mind to talk like this” stands between Paul’s question and his answer.

Translate it in a similar way to the rhetorical questions in 11:22.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>servants of Christ:</strong> This phrase refers to people who serve Christ. They serve him by preaching, teaching, evangelizing, and things like that. The false teachers claimed to be <em>servants of Christ</em> but actually served Satan (11:13–15).</p><h4>11:23b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:23b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I am speaking like I am out of my mind, but I am so much more:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>—I speak as if insane—I more so.

Paul boasted when he said that he served Christ more. He had already explained that such boasting was foolish (11:21b). So this clause is an apology for speaking like a fool. He exaggerated the meaning of “fool” by saying that he was insane. But Paul was not actually saying he was insane.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would wrongly indicate that Paul admitted to being insane. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Indicate that only the following words are “insane” words.

I am more.</p></blockquote></div><h4>11:23c–f</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 11:23c–f, Paul gave examples of how he served Christ more (11:23b).</p><h4>11:23c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:23c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in harder labor,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I have done <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> work much more,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">For example:</span> I have worked <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for God</span> much harder,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in harder labor:</strong> A literal translation of the Greek here is “much more in labor.” Here the phrase indicates that Paul worked much more for God than the false teachers did. He did much more preaching, teaching, evangelizing, and things like that.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer only to physical work or secular jobs. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I have done <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> work much more</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I have worked <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for God</span> much harder <span data-bnType=\"implied\">than they</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I have served <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> much more</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated the Greek word in 6:5 (“labor”).</p><h4>11:23d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:23d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in more imprisonments,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>been put in prison <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for the sake of Christ</span> more often,</p></li><li><p>and people put me in jail more times <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because I preached Christ</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in more imprisonments:</strong> This phrase refers to people putting Paul in prison because he preached about Jesus. Clement, a church leader who died about a hundred years after Jesus was born, wrote that people put Paul in prison seven times.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer only to being in prison for stealing, killing, or another crime. If that is true in your language, you may want to explain in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>been in prison <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for the sake of Christ</span> more frequently</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people put me in prison more frequently <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because I preached Christ</span></p></blockquote><h4>11:23e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:23e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in worse beatings,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>been beaten much more <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because I believe in Christ</span>,</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> beat/whipped me much worse <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because I follow Christ</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in worse beatings:</strong> Exactly who gave Paul these <em>beatings</em> is not important here.

Here is one way to do that:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">someone</span> flogged me</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>worse:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>worse</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>to a much greater extent</u> here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>hurt more (NCV) <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, NJB, NABRE, GW, CEV, NET, REB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>countless times</u> here. Paul exaggerated to indicate “very many times.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>without number (NASB) <em>(RSV, NASB, NLT, ESV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Harris (p. 791) and Furnish (p. 512) translate the Greek word as “far worse.” Thrall (p. 722) translates the Greek clause as “exceptionally subject to beatings.” Kistemaker (p. 388) translates the Greek word as “more severely.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>beatings:</strong> This word refers to someone using a whip to cut the skin or leave a painful red welt.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word can also refer to someone hitting with a hard stick or even with fists. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>whipped (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>scourged (REB)</p></blockquote><h4>11:23f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:23f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in frequent danger of death.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and many times I almost died.</p></li><li><p>and I have often been in danger of dying <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as I served Christ</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in frequent danger of death:</strong> The Greek words are literally “in deaths often.” The phrase refers to Paul almost being killed on numerous occasions. This phrase probably includes things such as people trying to kill Paul (Acts 21:31) as well as the danger of drowning in a shipwreck (Acts 27). Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>faced death again and again (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have been near death many times (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Many times I almost died</p></blockquote>",

Paul was probably beaten in a number of cities. People in each city would have their own rod, so Paul used the plural word <em>rods</em> when referring to all of these beatings. But in some languages the singular word is more natural. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a rod</p></blockquote><h4>11:25b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:25b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>once I was stoned,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>On one occasion I was hit by many stones <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in an attempt to kill me</span>.</p></li><li><p>One time people tried to kill me by throwing stones at me.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>once I was stoned:</strong> People threw stones at Paul, trying to kill him (Acts 14:19).

Paul had been on three different ships that were destroyed.

But some ships would travel far from land. The phrase <em>open sea</em> refers to parts of the sea from which no land can be seen. Paul floated on the open sea probably with help from a piece of wood from the wrecked ship. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I floated on the open sea for a night and a day</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I floated on the sea with no sight of land for a night and the following day</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a night and a day:</strong> This phrase refers to all or most of a night, and all or most of the following day.

Barrett (p. 288) translates it as “care.” Hodge (p. 276) refers to it as “solicitude.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>all the churches:</strong> This phrase probably refers to all the groups of believers that Paul had started. Paul probably meant implicitly other churches such as the ones at Colosse, Laodicea, and Rome. Paul did not start those churches, but he wrote to them to help them. But Paul may have been thinking of the churches in Judea, Samaria, and Syria as well. Translate the word <em>all</em> without adding any implied information.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>churches:</strong> Here the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>churches</em> refers generally to a gathering of people. Here, as almost always in the New Testament, it refers to groups of believers. See how you translated this word in 1:1 or 8:18.</p>",

Translate the correct meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Lord:</strong> This word means “the one in authority over others” or “master.” God has authority over all things. Another way to translate this word is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>ruler</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 4:5 or 8:5.</p><h4>11:31b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:31b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who is forever worthy of praise,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>he who is blessed for ever, (RSV)</p></li><li><p>is worthy to be praised forever.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who is forever worthy of praise:</strong> The Greek words are literally “the one being blessed into the ages.” Paul acknowledged that God is blessed for all eternity. The Greek words are not a command to bless God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who is blessed forever (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause tells the reader more about God. In some languages using the word <em>who</em> would indicate that there are other beings named God and only this one is <em>forever worthy of praise</em>. If that is true in your language, translate this clause in a way that tells more about God. One way to do that is to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He is to be praised forever.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>worthy of praise:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>praise</em> can mean:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>To bless.</p></li><li><p>To praise.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">As meaning (1), it indicates here that God is good and no one can make any of that goodness bad. As meaning (2), it refers to others praising him. Other ways to translate this Greek word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>blessed (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>honored</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>worthy to be praised</p></blockquote><h4>11:31c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:31c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>knows that I am not lying.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>knows that what I am saying to you is not a lie.</p></li><li><p>He <span data-bnType=\"implied\">himself</span> knows I am telling you the truth.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>knows that I am not lying:</strong> The verb <em>knows</em> refers to God knowing that Paul was not lying. In some languages it is more natural to use a positive statement here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>knows that I am telling the truth</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 11:31a–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The first and last parts of this saying (“The God and Father of the Lord Jesus…knows that I am not lying”) are an oath. Paul indicated that God was able to confirm that Paul was not lying about boasting in his weaknesses (11:30) and that the following verses were also true. The middle part (“who is forever worthy of praise”) is praise to God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is more natural to have the praise before or after the oath. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God is blessed forever! He is the God and Father of the Lord Jesus. He knows that I am not lying.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus knows that I am not lying. God is blessed forever!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Also, 11:31b emphasizes that God is worthy of praise. This God knows that Paul was not lying. In some languages using “who” in 11:31b indicates the wrong meaning. (See note in 11:31b.) If that is true in your language, you may need to indicate the emphasis elsewhere. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus is to be praised forever! <u>It is he who</u> knows that I am not lying.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus is to be praised forever! <u>He himself</u> knows that I am not lying.</p></blockquote></div>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the town/city of</span> Damascus</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>governor:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>governor</em> probably refers to the ruler over the city.

But he wanted them to listen to what he was foolishly going to boast about (11:16b–d). He told them that Jesus would not foolishly boast in this way (11:17). He told them that he would boast in the way that the false teachers were boasting (11:18). Using irony, he rebuked them for accepting people who boasted (11:19), implying that they were wrong to accept the false teachers because the false teachers boasted about themselves. Again using irony, he told them that they should not tolerate the false teachers taking advantage of them (11:20–21a).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In 11:21b Paul began foolishly to boast about things similar to the ones that the false teachers boasted about. Recounting all his hardships, he showed that he was more devoted to serving Jesus than they were (11:23–29).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Then Paul explained the correct kind of boasting (11:30). He gave an example (11:32–33), with an oath to God to indicate he was not lying (11:31).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other examples for this section heading are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul Boasts About His Sufferings (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s Sufferings as an Apostle (ESV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>11:33a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:33a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But I was lowered in a basket through a window in the wall</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But I was <span data-bnType=\"implied\">put</span> in a basket and lowered from a window in the wall of the city</p></li><li><p>But friends <span data-bnType=\"implied\">tied a long rope to</span> a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">large</span> basket and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">put</span> me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in it and</span> lowered it to the ground <span data-bnType=\"implied\">outside the town</span> through a small opening in the wall,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I was lowered:</strong> This clause is passive.

Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But I will now talk about visions and revelations given by the Lord</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but I will move on to visions and revelations from the Lord (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In 12:2a Paul spoke of the visions and revelations that he had seen <u>as if</u> another man had seen them. So you should <u>not</u> indicate here that the visions and revelations were <u>to Paul</u>. Translate only that he began to speak of them here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>visions:</strong> Here the word <em>visions</em> refers to seeing things in a supernatural way. It is like a dream, but the person is usually awake. It is something or someone that people usually cannot see, but God helps them to see it. People, by their own power, cannot see into heaven, but God enabled Paul to see into heaven (12:2). Such <em>visions</em> show a person something that is important for him to know.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>revelations:</strong> This word means “something unknown that someone shows/reveals.” It can be seen, heard, or revealed in some other way. Here it refers to God revealing something to Paul.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Let me explain,</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Normally people boast about their strengths. Here, by contrast, Paul boasted about his weaknesses (12:5b–c). In some languages it is more natural to translate the contrast. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is more natural to allow the context to indicate the connection and omit the conjunction.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Even if I wanted to boast:</strong> This clause indicates that Paul might desire or decide to boast at some time. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If I wanted to boast (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>then, if I do choose to boast (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But if I wish to boast (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>wanted to boast:</strong> Here Paul implied he could boast about things other than his weaknesses. This would include his visions, his deeds as an apostle, and so forth.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to add what Paul might boast about. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wanted to boast <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about other things</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wanted to boast <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about my strengths</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wanted to boast <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about the things that show I am strong in the Lord</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>boast:</strong> This word refers to praising someone or saying how good someone is. Normally it is not proper for a believer to speak highly of himself. In this context Paul chose not to boast about himself, but he made it clear that if he did, he would be telling the truth. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>speak <span data-bnType=\"implied\">very</span> highly about</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>praise</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>tell about how great/wonderful/good</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this word in 1:12 or 11:10.</p><h4>12:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I would not be a fool,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I would not speak like a fool,</p></li><li><p>I would not be foolish,</p></li></ul></div><h4>12:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because I would be speaking the truth.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because I would tell the truth.</p></li><li><p>because I would be telling you what actually happened.</p></li></ul></div><h4>12:6b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I would not be a fool, because I would be speaking the truth:</strong> 12:6c is the reason for Paul not being a fool (12:6b). In some languages it is more natural to translate the reason before the result. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I would be speaking the truth, so I would not be a fool</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">While it is foolish for a believer to boast about himself, because it is selfish to do that, it is even more foolish to boast untruthfully about what he has done. Paul implied here that the false teachers were fools because they lied when they boasted.</p><h4>12:6d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:6d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But I refrain,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But I avoid <span data-bnType=\"implied\">doing that</span>,</p></li><li><p>But I prevent myself <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from such boasting</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I refrain:</strong> The verb <em>refrain</em> refers to not doing something. Here Paul would <em>refrain</em> from selfish boasting. If people would not clearly see what Paul would <em>refrain</em> from, you may want to explain in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I refrain <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from boasting</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about myself</span></p></blockquote><h4>12:6e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:6e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so no one will credit me with more</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>in order that no one will give too high of status to me,</p></li><li><p>so that no one would hold/regard my name/reputation too highly.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>credit me with more:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>credit me with more</em> refers to considering someone to have high status. Paul did not want people to think that he was better or more important than other believers because he had visions and revelations. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>have a higher opinion of me (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>go too far in giving me high status</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>regard me beyond (NET)</p></blockquote><h4>12:6f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:6f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>than he sees in me or hears from me,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>rather than giving me status based on what I do and say.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I want people’s opinion of me</span> to be based on only what I have done and said.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>than he sees in me or hears from me:</strong> These words indicate that Paul wanted people to think of him based <u>only</u> on what he did and said.

Thrall takes over two pages to describe the problem and her reasoning for choosing interpretation (1).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to keep me from:</strong> The verb phrase <em>keep…from</em> refers here to preventing something. God allowed a physical ailment to affect Paul to prevent him from being conceited. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in order to prevent my (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So that I would not become (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in order that I might not</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>becoming conceited:</strong> This phrase refers to being overly proud of oneself. Paul, after seeing Paradise, might have become too proud because he had seen it. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>exalting myself (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>feel too proud (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>become arrogant (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>these surpassingly great revelations:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>surpassingly great</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It indicates that the revelations were <u>very great</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the exceptional greatness of the revelations (NJB) <em>(BSB, NIV, NJB, NRSV, NASB, NLT, CEV, NET, REB, NCV, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It indicates that there were <u>very many</u> revelations. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the abundance of revelations (RSV) <em>(RSV, NABRE, GW, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Harris (p. 828) translates the Greek phrase as “the extraordinary nature of the revelations.” Thrall (p. 772) translates it as “the extraordinary quality of the revelations.” Martin (p. 388) translates it as “the extraordinary revelations.” The GNT (“many wonderful”) interprets the Greek word both ways, but this seems unlikely here.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>these:</strong> This word indicates that Paul was speaking of the revelations in 12:2–4.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>surpassingly great:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates <em>surpassingly great</em> means “beyond measure, to the extreme, exceptional.” Other ways to translate the Greek word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>extraordinary character (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>magnificence (REB)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 12:7a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The reason occurs second here. In some languages it is more natural to have the reason first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I had these surpassingly great revelations, so to keep me from becoming conceited</p></blockquote></div><h4>12:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I was given a thorn in my flesh,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>a thorn in my body was given to me,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> allowed me to suffer <span data-bnType=\"implied\">an ailment</span> in my body.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I was given a thorn:</strong> This clause is passive. God allowed Satan to give the thorn to Paul. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> allowed a thorn to torment me</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>thorn:</strong> This is a metaphor. It probably refers to a physical ailment or continuous suffering of some kind. Paul never explained exactly what the <em>thorn</em> was.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation would wrongly refer only to an actual thorn. If that is true in your language, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Translate literally and explain the meaning in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The word “thorn” is a metaphor. It probably refers to a physical ailment or suffering of some kind.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Explain the meaning in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>thorn, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">namely, this suffering I endure</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>suffering</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in my flesh:</strong> This phrase refers to Paul’s body. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in my body</p></blockquote><h4>12:7c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:7c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>a messenger of Satan, to torment me.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>a messenger sent by Satan to make me suffer. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">This was</span> to keep me from becoming too proud.</p></li><li><p>It was <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> a messenger whom Satan sent to hit me again and again. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">As I said,</span> the purpose of this suffering was to prevent me from setting myself above others.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a messenger of Satan:</strong> This phrase explains the phrase “a thorn in my flesh.” The word <em>messenger</em> could refer to:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>A demon tormenting Paul’s body in some way.</p></li><li><p>A metaphor for the suffering. Satan caused Paul to suffer in some way.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate in a way that allows either one or both of these meanings.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Satan:</strong> The word <em>Satan</em> is the Hebrew name of the chief or leader of all the evil spirits. In Hebrew his name means “enemy.” He is the enemy of God and God’s people. Translate this word as you did in 2:11 and 11:14.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to torment me.:</strong> Paul repeated the phrase (“to keep me from becoming conceited,” 12:7a) here to emphasize that meaning. The BSB chose not to repeat it here. That meaning is more important than who was tormenting him. Paul realized that God’s purpose for this suffering was to keep Paul humble. Other ways to translate this emphasis are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to torment me—to keep me from exalting myself! (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to torment me. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">As I said, this was</span> to keep me from becoming conceited.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate “to keep me from becoming conceited” as you did in 12:7a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>torment:</strong> This word refers to hitting someone or causing someone pain in some way over a period of time. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>beat (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>make…suffer (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>cause pain</p></blockquote>",

Two of the main ones are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The <em>signs, wonders, and miracles</em> are <u>examples</u> of <em>The true marks of an apostle</em>.

They are not <em>The true marks of an apostle</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The signs of an apostle were performed among you with great perseverance <u>by</u> signs and wonders and powerful deeds (NASB) <em>(NASB, NET, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Thrall (p. 837) says “he has produced the recognised signs of apostleship.” Bruce (p. 250) seems to equate “the signs of a true apostle” with “signs and wonders and mighty works.” Hodge (pp. 291–292) says the “<em>signs, wonders, and mighty deeds</em>…are different designations for the same thing” (referring to the “signs of an apostle”).</span></span></p><h4>12:12a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:12a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The true marks of an apostle—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Truly/Indeed, the deeds that indicate someone is an apostle,</p></li><li><p>The characteristic acts of an apostle</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">12:12a begins with the Greek conjunction that probably means “indeed” here. It emphasizes that Paul did things that apostles do and the believers saw them. Some ways to translate this conjunction are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Truly (KJV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>certainly (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Indeed (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is more natural to omit the conjunction.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The true marks of an apostle:</strong> This phrase refers to deeds that show a person is a true apostle of Jesus. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The signs of a true apostle (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the things that prove I am an apostle (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The characteristic acts of an apostle</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to put the list “signs, wonders, and miracles” before the phrase <em>true marks of an apostle</em>.

It is not a complete list, because Paul lists other examples in other verses. You may want to indicate in your translation that this list offers some (but not all) examples of the things that mark an apostle. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">such as</span> signs, wonders, and miracles</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">for example,</span> signs, wonders, and miracles</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>signs:</strong> The word <em>signs</em> refers to unusual events that people regard as having special meaning. A sign suggests or points to a meaning other than its own. Here the word probably refers to miracles that clearly indicated that Paul was an apostle of Jesus. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>miraculous signs</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>miracles of proof</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>wonders:</strong> This word refers to miracles that amaze people.

When a human being does a miracle, he must use greater power than human beings normally have. Paul used God’s power to do miracles, and these miracles demonstrated that God was working through him. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>mighty works</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>amazing acts <span data-bnType=\"implied\">done with/by God’s power</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wonderful actions that only God can empower</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>supernatural deeds</p></blockquote><h4>12:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>were performed among you with great perseverance.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>were done with <span data-bnType=\"implied\">patient</span> endurance when I was with you<sup>(plur)</sup>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> did those things among you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">through me</span> as I was very patient <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with you</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>were performed:</strong> The clause “things…were performed” is passive. Paul probably implied that God performed the signs, wonders, and miracles. He did them through Paul. But Paul may be humbly referring to himself by using the passive. Some languages must use an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> did <span data-bnType=\"implied\">through me</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span> did</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>among you:</strong> God (through Paul) did the signs, wonders, and miracles so that the believers in Corinth saw them. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When I was with you (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You saw</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>perseverance:</strong> This word refers to continuing to follow God even though there are hardships or opposition. The attitude of patience is included in the meaning. Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">patient</span> endurance</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>patiently (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated this Greek word in 1:6 (where the BSB translates it as “patient endurance”) or 6:4 (where the BSB translates it as “endurance”).</p>",

It emphasizes the meaning, “You were not inferior to other churches, except that I was not a burden to you.” This question <u>is also irony</u> because Paul asked them how they were inferior when he wanted them to know that they were not inferior. Paul had not been a burden to them, but that was no reason to feel inferior. Translate in a way that emphasizes that meaning. Some ways to translate this are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question.

Paul knew he deserved praise from them and was better than the false teachers even though humanly speaking he deserved nothing (12:11b–d). Paul reminded the believers of all that he had done among them that proved he was an apostle (12:12). He asked them if they were angry at him with a rhetorical question and, using irony, told them that they should not be angry (12:13).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">He told them that he would continue to avoid accepting their money for his support and explained why (12:14). He told them of his great love for them (12:15).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Using irony, Paul told them that he had not deceived them (12:16) and that his colleagues had not exploited them either (12:17–18). He explained that he had not been defending himself, but rather he was teaching them to be strong in their faith (12:19).

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>perversion (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>filthy sexual sins</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>sexual immorality:</strong> Here the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>sexual immorality</em> refers to prostitution and sex between people who are not married.

He said he would do that because some believers in Corinth were demanding proof from him that he was a true apostle (13:3a). He told them that he could work powerfully because Jesus is powerful (13:3b).

Paul expected that if they studied Paul’s words and deeds, then they would see that he was a true apostle (13:6). Paul told them that he and his coworkers prayed for the believers in Corinth that they would not sin and that they would do what was right (13:7). Paul told them that he and his coworkers worked in accordance with the truth (13:8). He told the believers that he prayed that they would always do as God wanted them to do (13:9). He told them that he wrote about their problems so that they would correct those problems themselves.

The first time is described in parts (a) and (c). The second time is described in parts (b) and (d). Paul probably told both groups, (e) and (f), both times. In English, it is more natural to have the parts in this order: (c), (a), (e), (f), (g), (h), (d), (b). This becomes:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When I was present the second time, I have foretold to the ones having sinned previously and to all of the rest that if I come again I will not spare <span data-bnType=\"implied\">anyone</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who is still sinning</span>. And now being absent I say beforehand <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that same warning</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">It is also possible, from the order of the Greek phrases, that (e) goes with (a) and (c) and that (f) goes with (b) and (d).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This option would translate as: “When I was present the second time, I have foretold to the ones having sinned previously that if I come again I will not spare <span data-bnType=\"implied\">anyone</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who is still sinning</span>. And now being absent I say beforehand <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that same warning</span> to all of the rest.”</span></span> But the warning was probably told to everyone both times.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Display has moved (e) and (f) to be the hearers of the warning, which follows the Greek.</p><h4>13:2a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"13:2a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I already warned you the second time I was with you.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>When I visited you<sup>(plur)</sup> the second time, I warned those who sinned earlier and all the others.</p></li><li><p>During my second visit, I warned those who sinned in the past and all the others <span data-bnType=\"implied\">there</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the second time I was with you:</strong> This clause refers to the previous visit that Paul made to Corinth. That was his second visit there. He was about to visit them the third time. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when I was there on my second visit (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>during my second visit to you (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>13:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"13:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So now in my absence I warn those who sinned earlier and everyone else:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Now while I am not yet there, I repeat what I said beforehand,</p></li><li><p>Before I come <span data-bnType=\"implied\">there</span>, I now warn again ahead of my next visit <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to you</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>now in my absence I warn:</strong> This clause indicates that Paul warned them again in this letter. The Corinthians received this letter <u>before</u> he arrived there. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will say it again now that I am away (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>though I am not with you, I give notice again (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I now repeat it before I am with you again</p></blockquote><h4>13:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"13:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>If I return, I will not spare anyone,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>that if I come back there I will not let any of them escape punishment.</p></li><li><p>that when I return I will not have mercy <span data-bnType=\"implied\">on any who have not repented</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those who sinned earlier and everyone else: If I return, I will not spare anyone:</strong> In the Greek the phrases <em>those who sinned earlier and everyone else</em> refer to those whom Paul warned (13:2a–b). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I warned <u>those who sinned before and all the others</u>, and I warn them now while absent, as I did when present on my second visit, that if I come again I will not spare them (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The meaning lines in the Display move those phrases to 13:2a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>If I return, I will not spare anyone:</strong> The Greek words are literally “if I come again I will not spare.” When Paul was with them the previous time, he was probably not sure that he would return. So he used the word “if.” Later, when he wrote this letter, he was planning to return to Corinth. But he used the word “if” again, as he did the first time he warned them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if I come again I will not spare them (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">But in some languages using “if” would indicate that Paul might not visit them a third time. If that is true in your language, translate without using “if.”</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>I will not spare anyone:</strong> Here this phrase indicates that Paul would punish all who were sinning. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>I will punish all <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who deserve it</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>I will stop being patient <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with everyone who is sinning</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>I shall have no mercy (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>I will not be lenient (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>those who sinned earlier:</strong> The tense of the Greek verb probably indicates that these people were sinning during Paul’s second visit and had not repented at the time of this letter. This group were probably committing sexual sins as listed in 12:21, but they may also have been committing other sins. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who sinned earlier and have not repented</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who have sinned before (NKJV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who had sinned before that visit (JBP)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>everyone else:</strong> This phrase may refer to:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>People who began sinning after Paul’s second visit. They may have sinned as listed in 12:20 or by following the false teachers. (The false teachers came after Paul’s second visit.)</p></li><li><p>The rest of the believers. The second warning would be to warn them not to begin sinning.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">These are two very different groups, and it is not clear which interpretation is correct. So, translate this phrase in a general way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all the others (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all the rest (NASB)</p></blockquote>",

Paul probably emphasized these pronouns because some of the believers were wrongly examining and testing Paul. They were doing that because they doubted that he was a true apostle. Some languages can emphasize the pronoun in a natural way. Some examples in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>It is yourselves whom</u> you must examine…<u>it is yourselves whom</u> you must test</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>You are the ones</u> you need to examine…test <u>yourselves</u> to see if your faith is true/genuine</p></blockquote><h4>13:5a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"13:5a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Examine yourselves to see if you have <span data-bnType=\"implied\">true</span> faith</p></li><li><p>¶ It is you yourselves that you must examine to discover the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">true</span> nature of your faith</p></li><li><p>¶ Look at your own ways, do they match the ways of faith?</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to see whether you are in the faith:</strong> The clause <em>you are in the faith</em> refers to living and believing according to Christian teaching. Paul commanded them here to prove that they were living the proper Christian way. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to see whether you are holding to your faith (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to find out whether you are living in faith (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>find out if you really are true to your faith (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>are you living the life of faith? (REB)</p></blockquote><h4>13:5c–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Can’t you see for yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you—unless you actually fail the test?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. Paul expected the believers to answer that they knew that Jesus was in them. But he used the rhetorical question to imply that some of them might not be completely following proper Christian ways (13:5a–b). These words exhort the believers to live according to the fact that Jesus was in them. Translate in a way that indicates that meaning. Some ways to translate this are:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do you not recognise yourselves as people in whom Jesus Christ is present?—unless, that is, you fail the test. (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Don’t you recognize that you are people in whom Jesus Christ lives? Could it be that you’re failing the test? (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Surely you recognize that Jesus Christ is present in you, don’t you? If not, you have failed the test.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You ought to know by this time that Christ is in you, unless you are not real Christians at all. (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You know that Jesus Christ is in you—unless you fail the test. (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>13:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"13:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Can’t you see for yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Do you not recognize yourselves as people in whom Jesus Christ is present? (NJB)</p></li><li><p>Certainly you know that Jesus Christ is in you!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Jesus Christ:</strong> There is a textual issue here. The Greek manuscripts differ in the order of these two words:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The order of the words is <u>Jesus Christ</u>. For example, see the BSB. <em>(BSB, RSV, NJB, NASB, NABRE, NLT, GW, NET, REB, NCV, ESV, KJV)</em></p></li><li><p>The order of the words is <u>Christ Jesus</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ Jesus (GNT) <em>(NIV, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1) because the UBS Greek New Testament has that order.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The meaning is basically the same in either order. But having “Christ” first emphasizes that Jesus is the <u>Christ</u>.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>is in you:</strong> This phrase refers to Jesus encouraging, guiding, correcting, and helping the believers, both individually and as a group. The believers experience changes in their lives because they follow Jesus. Other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>people in whom Jesus Christ is present (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>walks with/guides you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>lives in your heart/insides</p></blockquote><h4>13:5d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"13:5d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>unless you actually fail the test?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But perhaps you will examine yourselves and find that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has not approved you!</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I do not expect many of</span> you to be unable to prove that you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">truly believe</span>!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>unless you actually fail the test:</strong> This is irony. To <em>fail the test</em> refers here to not having faith. Paul expected the believers to pass the test. But Paul used irony to encourage them to examine themselves. He probably implied that a few people in the church in Corinth did not truly believe or had sinned greatly. For the irony you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate in a way that clearly shows the irony. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>unless you have completely failed (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the irony with a rhetorical question or a rhetorical “if.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Could it be that you’re failing the test?

Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you are unable to prove <span data-bnType=\"implied\">your faith</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you cannot pass the test</p></blockquote>",

He said he would do that because some believers in Corinth were demanding proof from him that he was a true apostle (13:3a). He told them that he could work powerfully because Jesus is powerful (13:3b). He told them that they were weak in their natural abilities but had God’s power, as Jesus did when he lived on earth (13:4).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Then Paul commanded them to look carefully at themselves to see if they were truly believers or not (13:5). Paul expected that if they studied Paul’s words and deeds, then they would see that he was a true apostle (13:6). Paul told them that he and his coworkers prayed for the believers in Corinth that they would not sin and that they would do what was right (13:7). Paul told them that he and his coworkers worked in accordance with the truth (13:8). He told the believers that he prayed that they would always do as God wanted them to do (13:9).

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>brothers and sisters (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>fellow believers</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>rejoice:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates literally as <em>rejoice</em> can be interpreted in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Greek word is <u>a command to rejoice</u>. It goes with the other four commands in 13:11b–c. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>rejoice (NASB) <em>(BSB, NJB, NASB, NABRE, ESV, NLT, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Greek word means <u>good-bye</u>.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>farewell (RSV) <em>(RSV, NIV, GNT, GW, CEV, REB, NCV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), since there is no other place in the New Testament where this Greek word clearly means “good-bye.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Harris (p. 932) lists four other reasons the Greek word should be translated as “rejoice.” Martin (p. 490), Thrall (p. 904), and many other commentators believe it means “rejoice” here.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate this Greek word according to interpretation (1) are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Be joyful (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we wish you joy (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>be glad</p></blockquote><h4>13:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"13:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Aim for perfect harmony, encourage one another,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>be restored to perfection, do what I have urged you to do,</p></li><li><p>to allow God to enable you to mature <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in faith</span>, and to listen to my advice.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Aim for perfect harmony:</strong> The Greek is literally “be perfected.” Like the similar Greek noun in 13:9b, this Greek verb, which the BSB translates as <em>Aim for perfect harmony</em>, refers to the process of restoring or repairing something so that it works perfectly. As a command, Paul told the believers to restore themselves or to allow God to restore them. Other ways to translate this Greek word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>work at your restoration</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>allow God to correct you until you have no faults</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>change your ways of thinking and behaving so they will be completely proper</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>encourage one another:</strong> English versions translate the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>encourage one another</em> in three ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>heed/listen to Paul’s requests/exhortations</u> here. Paul urged them in many ways in this letter. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>heed my appeal (RSV) <em>(RSV, NIV, GNT, GW, CEV, REB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>help one another to be strong</u> here.

In some languages it is more natural to allow the context to indicate the connection and omit the conjunction.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the God of love and peace will be with you:</strong> The phrase <em>the God of love and peace</em> indicates that God is the source of love and peace. He enables believers to love one another and other people. And he enables believers to live peacefully.
